Argued February 23, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010*\nIt is a federal crime to \u201cknowingly provid[e] material support or re\n  sources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339B(a)(1).\n  The authority to designate an entity a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d\n  rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.\n  \u201c[T]he term \u2018material support or resources\u2019 means any property, tan\n  gible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary in\n  struments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training,\n  expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or iden\n  tification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal sub\n  stances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or\n  include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious ma\n  terials.\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(1). Over the years, \u00a72339B and the definition of\n  \u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d have been amended, inter alia, to\n  clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group\u2019s des\n  ignation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts,\n  \u00a72339B(a)(1); and to define the terms \u201ctraining,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(2), \u201cex\n  pert advice or assistance,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(3), and \u201cpersonnel,\u201d \u00a72339B(h).\n     Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated \u201cforeign\n  terrorist organization[s]\u201d are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK)\n  and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to es\n  tablish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and\n  Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although both groups engage in political and\n  humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist\n  attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens. Claiming\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 09\u201389, Humanitarian Law Project et al. v.\nHolder, Attorney General, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    they wish to support those groups\u2019 lawful, nonviolent activities, two\n    U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs)\n    initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support stat\n    ute. The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history. Ulti\n    mately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the\n    material-support statute against plaintiffs. After the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certio\n    rari. The Court granted both petitions.\n       As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge \u00a72339B\u2019s prohibi\n    tion on providing four types of material support\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert\n    advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014asserting violations\n    of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause on the ground that the\n    statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First\n    Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. They claim\n    that \u00a72339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging\n    in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use\n    international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK mem\n    bers to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies\n    for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living\n    in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.\nHeld: The material-support statute, \u00a72339B, is constitutional as applied\n to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to\n foreign terrorist organizations. Pp. 8\u201336.\n    (a) This preenforcement challenge to \u00a72339B is a justiciable Article\n III case or controversy. Plaintiffs face \u201ca credible threat of prosecu\n tion\u201d and \u201cshould not be required to await and undergo a criminal\n prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm\n Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. P. 10.\n    (b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga\n tion by accepting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the material-support stat\n ute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof\n that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization\u2019s\n illegal activities. That reading is inconsistent with \u00a72339B\u2019s text,\n which prohibits \u201cknowingly\u201d providing material support and demon\n strates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization\u2019s con\n nection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activi\n ties, as the necessary mental state for a violation. Plaintiffs\u2019 reading\n is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding\n \u00a72339B, which\u2014unlike \u00a72339B\u2014do refer to intent to further terrorist\n activity. See \u00a7\u00a72339A(a), 2339C(a)(1). Finally, there is no textual\n basis for plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the same language in \u00a72339B\n should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but\n not with regard to other forms of material support. Pp. 10\u201312.\n    (c) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not un\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nconstitutionally vague. The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plain\ntiffs\u2019 vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, hold\ning that \u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and a portion of \u201cexpert advice or assis\ntance\u201d were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected\nspeech\u2014regardless of whether those applications were clear. The\nCourt of Appeals also contravened the rule that \u201c[a] plaintiff who en\ngages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of\nthe vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d Hoff\nman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.\n   The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, \u201cpro\nvide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohib\nited.\u201d United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304. The statutory\nterms at issue here\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cser\nvice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014are quite different from the sorts of terms,\nlike \u201c \u2018annoying\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018indecent,\u2019 \u201d that the Court has struck down for\nrequiring \u201cwholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,\nnarrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\u201d Id., at 306. Congress\nhas increased the clarity of \u00a72339B\u2019s terms by adding narrowing\ndefinitions, and \u00a72339B\u2019s knowledge requirement further reduces any\npotential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.\n   Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dis\npositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plain\ntiffs\u2019 proposed conduct. Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek\nto engage readily fall within the scope of \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert ad\nvice or assistance.\u201d In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly\nused those terms to describe their own proposed activities. Plaintiffs\u2019\nresort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of \u201ctraining\u201d and\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d is beside the point because this litiga\ntion does not concern such situations. See Scales v. United States,\n367 U. S. 203, 223. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030,\n1049\u20131051, distinguished. Plaintiffs\u2019 further contention, that the\nstatute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish\nto undertake, runs afoul of \u00a72339B(h), which makes clear that \u201cper\nsonnel\u201d does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independ\nently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cservice,\u201d which refers to concerted activity, not independent advo\ncacy. Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a\ncause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service \u201cto a\nforeign terrorist organization.\u201d \u00a72339B(a)(1).\n   Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage\nis not prohibited by \u00a72339B. On the other hand, a person of ordinary\nintelligence would understand the term \u201cservice\u201d to cover advocacy\nperformed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign ter\nrorist organization. Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the\n4             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or co\n    ordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a \u201cservice.\u201d Be\n    cause plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the de\n    gree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK\n    and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement\n    challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Repub\n    lican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454. Pp. 13\u201320.\n       (d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not\n    violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 20\u201334.\n         (1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on\n    this question. Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure\n    political speech. That claim is unfounded because, under the mate\n    rial-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.\n    Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or member\n    ship in the PKK and LTTE. Rather, Congress has prohibited \u201cmate\n    rial support,\u201d which most often does not take the form of speech. And\n    when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\n    category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with\n    foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.\n    On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only\n    thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the cor\n    rect standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United\n    States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377. That standard is not used to\n    review a content-based regulation of speech, and \u00a72339B regulates\n    plaintiffs\u2019 speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its con\n    tent. Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a\n    regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering\n    coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.\n    Thus, the Court \u201cmust [apply] a more demanding standard\u201d than the\n    one described in O\u2019Brien. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403. Pp.\n    20\u201323.\n         (2) The parties agree that the Government\u2019s interest in combat\n    ing terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs\n    argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech,\n    which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK\n    and LTTE. Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\n    segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terror\n    ism is an empirical question. Congress rejected plaintiffs\u2019 position on\n    that question when it enacted \u00a72339B, finding that \u201cforeign organiza\n    tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\n    conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that\n    conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following \u00a72339B. The record\n    confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 view. The\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nPKK and the LTTE are deadly groups. It is not difficult to conclude,\nas Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great\nthat working in coordination with them or at their command legiti\nmizes and furthers their terrorist means. Moreover, material sup\nport meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to\nadvance terrorism in multiple ways. The record shows that desig\nnated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\nfirewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or finan\ncial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and\nthose used to carry out terrorist attacks. Providing material support\nin any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to\nprevent terrorism and strain the United States\u2019 relationships with its\nallies, including those that are defending themselves against violent\ninsurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups. Pp. 23\u201328.\n     (3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual infer\nences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive\nBranch\u2019s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government\nagencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Con\ngress\u2019s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organiza\ntions\u2014even those for seemingly benign purposes\u2014further those\ngroups\u2019 terrorist activities. That evaluation of the facts, like Con\ngress\u2019s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive na\ntional security and foreign relations interests at stake. The Court\ndoes not defer to the Government\u2019s reading of the First Amendment.\nBut respect for the Government\u2019s factual conclusions is appropriate\nin light of the courts\u2019 lack of expertise with respect to national secu\nrity and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terror\nist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to ob\ntain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and\nconclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than\nconcrete evidence. The Court also finds it significant that Congress\nhas been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its ac\ntions may implicate constitutional concerns. Most importantly, Con\ngress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed\nany activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by for\neign terrorist groups. Given the sensitive interests in national secu\nrity and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have ade\nquately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material\nsupport in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services\nto foreign terrorist groups serves the Government\u2019s interest in pre\nventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to pro\nmote only the groups\u2019 nonviolent ends.\n   As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is\nwholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use in\n6             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in\n    formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat\n    egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\n    Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could\n    help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.\n    Plaintiffs\u2019 proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of\n    Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot\n    prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide\n    whether any future applications of the material-support statute to\n    speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply\n    holds that \u00a72339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied\n    to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.\n    28\u201334.\n         (e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs\u2019 First\n    Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute\n    criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the\n    LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court\u2019s precedents. The Ninth\n    Circuit correctly rejected this claim because \u00a72339B does not penalize\n    mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist\n    groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of asso\n    ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for\n    eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the\n    same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

The District Court in this action found that\nthe PKK and the LTTE engage in political and humanitar\u00ad\nian activities. See 9 F. Supp. 2d, at 1180\u20131182. The\nGovernment has presented evidence that both groups have\nalso committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which\n4            HOLDER v.

The\nLTTE sought judicial review of its designation as a foreign\nterrorist organization; the D. C. Circuit upheld that desig\u00ad\nnation. See People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran v.\nDept. of State, 182 F. 3d 17, 18\u201319, 25 (1999). The PKK\ndid not challenge its designation. 9 F.

Brief for Petitioners in No. 09\u201389, pp. ii, 10 (here\u00ad\ninafter Brief for Plaintiffs); App. 48. In 1998, plaintiffs\nfiled suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality\nof the material-support statute, \u00a72339B.              Plaintiffs\nclaimed that they wished to provide support for the hu\u00ad\nmanitarian and political activities of the PKK and the\nLTTE in the form of monetary contributions, other tangi\u00ad\nble aid, legal training, and political advocacy, but that\nthey could not do so for fear of prosecution under \u00a72339B.\n9 F.

C. \u00a72339A(b) (2000 ed.)\ndefined \u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d to mean \u201ccurrency or other\nfinancial securities, financial services, lodging, training, safehouses,\nfalse documentation or identification, communications equipment,\nfacilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel, transporta\u00ad\ntion, and other physical assets, except medicine or religious materials.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport statute was unconstitutional on two grounds:\nFirst, it violated their freedom of speech and freedom of\nassociation under the First Amendment, because it crimi\u00ad\nnalized their provision of material support to the PKK and\nthe LTTE, without requiring the Government to prove\nthat plaintiffs had a specific intent to further the unlawful\nends of those organizations. Id., at 1184. Second, plain\u00ad\ntiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.\nId., at 1184\u20131185.\n   Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the\nDistrict Court granted in part. The District Court held\nthat plaintiffs had not established a probability of success\non their First Amendment speech and association claims.\nSee id., at 1196\u20131197. But the court held that plaintiffs\nhad established a probability of success on their claim\nthat, as applied to them, the statutory terms \u201cpersonnel\u201d\nand \u201ctraining\u201d in the definition of \u201cmaterial support\u201d were\nimpermissibly vague. See id., at 1204.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138\n(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 speech and\nassociation claims, including their claim that \u00a72339B\nviolated the First Amendment in barring them from con\u00ad\ntributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at\n1133\u20131136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that the terms \u201cpersonnel\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d\nwere vague because it was \u201ceasy to imagine protected\nexpression that falls within the bounds\u201d of those terms.\nId., at 1138; see id., at 1137.\n   With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the\naction returned to the District Court, and the parties\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits. The District\nCourt entered a permanent injunction against applying to\nplaintiffs the bans on \u201cpersonnel\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d support.\nSee No. CV\u201398\u20131971 ABC (BQRx), 2001 WL 36105333\n(CD Cal., Oct. 2, 2001). The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n352 F. 3d 382 (CA9 2003).\n6         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Meanwhile, in 2001, Congress amended the definition of\n\u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d to add the term \u201cexpert\nadvice or assistance.\u201d Uniting and Strengthening America\nby Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and\nObstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act),\n\u00a7805(a)(2)(B), 115 Stat. 377. In 2003, plaintiffs filed a\nsecond action challenging the constitutionality of that\nterm as applied to them. 309 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1192 (CD\nCal. 2004).\n   In that action, the Government argued that plaintiffs\nlacked standing and that their preenforcement claims\nwere not ripe. Id., at 1194. The District Court held that\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims were justiciable because plaintiffs had\nsufficiently demonstrated a \u201cgenuine threat of imminent\nprosecution,\u201d id., at 1195 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted), and because \u00a72339B had the potential to chill plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 protected expression, see id., at 1197\u20131198. On the\nmerits, the District Court held that the term \u201cexpert ad\u00ad\nvice or assistance\u201d was impermissibly vague. Id., at 1201.\nThe District Court rejected, however, plaintiffs\u2019 First\nAmendment claims that the new term was substantially\noverbroad and criminalized associational speech. See id.,\nat 1202, 1203.\n   The parties cross-appealed. While the cross-appeals\nwere pending, the Ninth Circuit granted en banc rehear\u00ad\ning of the panel\u2019s 2003 decision in plaintiffs\u2019 first action\n(involving the terms \u201cpersonnel\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d). See 382\nF. 3d 1154, 1155 (2004). The en banc court heard reargu\u00ad\nment on December 14, 2004. See 380 F. Supp. 2d 1134,\n1138 (CD Cal. 2005). Three days later, Congress again\namended \u00a72339B and the definition of \u201cmaterial support\nor resources.\u201d Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Preven\u00ad\ntion Act of 2004 (IRTPA), \u00a76603, 118 Stat. 3762\u20133764.\n   In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary\nto violate \u00a72339B, requiring knowledge of the foreign\ngroup\u2019s designation as a terrorist organization or the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngroup\u2019s commission of terrorist acts. \u00a72339B(a)(1). Con\u00ad\ngress also added the term \u201cservice\u201d to the definition of\n\u201cmaterial support or resources,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(1), and defined\n\u201ctraining\u201d to mean \u201cinstruction or teaching designed to\nimpart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,\u201d\n\u00a72339A(b)(2). It also defined \u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d\nto mean \u201cadvice or assistance derived from scientific,\ntechnical or other specialized knowledge.\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(3).\nFinally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d\nby providing:\n    \u201cNo person may be prosecuted under [\u00a72339B] in con\u00ad\n    nection with the term \u2018personnel\u2019 unless that person\n    has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or con\u00ad\n    spired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with\n    1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself)\n    to work under that terrorist organization\u2019s direction\n    or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or other\u00ad\n    wise direct the operation of that organization. Indi\u00ad\n    viduals who act entirely independently of the foreign\n    terrorist organization to advance its goals or objec\u00ad\n    tives shall not be considered to be working under the\n    foreign terrorist organization\u2019s direction and control.\u201d\n    \u00a72339B(h).\n   Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc\nCourt of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs\u2019 first action.\n393 F. 3d 902, 903 (CA9 2004). The en banc court af\u00ad\nfirmed the rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claims\nfor the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s panel deci\u00ad\nsion in 2000. See ibid. In light of IRTPA, however, the en\nbanc court vacated the panel\u2019s 2003 judgment with respect\nto vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for\nfurther proceedings. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit panel as\u00ad\nsigned to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs\u2019 second action\n(relating to \u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d) also remanded in\nlight of IRTPA. See 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1139.\n8         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court consolidated the two actions on re\u00ad\nmand. See ibid. The court also allowed plaintiffs to chal\u00ad\nlenge the new term \u201cservice.\u201d See id., at 1151, n. 24. The\nparties moved for summary judgment, and the District\nCourt granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness\ngrounds. See id., at 1156.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed once more. 552 F. 3d\n916, 933 (CA9 2009). The court first rejected plaintiffs\u2019\nclaim that the material-support statute would violate due\nprocess unless it were read to require a specific intent to\nfurther the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee id., at 926\u2013927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the\nstatute was not overbroad in violation of the First\nAmendment. See id., at 931\u2013932. As for vagueness, the\nCourt of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a\n\u201cfacial vagueness challenge.\u201d Id., at 929, n. 6. The court\nheld that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms \u201ctraining,\u201d\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d (when derived from \u201cother\nspecialized knowledge\u201d), and \u201cservice\u201d were vague because\nthey \u201ccontinue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo\u00ad\ncacy,\u201d but the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d was not vague because it\n\u201cno longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment.\u201d Id., at 929\u2013931.\n   The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs\nfiled a conditional cross-petition. We granted both peti\u00ad\ntions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation,\nwe pause to clarify the questions before us. Plaintiffs\nchallenge \u00a72339B\u2019s prohibition on four types of material\nsupport\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cser\u00ad\nvice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel.\u201d They raise three constitutional\nclaims. First, plaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B violates the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these\nfour statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B violates their freedom of\nspeech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs\nclaim that \u00a72339B violates their First Amendment free\u00ad\ndom of association.\n   Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in\nall their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B\nis invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in\ncertain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16\u201317,\nn. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those\nactivities are: (1) \u201ctrain[ing] members of [the] PKK on how\nto use humanitarian and international law to peacefully\nresolve disputes\u201d; (2) \u201cengag[ing] in political advocacy on\nbehalf of Kurds who live in Turkey\u201d; and (3) \u201cteach[ing]\nPKK members how to petition various representative\nbodies such as the United Nations for relief.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at\n921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the\nother plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) \u201ctrain[ing] mem\u00ad\nbers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related\naid to mediators and international bodies\u201d; (2) \u201coffer[ing]\ntheir legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements\nbetween the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government\u201d; and\n(3) \u201cengag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils\nwho live in Sri Lanka.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1137.\n   Plaintiffs also state that \u201cthe LTTE was recently de\u00ad\nfeated militarily in Sri Lanka,\u201d so \u201c[m]uch of the support\nthe Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to\nprovide is now moot.\u201d Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain\u00ad\ntiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE \u201cas a political\norganization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of\nTamils.\u201d Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at\noral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the\nLTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,\nbecause the LTTE now \u201chas no role in Sri Lanka.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate\na peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwell. Thus, we do not consider the application of \u00a72339B\nto those activities here.\n   One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of\na criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must\nbe sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under\nArticle III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face \u201ca credi\u00ad\nble threat of prosecution\u201d and \u201cshould not be required to\nawait and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole\nmeans of seeking relief.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442\nU. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.\n118, 128\u2013129 (2007).\n   Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK\nand the LTTE before the enactment of \u00a72339B and that\nthey would provide similar support again if the statute\u2019s\nallegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.         See 309\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has\ncharged about 150 persons with violating \u00a72339B, and\nthat several of those prosecutions involved the enforce\u00ad\nment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for\nGovernment 5. The Government has not argued to this\nCourt that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what\nthey say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\u201358. See\nBabbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop & Milav\netz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce\u00ad\nment challenge brought under the First Amendment).\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope\nafter 12 years of litigation).\n                            III\n  Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should\naffirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of\nconstitutional law. They contend that we should interpret\nthe material-support statute, when applied to speech, to\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire proof that a defendant intended to further a for\u00ad\neign terrorist organization\u2019s illegal activities. That inter\u00ad\npretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do\nnot intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the\nLTTE.\n   We reject plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a72339B because it\nis inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section\n2339B(a)(1) prohibits \u201cknowingly\u201d providing material\nsupport. It then specifically describes the type of knowl\u00ad\nedge that is required: \u201cTo violate this paragraph, a per\u00ad\nson must have knowledge that the organization is a\ndesignated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza\u00ad\ntion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or\nthat the organization has engaged or engages in terror\u00ad\nism. . . .\u201d Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary\nmental state for a violation of \u00a72339B, and it chose\nknowledge about the organization\u2019s connection to terror\u00ad\nism, not specific intent to further the organization\u2019s\nterrorist activities.\n   Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is also untenable in light of the\nsections immediately surrounding \u00a72339B, both of which\ndo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.           See\n\u00a72339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who\n\u201cprovides material support or resources . . . knowing or\nintending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in\ncarrying out, a violation of\u201d statutes prohibiting violent\nterrorist acts); \u00a72339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for\none who \u201cunlawfully and willfully provides or collects\nfunds with the intention that such funds be used, or with\nthe knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in\npart, in order to carry out\u201d other unlawful acts). Congress\nenacted \u00a72339A in 1994 and \u00a72339C in 2002.                  See\n\u00a7120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (\u00a72339A); \u00a7202(a), 116 Stat.\n724 (\u00a72339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent\nlanguage of those provisions into \u00a72339B, either when it\n12         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted \u00a72339B in 1996, or when it clarified \u00a72339B\u2019s\nknowledge requirement in 2004.\n   Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue\nthat a specific intent requirement should apply only when\nthe material-support statute applies to speech. There is\nno basis whatever in the text of \u00a72339B to read the same\nprovisions in that statute as requiring intent in some\ncircumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that\nplaintiffs are asking us not to interpret \u00a72339B, but to\nrevise it. \u201cAlthough this Court will often strain to con\u00ad\nstrue legislation so as to save it against constitutional\nattack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of\nperverting the purpose of a statute.\u201d Scales v. United\nStates, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).\n   Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,\nbut it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the\nSmith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo\u00ad\ncating the violent overthrow of the government. The\nCourt held that a person could not be convicted under the\nstatute unless he had knowledge of the group\u2019s illegal\nadvocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over\u00ad\nthrow. Id., at 220\u2013222, 229. This action is different:\nSection 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro\u00ad\nhibits providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to such a group. See\ninfra, at 20\u201321, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the\nneed for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The\nCourt in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text\nand precedent that had interpreted closely related provi\u00ad\nsions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U. S.,\nat 209, 221\u2013222.

Williams,\n553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute\nis vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for \u201c[a]\nplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly\nproscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as\napplied to the conduct of others.\u201d Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).\nWe have said that when a statute \u201cinterferes with the\nright of free speech or of association, a more stringent\nvagueness test should apply.\u201d Id., at 499. \u201cBut \u2018perfect\nclarity and precise guidance have never been required\neven of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\u2019 \u201d\nWilliams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).\n   The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.\nInstead, the lower court merged plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness\nchallenge with their First Amendment claims, holding\nthat portions of the material-support statute were uncon\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nknows or intends that those activities will assist the organization\u2019s\nunlawful terrorist actions.\u201d Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord\u00ad\ning to the dissent, this interpretation is \u201cfairly possible\u201d and adopting it\nwould avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72339B fails for essentially the\nsame reasons as plaintiffs\u2019. Congress explained what \u201cknowingly\u201d\nmeans in \u00a72339B, and it did not choose the dissent\u2019s interpretation of\nthat term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement\nindistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in \u00a7\u00a72339A and\n2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in\n\u00a72339B.\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutionally vague because they applied to protected\nspeech\u2014regardless of whether those applications were\nclear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary\nintelligence understood the scope of the term \u201ctraining,\u201d\nthat term would \u201cremai[n] impermissibly vague\u201d because\nit could \u201cbe read to encompass speech and advocacy pro\u00ad\ntected by the First Amendment.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 929. It also\nfound \u201cservice\u201d and a portion of \u201cexpert advice or assis\u00ad\ntance\u201d to be vague because those terms covered protected\nspeech. Id., at 929\u2013930.\n   Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not\naddressing a \u201cfacial vagueness challenge,\u201d id., at 929, n. 6,\nthe Court of Appeals considered the statute\u2019s application\nto facts not before it. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied\non the Government\u2019s statement that \u00a72339B would bar\nfiling an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist\norganization\u2014which plaintiffs have not told us they wish\nto do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs\nwished to do\u2014to conclude that the statute barred pro\u00ad\ntected advocacy and was therefore vague. See id., at 930.\nBy deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical cir\u00ad\ncumstances, the Court of Appeals\u2019 discussion of vagueness\nseemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment\noverbreadth doctrine. See id., at 929\u2013930 (finding it \u201ceasy\nto imagine\u201d protected expression that would be barred by\n\u00a72339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 930\n(referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).\n   In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contra\u00ad\nvened the rule that \u201c[a] plaintiff who engages in some\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the\nvagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d\nHoffman Estates, supra, at 495. That rule makes no ex\u00ad\nception for conduct in the form of speech. See Parker v.\nLevy, 417 U. S. 733, 755\u2013757 (1974). Thus, even to the\nextent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plain\u00ad\ntiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a suc\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncessful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly\ncannot do so based on the speech of others. Such a plain\u00ad\ntiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First\nAmendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth\nAmendment vagueness challenge does not turn on\nwhether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected\nexpression. See Williams, supra, at 304; Hoffman Estates,\nsupra, at 494\u2013495, 497. Otherwise the doctrines would be\nsubstantially redundant.\n   Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs\u2019 claims of vagueness\nlack merit. Plaintiffs do not argue that the material\u00ad\nsupport statute grants too much enforcement discretion to\nthe Government. We therefore address only whether the\nstatute \u201cprovide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited.\u201d Williams, 553 U. S., at 304.\n   As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here\nare quite different from the sorts of terms that we have\npreviously declared to be vague. We have in the past\n\u201cstruck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to\nwhether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u2018annoying\u2019 or \u2018inde\u00ad\ncent\u2019\u2014wholly subjective judgments without statutory\ndefinitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\u201d\nId., at 306; see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S.\n156, n. 1 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that pun\u00ad\nished \u201cvagrants,\u201d defined to include \u201crogues and vaga\u00ad\nbonds,\u201d \u201cpersons who use juggling,\u201d and \u201ccommon night\nwalkers\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying\nthe statutory terms in this action\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert\nadvice or assistance,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014does not\nrequire similarly untethered, subjective judgments.\n   Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to\nthe material-support statute over time. These definitions\nincreased the clarity of the statute\u2019s terms.            See\n\u00a72339A(b)(2) (\u201c \u2018training\u2019 means instruction or teaching\ndesigned to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge\u201d); \u00a72339A(b)(3) (\u201c \u2018expert advice or assistance\u2019\nmeans advice or assistance derived from scientific, techni\u00ad\ncal or other specialized knowledge\u201d); \u00a72339B(h) (clarifying\nthe scope of \u201cpersonnel\u201d). And the knowledge requirement\nof the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,\nas we have held with respect to other statutes containing a\nsimilar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,\n732 (2000); Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511\nU. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455\nU. S., at 499.\n   Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may\nnot be clear in every application. But the dispositive point\nhere is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica\u00ad\ntion to plaintiffs\u2019 proposed conduct, which means that\nplaintiffs\u2019 vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming\nthat a heightened standard applies because the material\u00ad\nsupport statute potentially implicates speech, the statu\u00ad\ntory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114\u2013115 (1972)\n(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that\nimplicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,\nat 223 (same).\n   Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage\nreadily fall within the scope of the terms \u201ctraining\u201d and\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance.\u201d Plaintiffs want to \u201ctrain\nmembers of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and\ninternational law to peacefully resolve disputes,\u201d and\n\u201cteach PKK members how to petition various representa\u00ad\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\u201d 552\nF. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would\nunderstand that instruction on resolving disputes through\ninternational law falls within the statute\u2019s definition of\n\u201ctraining\u201d because it imparts a \u201cspecific skill,\u201d not \u201cgeneral\nknowledge.\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs\u2019 activities also fall\ncomfortably within the scope of \u201cexpert advice or assis\u00ad\ntance\u201d: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In fact,\nplaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms\n\u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert advice\u201d throughout this litigation to\ndescribe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that\nthese common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs\u2019\nconduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,\n59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.\n   Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations\ndesigned to test the limits of \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert advice\nor assistance.\u201d They argue that the statutory definitions\nof these terms use words of degree\u2014like \u201cspecific,\u201d \u201cgen\u00ad\neral,\u201d and \u201cspecialized\u201d\u2014and that it is difficult to apply\nthose definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain\u00ad\ntiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography\nwould constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen\ntile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we\nfound vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a\ncriminal case, when speaking to the press, \u201cmay state\nwithout elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .\ndefense.\u201d Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Whatever force these arguments might have in the\nabstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not\npropose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek\nrefuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary\nbetween \u201cspecific skills\u201d and \u201cgeneral knowledge.\u201d See\nParker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this\npoint in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo\u00ad\nretical doubts regarding the distinction between \u201cactive\u201d\nand \u201cnominal\u201d membership in an organization\u2014also terms\nof degree\u2014the defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge failed\nbecause his \u201ccase present[ed] no such problem.\u201d 367 U. S.,\nat 223.\n   Gentile was different. There the asserted vagueness in\na state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Court: Counsel had reason to suppose that his particu\u00ad\nlar statements to the press would not violate the rule, yet\nhe was disciplined nonetheless. See 501 U. S., at 1049\u2013\n1051. We did not suggest that counsel could escape disci\u00ad\npline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly\nprohibited.\n   Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in\n\u201cpolitical advocacy\u201d on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey\nand Tamils living in Sri Lanka. 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nThey are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded\nas \u201cmaterial support\u201d in the form of providing \u201cpersonnel\u201d\nor \u201cservice[s],\u201d and assert that the statute is unconstitu\u00ad\ntionally vague because they cannot tell.\n   As for \u201cpersonnel,\u201d Congress enacted a limiting defini\u00ad\ntion in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness concerns.\nProviding material support that constitutes \u201cpersonnel\u201d is\ndefined as knowingly providing a person \u201cto work under\nthat terrorist organization\u2019s direction or control or to\norganize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the op\u00ad\neration of that organization.\u201d \u00a72339B(h). The statute\nmakes clear that \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not cover independent\nadvocacy: \u201cIndividuals who act entirely independently of\nthe foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or\nobjectives shall not be considered to be working under the\nforeign terrorist organization\u2019s direction and control.\u201d\nIbid.\n   \u201c[S]ervice\u201d similarly refers to concerted activity, not\nindependent advocacy. See Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining \u201cservice\u201d to mean\n\u201cthe performance of work commanded or paid for by an\u00ad\nother: a servant\u2019s duty: attendance on a superior\u201d; or \u201can\nact done for the benefit or at the command of another\u201d).\nContext confirms that ordinary meaning here. The statute\nprohibits providing a service \u201cto a foreign terrorist organi\u00ad\nzation.\u201d \u00a72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). The use of the\nword \u201cto\u201d indicates a connection between the service and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe foreign group. We think a person of ordinary intelli\u00ad\ngence would understand that independently advocating for\na cause is different from providing a service to a group\nthat is advocating for that cause.\n   Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terror\u00ad\nist group could be characterized as a \u201cservice,\u201d the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s specific exclusion of independent activity in the\ndefinition of \u201cpersonnel\u201d would not make sense. Congress\nwould not have prohibited under \u201cservice\u201d what it specifi\u00ad\ncally exempted from prohibition under \u201cpersonnel.\u201d The\nother types of material support listed in the statute, in\u00ad\ncluding \u201clodging,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cexplosives,\u201d and \u201ctranspor\u00ad\ntation,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could\nbe provided independently of a foreign terrorist organiza\u00ad\ntion. We interpret \u201cservice\u201d along the same lines. Thus,\nany independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to\nengage is not prohibited by \u00a72339B. On the other hand, a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would understand the term\n\u201cservice\u201d to cover advocacy performed in coordination with,\nor at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.\n   Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute\nposes difficult questions of exactly how much direction or\ncoordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a\n\u201cservice.\u201d See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09\u201389,\np. 14 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (\u201cWould any\ncommunication with any member be sufficient? With a\nleader? Must the \u2018relationship\u2019 have any formal elements,\nsuch as an employment or contractual relationship? What\nabout a relationship through an intermediary?\u201d). The\nproblem with these questions is that they are entirely\nhypothetical. Plaintiffs have not provided any specific\narticulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate\ntheir advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE. They have\ninstead described the form of their intended advocacy only\nin the most general terms. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs\n10\u201311 (plaintiffs \u201cwould like, among other things, to offer\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the\nKurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations\nand the United States Congress\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would\nlike to \u201cwrite and distribute publications supportive of the\nPKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation\u201d and \u201cadvocate\nfor the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey\u201d).\n   Deciding whether activities described at such a level of\ngenerality would constitute prohibited \u201cservice[s]\u201d under\nthe statute would require \u201csheer speculation\u201d\u2014which\nmeans that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforce\u00ad\nment challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Wash\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454 (2008).\nIt is apparent with respect to these claims that \u201cgrada\u00ad\ntions of fact or charge would make a difference as to\ncriminal liability,\u201d and so \u201cadjudication of the reach and\nconstitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact\nsituation.\u201d Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.

Both plaintiffs and\nthe Government take extreme positions on this question.\nPlaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their \u201cpure\npolitical speech.\u201d E.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43. It has\nnot. Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may\nsay anything they wish on any topic. They may speak and\nwrite freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of\nTurkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international\nlaw. They may advocate before the United Nations. As\nthe Government states: \u201cThe statute does not prohibit\nindependent advocacy or expression of any kind.\u201d Brief for\nGovernment 13. Section 2339B also \u201cdoes not prevent\n[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nor impose any sanction on them for doing so.\u201d Id., at 60.\nCongress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or\nopinions in the form of \u201cpure political speech.\u201d Rather,\nCongress has prohibited \u201cmaterial support,\u201d which most\noften does not take the form of speech at all. And when it\ndoes, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\ncategory of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordi\u00ad\nnation with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be\nterrorist organizations.4\n   For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far,\nclaiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation\nis conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is directed at the\nfact of plaintiffs\u2019 interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the\nGovernment contends, and only incidentally burdens their\nexpression. The Government argues that the proper\nstandard of review is therefore the one set out in United\nStates v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). In that case, the\nCourt rejected a First Amendment challenge to a convic\u00ad\ntion under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying\ndraft cards, even though O\u2019Brien had burned his card in\nprotest against the draft. See id., at 370, 376, 382. In so\ndoing, we applied what we have since called \u201cintermediate\nscrutiny,\u201d under which a \u201ccontent-neutral regulation will\nbe sustained under the First Amendment if it advances\nimportant governmental interests unrelated to the sup\u00ad\npression of free speech and does not burden substantially\nmore speech than necessary to further those interests.\u201d\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180,\n189 (1997) (citing O\u2019Brien, supra, at 377).\n   The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent also analyzes the statute as if it prohibited \u201c[p]eaceful\n\npolitical advocacy\u201d or \u201cpure speech and association,\u201d without more.\nPost, at 9, 17. Section 2339B does not do that, and we do not address\nthe constitutionality of any such prohibitions. The dissent\u2019s claim that\nour decision is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s cases analyzing those\nsorts of restrictions, post, at 11\u201312, is accordingly unfounded.\n22         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nissue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to\nargue that O\u2019Brien provides the correct standard of re\u00ad\nview.5 O\u2019Brien does not provide the applicable standard\nfor reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385\u2013386 (1992); Texas\nv. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406\u2013407 (1989), and\n\u00a72339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain\u00ad\ntiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether\nthey may do so under \u00a72339B depends on what they say.\nIf plaintiffs\u2019 speech to those groups imparts a \u201cspecific\nskill\u201d or communicates advice derived from \u201cspecialized\nknowledge\u201d\u2014for example, training on the use of interna\u00ad\ntional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations\u2014\nthen it is barred. See Brief for Government 33\u201334. On the\nother hand, plaintiffs\u2019 speech is not barred if it imparts\nonly general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.\n   The Government argues that \u00a72339B should nonethe\u00ad\nless receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally\nfunctions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs\nheadlong into a number of our precedents, most promi\u00ad\nnently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen\nalso involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,\nbarring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when\nCohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an\nepithet, we did not apply O\u2019Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.\nInstead, we recognized that the generally applicable law\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs\u2019\nactivities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the\nFirst Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi\u00ad\nnated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,\nlike the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;\nReply Brief for Government 31\u201332, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.\nEmpire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not\nconsider any such argument because the Government does not develop\nit: The Government\u2019s submission is that applying \u00a72339B to plaintiffs\ntriggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny\u2014not that it triggers\nno First Amendment scrutiny at all.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu\u00ad\nnicated\u2014he violated the breach of the peace statute be\u00ad\ncause of the offensive content of his particular message.\nWe accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re\u00ad\nversed his conviction. See id., at 18\u201319, 26.\n   This suit falls into the same category. The law here\nmay be described as directed at conduct, as the law in\nCohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap\u00ad\nplied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under\nthe statute consists of communicating a message. As we\nexplained in Texas v. Johnson: \u201cIf the [Government\u2019s]\nregulation is not related to expression, then the less strin\u00ad\ngent standard we announced in United States v. O\u2019Brien\nfor regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If\nit is, then we are outside of O\u2019Brien\u2019s test, and we must\n[apply] a more demanding standard.\u201d 491 U. S., at 403\n(citation omitted).\n                              B\n   The First Amendment issue before us is more refined\nthan either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It\nis not whether the Government may prohibit pure political\nspeech, or may prohibit material support in the form of\nconduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro\u00ad\nhibit what plaintiffs want to do\u2014provide material support\nto the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.\n   Everyone agrees that the Government\u2019s interest in\ncombating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest\norder. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is\nthat the ban on material support, applied to what they\nwish to do, is not \u201cnecessary to further that interest.\u201d\nIbid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify\nprohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their\nsupport will advance only the legitimate activities of the\ndesignated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.\nId., at 51\u201352.\n24        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\nsegregate support of their legitimate activities from sup\u00ad\nport of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en\u00ad\nacted \u00a72339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings\nregarding the serious threat posed by international terror\u00ad\nism. See AEDPA \u00a7\u00a7301(a)(1)\u2013(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339B (Findings and Purpose). One\nof those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs\u2019 contention\nthat their support would not further the terrorist activities\nof the PKK and LTTE: \u201c[F]oreign organizations that en\u00ad\ngage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\nconduct that any contribution to such an organization\nfacilitates that conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a)(7) (emphasis added).\n   Plaintiffs argue that the reference to \u201cany contribution\u201d\nin this finding meant only monetary support. There is no\nreason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly\nbecause Congress expressly prohibited so much more than\nmonetary support in \u00a72339B. Congress\u2019s use of the term\n\u201ccontribution\u201d is best read to reflect a determination that\nany form of material support furnished \u201cto\u201d a foreign\nterrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely\nwhat the material-support statute does. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted \u00a72339B, Congress simultaneously re\u00ad\nmoved an exception that had existed in \u00a72339A(a) (1994\ned.) for the provision of material support in the form of\n\u201chumanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved\nin\u201d terrorist activity. AEDPA \u00a7323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205\nF. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful\naid would have no harmful effects.\n   We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject\u00ad\ning that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.\n\u201cThe PKK\u2019s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000\nlives.\u201d Declaration of Kenneth R.

It is not difficult to conclude as Con\u00ad\ngress did that the \u201ctain[t]\u201d of such violent activities is so\ngreat that working in coordination with or at the com\u00ad\nmand of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and\nfurther their terrorist means.

Such support frees up\nother resources within the organization that may be put to\nviolent ends. It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to\nforeign terrorist groups\u2014legitimacy that makes it easier\nfor those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to\nraise funds\u2014all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.\n\u201cTerrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\n\u2018firewalls\u2019 that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and\ncommingling of support and benefits.\u201d McKune Affidavit,\nApp. 135, \u00b611. \u201c[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror\u00ad\nist groups systematically conceal their activities behind\ncharitable, social, and political fronts.\u201d M.

Post, at 8\u20139. This contention\nmisses the point. Both common sense and the evidence submitted by\nthe Government make clear that material support of a terrorist group\u2019s\nlawful activities facilitates the group\u2019s ability to attract \u201cfunds,\u201d \u201cfi\u00ad\nnancing,\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d that will further its terrorist acts.

Brief for Government 6; App. 128.\nThat nation and our other allies would react sharply to\nAmericans furnishing material support to foreign groups\nlike the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the expla\u00ad\nnation that the support was meant only to further those\ngroups\u2019 \u201clegitimate\u201d activities. From Turkey\u2019s perspective,\nthere likely are no such activities. See 352 F. 3d, at 389\n(observing that Turkey prohibits membership in the PKK\nand prosecutes those who provide support to that group,\nregardless of whether the support is directed to lawful\nactivities).\n                              C\n  In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distin\u00ad\nguish material support for a foreign terrorist group\u2019s\nviolent activities and its nonviolent activities, we do not\nrely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the\nrecord evidence. We have before us an affidavit stating\nthe Executive Branch\u2019s conclusion on that question. The\nState Department informs us that \u201c[t]he experience and\nanalysis of the U. S. government agencies charged with\ncombating terrorism strongly suppor[t]\u201d Congress\u2019s finding\nthat all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations\nfurther their terrorism.

In the Executive\u2019s view: \u201cGiven the purposes,\norganizational structure, and clandestine nature of foreign\nterrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any mate\u00ad\nrial support to these organizations will ultimately inure to\nthe benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\u2014\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly in\u00ad\ntended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities.\u201d\nMcKune Affidavit, App. 133, \u00b68.\n  That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Con\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This litigation\nimplicates sensitive and weighty interests of national\nsecurity and foreign affairs. The PKK and the LTTE have\ncommitted terrorist acts against American citizens abroad,\nand the material-support statute addresses acute foreign\npolicy concerns involving relationships with our Nation\u2019s\nallies. See id., at 128\u2013133, 137. We have noted that \u201cnei\u00ad\nther the Members of this Court nor most federal judges\nbegin the day with briefings that may describe new and\nserious threats to our Nation and its people.\u201d Boumediene\nv. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 797 (2008). It is vital in this con\u00ad\ntext \u201cnot to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence\nfor a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.\u201d\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 68 (1981). See Wald,\n468 U. S., at 242; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981).\n   Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns\nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant\nabdication of the judicial role. We do not defer to the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of the First Amendment, even when\nsuch interests are at stake. We are one with the dissent\nthat the Government\u2019s \u201cauthority and expertise in these\nmatters do not automatically trump the Court\u2019s own obli\u00ad\ngation to secure the protection that the Constitution\ngrants to individuals.\u201d Post, at 23. But when it comes to\ncollecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this\narea, \u201cthe lack of competence on the part of the courts is\nmarked,\u201d Rostker, supra, at 65, and respect for the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s conclusions is appropriate.\n   One reason for that respect is that national security and\nforeign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to\nconfront evolving threats in an area where information\ncan be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct\ndifficult to assess. The dissent slights these real con\u00ad\nstraints in demanding hard proof\u2014with \u201cdetail,\u201d \u201cspecific\nfacts,\u201d and \u201cspecific evidence\u201d\u2014that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed\nactivities will support terrorist attacks. See post, at 9, 16,\n30        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23. That would be a dangerous requirement. In this\ncontext, conclusions must often be based on informed\njudgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality\naffects what we may reasonably insist on from the Gov\u00ad\nernment. The material-support statute is, on its face, a\npreventive measure\u2014it criminalizes not terrorist attacks\nthemselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to\noccur. The Government, when seeking to prevent immi\u00ad\nnent harms in the context of international affairs and\nnational security, is not required to conclusively link all\nthe pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its\nempirical conclusions. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S., at 17\n(\u201c[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of\ncontemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . .\nmust of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it\ncustomarily wields in domestic areas\u201d).\n   This context is different from that in decisions like\nCohen. In that case, the application of the statute turned\non the offensiveness of the speech at issue. Observing that\n\u201cone man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric,\u201d we invalidated\nCohen\u2019s conviction in part because we concluded that\n\u201cgovernmental officials cannot make principled distinc\u00ad\ntions in this area.\u201d 403 U. S., at 25. In this litigation, by\ncontrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely posi\u00ad\ntioned to make principled distinctions between activities\nthat will further terrorist conduct and undermine United\nStates foreign policy, and those that will not.\n   We also find it significant that Congress has been con\u00ad\nscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions\nmay implicate constitutional concerns. First, \u00a72339B only\napplies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nThere is, and always has been, a limited number of those\norganizations designated by the Executive Branch, see,\ne.g., 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997),\nand any groups so designated may seek judicial review of\nthe designation. Second, in response to the lower courts\u2019\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nholdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the\nstatute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms\n\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cpersonnel,\u201d and \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d\nas well as an explanation of the knowledge required to\nviolate \u00a72339B. Third, in effectuating its stated intent not\nto abridge First Amendment rights, see \u00a72339B(i), Con\u00ad\ngress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in\ncreating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.\nThe definition of material support, for example, excludes\nmedicine and religious materials. See \u00a72339A(b)(1). In\nthis area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature\u2019s\nsuperior capacity for weighing competing interests means\nthat \u201cwe must be particularly careful not to substitute our\njudgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.\u201d Rost\nker, supra, at 68. Finally, and most importantly, Congress\nhas avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or\nindeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or\ncontrolled by foreign terrorist groups.\n  At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the consid\u00ad\nered judgment of Congress and the Executive that provid\u00ad\ning material support to a designated foreign terrorist\norganization\u2014even seemingly benign support\u2014bolsters\nthe terrorist activities of that organization. That judg\u00ad\nment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we\nhave persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given\nthe sensitive interests in national security and foreign\naffairs at stake, the political branches have adequately\nsubstantiated their determination that, to serve the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s interest in preventing terrorism, it was neces\u00ad\nsary to prohibit providing material support in the form of\ntraining, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign\nterrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote\nonly the groups\u2019 nonviolent ends.\n  We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to\nundertake. First, plaintiffs propose to \u201ctrain members of\n[the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international\n32        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to peacefully resolve disputes.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nCongress can, consistent with the First Amendment,\nprohibit this direct training. It is wholly foreseeable that\nthe PKK could use the \u201cspecific skill[s]\u201d that plaintiffs\npropose to impart, \u00a72339A(b)(2), as part of a broader\nstrategy to promote terrorism. The PKK could, for exam\u00ad\nple, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time\nto recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into\ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed at\u00ad\ntacks. See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The\nPKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286\u2013295\n(2007) (describing the PKK\u2019s suspension of armed struggle\nand subsequent return to violence). A foreign terrorist\norganization introduced to the structures of the interna\u00ad\ntional legal system might use the information to threaten,\nmanipulate, and disrupt. This possibility is real, not\nremote.\n   Second, plaintiffs propose to \u201cteach PKK members how\nto petition various representative bodies such as the\nUnited Nations for relief.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. The\nGovernment acts within First Amendment strictures in\nbanning this proposed speech because it teaches the or\u00ad\nganization how to acquire \u201crelief,\u201d which plaintiffs never\ndefine with any specificity, and which could readily in\u00ad\nclude monetary aid. See Brief for Plaintiffs 10\u201311, 16\u201317,\nn. 10; App. 58\u201359, 80\u201381. Indeed, earlier in this litigation,\nplaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE \u201cto present claims for\ntsunami-related aid to mediators and international bod\u00ad\nies,\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1, which naturally included\nmonetary relief. Money is fungible, supra, at 26, and\nCongress logically concluded that money a terrorist group\nsuch as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs\npropose to teach could be redirected to funding the group\u2019s\nviolent activities.\n   Finally, plaintiffs propose to \u201cengage in political advo\u00ad\ncacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,\u201d and \u201cengage\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

As explained above, su\npra, at 19\u201320, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level\nof coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what\nexactly their \u201cadvocacy\u201d would consist of. Plaintiffs\u2019 pro\u00ad\nposals are phrased at such a high level of generality that\nthey cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge. See\nsupra, at 20; Grange, 552 U. S., at 454; Zemel, 381 U. S.,\nat 20.\n   In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to ad\u00ad\ndress the real dangers at stake. It instead considers only\nthe possible benefits of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed activities in the\nabstract. See post, at 13\u201315. The dissent seems unwilling\nto entertain the prospect that training and advising a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization on how to take\nadvantage of international entities might benefit that\norganization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activi\u00ad\nties. In the dissent\u2019s world, such training is all to the\ngood. Congress and the Executive, however, have con\u00ad\ncluded that we live in a different world: one in which the\ndesignated foreign terrorist organizations \u201care so tainted\nby their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.\u201d AEDPA \u00a7301(a)(7).\nOne in which, for example, \u201cthe United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish\nrefugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come\nunder the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to\nrespect its \u2018neutral and humanitarian nature.\u2019 \u201d McKune\nAffidavit, App. 135\u2013136, \u00b613. Training and advice on how\nto work with the United Nations could readily have helped\nthe PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a\nbase for terrorist activities.\n   If only good can come from training our adversaries in\ninternational dispute resolution, presumably it would\nhave been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens\nfrom training the Japanese Government on using interna\u00ad\n34        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes\nduring World War II. It would, under the dissent\u2019s rea\u00ad\nsoning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving\ndisputes through \u201c \u2018deliberative forces,\u2019 \u201d post, at 13 (quot\u00ad\ning Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that\nassisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort\nmore generally. That view is not one the First Amend\u00ad\nment requires us to embrace.\n   All this is not to say that any future applications of the\nmaterial-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur\u00ad\nvive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that\nany other statute relating to speech and terrorism would\nsatisfy the First Amendment. In particular, we in no way\nsuggest that a regulation of independent speech would\npass constitutional muster, even if the Government were\nto show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organi\u00ad\nzations. We also do not suggest that Congress could ex\u00ad\ntend the same prohibition on material support at issue\nhere to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in\nprohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs\nseek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, \u00a72339B does\nnot violate the freedom of speech.\n                              VI\n  Plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the material-support stat\u00ad\nute violates their freedom of association under the First\nAmendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminal\u00ad\nizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and\nthe LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De\nJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which\nwe have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist\nParty, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\nState of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,\n389 U. S. 258 (1967).\n  The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause the statute does not penalize mere association with\na foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put\nit: \u201cThe statute does not prohibit being a member of one of\nthe designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup\u00ad\nporting the political goals of the group. . . . What [\u00a72339B]\nprohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .\u201d 205\nF. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci\u00ad\nsions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as\u00ad\nsembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at\n262 (\u201cIt is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis\u00ad\ncriminately across all types of association with Commu\u00ad\nnist-action groups, without regard to the quality and\ndegree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First\nAmendment\u201d); De Jonge, supra, at 362.\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute\nburdens their freedom of association because it prevents\nthem from providing support to designated foreign terror\u00ad\nist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for\nPlaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37\u201338. Any burden\non plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of association in this regard is justi\u00ad\nfied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs\u2019\nfree speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu\u00ad\ntion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of\nspeech that constitute material support, but did not per\u00ad\nmit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly\ndangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is\nnot required to ban material support to every group or\nnone at all.\n                        *   *    *\n  The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the\npeople of the United States ordained and established that\ncharter of government in part to \u201cprovide for the common\ndefence.\u201d As Madison explained, \u201c[s]ecurity against for\u00ad\neign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the\nAmerican Union.\u201d The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J.

We hold that, in regulating the particular forms\nof support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror\u00ad\nist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective\nconsistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth\nAmendments.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con\u00ad\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the Constitution permits the Government to prose\ncute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated\nteaching and advocacy furthering the designated organiza\ntions\u2019 lawful political objectives. In my view, the Govern\nment has not met its burden of showing that an interpre\ntation of the statute that would prohibit this speech- and\nassociation-related activity serves the Government\u2019s com\npelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would\ninterpret the statute as normally placing activity of this\nkind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

All these ac\ntivities are of a kind that the First Amendment ordinarily\nprotects.\n   In my view, the Government has not made the strong\nshowing necessary to justify under the First Amendment\nthe criminal prosecution of those who engage in these\nactivities. All the activities involve the communication\nand advocacy of political ideas and lawful means of achiev\ning political ends. Even the subjects the plaintiffs wish to\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Thus, there is\nno general First Amendment exception that applies here.\nIf the statute is constitutional in this context, it would\nhave to come with a strong justification attached.\n  It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the\nconstitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs\u2019\nproposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme\ndiate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,\nbut \u201c \u2018a more demanding standard.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 23 (quoting\nTexas v.

First, the Government says that the plaintiffs\u2019 sup\nport for these organizations is \u201cfungible\u201d in the same sense\nas other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the\nplaintiffs\u2019 support could, for example, free up other re\nsources, which the organization might put to terrorist\nends. Brief for Respondents in No. 09\u201389, pp. 54\u201356 (here\ninafter Government Brief).\n   The proposition that the two very different kinds of\n\u201csupport\u201d are \u201cfungible,\u201d however, is not obviously true.\nThere is no obvious way in which undertaking advocacy\nfor political change through peaceful means or teaching\nthe PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Na\ntions for political change is fungible with other resources\nthat might be put to more sinister ends in the way that\ndonations of money, food, or computer training are fungi\nble. It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities\ncan themselves be redirected, or will free other resources\nthat can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we\nmust determine whether the Government has come for\nward with evidence to support its claim.\n   The Government has provided us with no empirical\ninformation that might convincingly support this claim.\nInstead, the Government cites only to evidence that Con\ngress was concerned about the \u201cfungible\u201d nature in general\nof resources, predominately money and material goods. It\npoints to a congressional finding that \u201cforeign organiza\ntions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by\ntheir criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247, note following 18 U.

McKune, App. 134,\n136 (emphasis added).\n   The most one can say in the Government\u2019s favor about\nthese statements is that they might be read as offering\nhighly general support for its argument. The statements\ndo not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs\u2019\npolitical-advocacy-related activities might actually be\n\u201cfungible\u201d and therefore capable of being diverted to ter\nrorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was\nconcerned with \u201csupport\u201d of this kind. The affidavit refers\nto \u201cfunds,\u201d \u201cfinancing,\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d\u2014none of which en\ncompasses the plaintiffs\u2019 activities. Ibid. The statutory\nstatement and the House Report use broad terms like\n\u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d that might be construed as\nencompassing the plaintiffs\u2019 activities. But in context,\nthose terms are more naturally understood as referring to\ncontributions of goods, money, or training and other ser\nvices (say, computer programming) that could be diverted\nto, or free funding for, terrorist ends. See infra, at 15\u201316.\nPeaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into\nthese categories. And the statute itself suggests that\nCongress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or\nassociation. See \u00a72339B(i) (\u201cNothing in this section shall\nbe construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of\nrights guaranteed under the First Amendment\u201d); see also\ninfra, at 18\u201319.\n   Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs\u2019 pro\nposed activities will \u201cbolste[r] a terrorist organization\u2019s\nefficacy and strength in a community\u201d and \u201cundermin[e]\nthis nation\u2019s efforts to delegitimize and weaken those\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngroups.\u201d Government Brief 56 (emphasis added). In the\nCourt\u2019s view, too, the Constitution permits application of\nthe statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because\nthose activities could provide a group that engages in\nterrorism with \u201clegitimacy.\u201d Ante, at 25. The Court sug\ngests that, armed with this greater \u201clegitimacy,\u201d these\norganizations will more readily be able to obtain material\nsupport of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban\u2014\nmoney, arms, lodging, and the like. See ibid.\n   Yet the Government does not claim that the statute\nforbids any speech \u201clegitimating\u201d a terrorist group.\nRather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership\nin terrorist organizations, (2) \u201cpeaceably assembling with\nmembers of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,\u201d or\n(3) \u201cindependent advocacy\u201d on behalf of these organiza\ntions. Government Brief 66, 61, 13. The Court, too, em\nphasizes that activities not \u201ccoordinated with\u201d the terror\nist groups are not banned. See ante, at 21, 26, 31\n(emphasis added). And it argues that speaking, writing,\nand teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization\u2019s\npeaceful political ends could \u201cmak[e] it easier for those\ngroups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.\u201d\nAnte, at 25.\n   But this \u201clegitimacy\u201d justification cannot by itself war\nrant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and asso\nciation. Speech, association, and related activities on\nbehalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to le\ngitimate that group. Thus, were the law to accept a \u201cle\ngitimating\u201d effect, in and of itself and without qualifica\ntion, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a\nban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold\ninstances where it should be won. Once one accepts this\nargument, there is no natural stopping place. The argu\nment applies as strongly to \u201cindependent\u201d as to \u201ccoordi\nnated\u201d advocacy. But see ante, at 26\u201327. That fact is\nreflected in part in the Government\u2019s claim that the ban\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

It is inordinately difficult to\ndistinguish when speech activity will and when it will not\ninitiate the chain of causation the Court suggests\u2014a chain\nthat leads from peaceful advocacy to \u201clegitimacy\u201d to in\ncreased support for the group to an increased supply of\nmaterial goods that support its terrorist activities. Even\nwere we to find some such line of distinction, its applica\ntion would seem so inherently uncertain that it would\noften, perhaps always, \u201cchill\u201d protected speech beyond its\nboundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply\nin abstract terms and without limitation, must always, or\nit will never, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plain\ntiffs\u2019 activities, \u201calways\u201d cannot possibly be the First\nAmendment\u2019s answer.\n   Regardless, the \u201clegitimacy\u201d justification itself is incon\nsistent with critically important First Amendment case\nlaw. Consider the cases involving the protection the First\nAmendment offered those who joined the Communist\nParty intending only to further its peaceful activities. In\nthose cases, this Court took account of congressional find\nings that the Communist Party not only advocated theo\nretically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow\nof our Government through force and violence. The Court\nhad previously accepted Congress\u2019 determinations that the\nAmerican Communist Party was a \u201cCommunist action\norganization\u201d which (1) acted under the \u201ccontrol, direction,\nand discipline\u201d of the world Communist movement, a\nmovement that sought to employ \u201cespionage, sabotage,\nterrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to\nestablish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,\u201d and (2)\n12        HOLDER v.

Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367\nU. S. 1, 5\u20136 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment\nprotected an American\u2019s right to belong to that party\u2014\ndespite whatever \u201clegitimating\u201d effect membership might\nhave had\u2014as long as the person did not share the party\u2019s\nunlawful purposes. See, e.g., De Jonge, 299 U. S. 353;\nScales, 367 U. S., at 228\u2013230; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384\nU. S. 11, 17 (1966); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.\nof State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605\u2013610 (1967); Robel, 389\nU. S. 258 (holding that national security interests did not\njustify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of\nCommunist-affiliated organizations working in any de\nfense-related facility). As I have pointed out, those cases\ndraw further support from other cases permitting pure\nadvocacy of even the most unlawful activity\u2014as long as\nthat advocacy is not \u201cdirected to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or produce\nsuch action.\u201d Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447. The Gov\nernment\u2019s \u201clegitimating\u201d theory would seem to apply to\nthese cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized,\nit would have led this Court to conclusions other than\nthose it reached.\n\n   Nor can the Government overcome these considerations\nsimply by narrowing the covered activities to those that\ninvolve coordinated, rather than independent, advocacy.\nConversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements\nmight well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related\nactivities here at issue (just as conversations and discus\nsions are a necessary part of membership in any organiza\ntion). The Government does not distinguish this kind of\n\u201ccoordination\u201d from any other. I am not aware of any form\nof words that might be used to describe \u201ccoordination\u201d that\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

And, as for the Government\u2019s willingness to distin\nguish independent advocacy from coordinated advocacy,\nthe former is more likely, not less likely, to confer legiti\nmacy than the latter. Thus, other things being equal, the\ndistinction \u201ccoordination\u201d makes is arbitrary in respect to\nfurthering the statute\u2019s purposes. And a rule of law that\nfinds the \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument adequate in respect to the\nlatter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute\nthat sought to attack the former.\n   Consider the majority\u2019s development of the Govern\nment\u2019s themes. First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs\u2019\nproposal to \u201c \u2018train members of [the] PKK on how to use\nhumanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve\ndisputes.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 31\u201332 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1).\nThe majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in\nsignificant part on the ground that \u201cpeaceful negotia\ntion[s]\u201d might just \u201cbu[y] time . . . , lulling opponents into\ncomplacency.\u201d Ante, at 32. And the PKK might use its\nnew information about \u201cthe structures of the international\nlegal system . . . to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\u201d\nIbid.\n   What is one to say about these arguments\u2014arguments\nthat would deny First Amendment protection to the peace\nful teaching of international human rights law on the\nground that a little knowledge about \u201cthe international\nlegal system\u201d is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent\u2019s\nsubsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so\nlet\u2019s not teach him how to try? What might be said of\nthese claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation com\nmitted to the resolution of disputes through \u201cdeliberative\nforces\u201d? Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n   In my own view, the majority\u2019s arguments stretch the\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconcept of \u201cfungibility\u201d beyond constitutional limits.\nNeither Congress nor the Government advanced these\nparticular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case\nin this Court\u2014not Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652\n(1925), not Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919),\nnot Abrams, 250 U. S. 616, not the later Communist Party\ncases decided during the heat of the Cold War\u2014in which\nthe Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or\nteaching might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating\ntime for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.\n    Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put\notherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is\nomnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more\nthan (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this\nkind of argument without more and to apply it to the\nteaching of a subject such as international human rights\nlaw is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitu\ntion\u2019s text and First Amendment precedent, would auto\nmatically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case\nwhere national security interests conflict with the First\nAmendment. The Constitution does not allow all such\nconflicts to be decided in the Government\u2019s favor.\n    The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its\narguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain\nfree to engage in the protected activity as long as it is not\n\u201ccoordinated.\u201d That is because there is no practical way to\norganize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about\nhuman rights law) without \u201ccoordination.\u201d Nor can the\nmajority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to\nsome special limiting circumstance present here. That is\nbecause the only evidence the majority offers to support its\ngeneral claim consists of a single reference to a book about\nterrorism, which the Government did not mention, and\nwhich apparently says no more than that at one time the\nPKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to\nit.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Second, the majority discusses the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal to\n\u201c \u2018teach PKK members how to petition various representa\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; emphasis added). The\nmajority\u2019s only argument with respect to this proposal is\nthat the relief obtained \u201ccould readily include monetary\naid,\u201d which the PKK might use to buy guns. Ante, at 32.\nThe majority misunderstands the word \u201crelief.\u201d In this\ncontext, as the record makes clear, the word \u201crelief\u201d does\nnot refer to \u201cmoney.\u201d It refers to recognition under the\nGeneva Conventions. See App. 57\u201358 (2003 Complaint);\nid., at 79\u201380 (1998 Complaint); id., at 113 (Fertig Declara\ntion); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs\u2019 counsel deny\ning that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in\nthe form of money).\n    Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would\ndefer strongly to Congress\u2019 \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d See, e.g.,\nante, at 30. But here, there is no evidence that Congress\nhas made such a judgment regarding the specific activities\nat issue in these cases. See infra, at 20\u201321. In any event,\n\u201cwhenever the fundamental rights of free speech and\nassembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain\nopen [for judicial determination] whether there actually\ndid exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if\nany, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended\nwas one so substantial as to justify the stringent restric\ntion interposed by the legislature.\u201d Whitney, supra, at\n378\u2013379 (Brandeis, J., concurring). In such circum\nstances, the \u201cjudicial function commands analysis of\nwhether the specific conduct charged falls within the\nreach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is\nconsonant with the Constitution.\u201d Landmark Communi\ncations, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 844 (1978). Hence,\na legislative declaration \u201cdoes not preclude enquiry into\nthe question whether, at the time and under the circum\nstances, the conditions existed which are essential to\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvalidity under the Federal Constitution.\u201d Whitney, supra,\nat 378; see also Landmark, supra, at 843 (\u201cDeference to a\nlegislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First\nAmendment rights are at stake\u201d).\n   I concede that the Government\u2019s expertise in foreign\naffairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters,\ne.g., our relations with Turkey. Cf. ante, at 27\u201328. But it\nremains for this Court to decide whether the Government\nhas shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing\nspeech activity otherwise protected by the First Amend\nment. And the fact that other nations may like us less for\ngranting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the\nday.\n   Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Govern\nment nor the majority points to any specific facts that\nshow that the speech-related activities before us are fun\ngible in some special way or confer some special legitimacy\nupon the PKK. Rather, their arguments in this respect\nare general and speculative. Those arguments would\napply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual\npurpose group\u2019s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether\nthe speech-related activity is coordinated). Both First\nAmendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent\nus from \u201csacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so\nspeculative a gain.\u201d Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.\nv.

Cro\nwell, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must\n\u201cascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly\npossible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d Ibid.; see\nalso Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346\u2013348 (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78\n(1994); United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401\n(1916).\n  I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti\ntutional problem is \u201cfairly possible.\u201d In particular, I would\nread the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment\nprotected pure speech and association only when the\ndefendant knows or intends that those activities will assist\nthe organization\u2019s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this\nreading, the Government would have to show, at a mini\nmum, that such defendants provided support that they\nknew was significantly likely to help the organization\npursue its unlawful terrorist aims.\n  A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is\naware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli\nhood that his or her conduct will materially support the\norganization\u2019s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,\n164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code\n\u00a72.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553\nU. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal\nCode \u00a72.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95\u2013605, pt. 1,\npp. 59\u201360 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite\nintent if it is his \u201cconscious objective\u201d (or purpose) to fur\nther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai\nley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code\n\u00a7\u00a72.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (\u201cWhen acting knowingly suffices\nto establish an element, such element also is established if\na person acts purposely\u201d). On the other hand, for the\nreasons I have set out, see supra, at 9\u201312, knowledge or\nintent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncould or would help further terrorism simply by helping to\nlegitimate the organization is not sufficient.\n   This reading of the statute protects those who engage in\npure speech and association ordinarily protected by the\nFirst Amendment. But it does not protect that activity\nwhere a defendant purposefully intends it to help terror\nism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds him\nself to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to\nassist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these catego\nries of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist\nends, the act of providing material support to a known\nterrorist organization bears a close enough relation to\nterrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited\nnotwithstanding any First Amendment interest.              Cf.\nBrandenburg, 395 U. S. 444. At the same time, this read\ning does not require the Government to undertake the\ndifficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and\nnonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred;\nknowledge is enough. See Bailey, supra, at 405 (defining\nspecific intent).\n   This reading is consistent with the statute\u2019s text. The\nstatute prohibits \u201cknowingly provid[ing] material support\nor resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\u00a72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). Normally we read a crimi\nnal statute as applying a mens rea requirement to all of\nthe subsequently listed elements of the crime. See Flores-\nFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6\u20137). So read, the defendant would have to know or\nintend (1) that he is providing support or resources, (2)\nthat he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist\norganization, and (3) that he is providing support that is\nmaterial, meaning (4) that his support bears a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization\u2019s terrorist ends.\n   This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201cmaterial.\u201d That word can mean being of a\nphysical or worldly nature, but it also can mean \u201cbeing of\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Here, it must\nmean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to\nphysical aid, would not apply to speech at all. See also\n\u00a72339A(b)(1) (defining \u201c \u2018material support or resources\u2019 \u201d as\n\u201cany property, tangible or intangible\u201d (emphasis added)).\nAnd if the statute applies only to support that would likely\nbe of real importance or great consequence, it must have\nimportance or consequence in respect to the organization\u2019s\nterrorist activities. That is because support that is not\nsignificantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes\nof this statute, neither has \u201cimportance\u201d nor is of \u201cgreat\nconsequence.\u201d\n   The statutory definition of \u201cmaterial support\u201d poses no\nproblem. The statute defines \u201cmaterial support\u201d through\nreference to a list of terms, including those at issue here\u2014\n\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cpersonnel,\u201d and\n\u201cservice.\u201d \u00a72339B(g)(4); \u00a72339A(b)(1). Since these latter\nterms all fall under the definition of the term \u201cmaterial\nsupport,\u201d these activities fall within the statute\u2019s scope\nonly when they too are \u201cmaterial.\u201d Cf.

S.\n1, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from\nthe term to be defined)).\n   Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that\nthe defendant knew the support was material can be read\nto require the Government to show that the defendant\nknew that the consequences of his acts had a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization\u2019s terrorist, not\njust its lawful, aims.\n   I need not decide whether this is the only possible read\ning of the statute in cases where \u201cmaterial support\u201d takes\nthe form of \u201ccurrency,\u201d \u201cproperty,\u201d \u201cmonetary instru\nments,\u201d \u201cfinancial securities,\u201d \u201cfinancial services,\u201d \u201clodg\ning,\u201d \u201csafehouses,\u201d \u201cfalse documentation or identification,\u201d\n\u201cweapons,\u201d \u201clethal substances,\u201d or \u201cexplosives,\u201d and the\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlike. \u00a72339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more\nlikely to help an organization\u2019s terrorist activities, either\ndirectly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to\nshow that an individual has provided support of those\nkinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum\ning the statute\u2019s other requirements are met). But where\nsupport consists of pure speech or association, I would\nindulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government\nwould have to prove that the defendant knew he was\nproviding support significantly likely to help the organiza\ntion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,\nthat the defendant intended the support to be so used).\n   The statute\u2019s history strongly supports this reading.\nThat history makes clear that Congress primarily sought\nto end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations\nof money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104\u2013383, at\n38, 43\u201345, 81; supra, at 8\u20139. It shows that Congress,\nwhen referring to \u201cexpert services and assistance\u201d for\nexample, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi\nble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex\npert\u2019s giving \u201cadvice\u201d that \u201cfacilitat[es] an aircraft hijack\ning\u201d or an accountant\u2019s giving \u201cadvice\u201d that will \u201cfacilitate\nthe concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi\nties.\u201d Hearing on Administration\u2019s Draft Anti-Terrorism\nAct of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).\n   And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit\ntee, told the Senate:\n     \u201cThis bill also includes provisions making it a crime to\n     knowingly provide material support to the terrorist\n     functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden\n     tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.\u201d 142\n     Cong.

As Part II makes clear,\nthere is a \u201cserious\u201d doubt\u2014indeed, a \u201cgrave\u201d doubt\u2014about\nthe constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to\ncriminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at\n62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346\u2013348 (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there\nfore must \u201cread the statute to eliminate\u201d that constitu\ntional \u201cdoub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly\ncontrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U.

Our conse\nquent reading is consistent with the statute\u2019s text; it is\nconsistent with Congress\u2019 basic intent; it interprets but\ndoes not significantly add to what the statute otherwise\ncontains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo\ngraphs, 402 U.

I do not\nsee why the majority does not also remand the cases for\nconsideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 activities relating to \u201cadvo\ncating\u201d for the organizations\u2019 peaceful causes. See ante, at\n19\u201320, 32\u201333.\n   The majority does not remand, apparently because it\nbelieves the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these\n\u201cadvocacy\u201d claims are too general. It adds that the plain\ntiffs did not \u201csuggest what exactly their \u2018advocacy\u2019 would\nconsist of.\u201d Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about\nthe lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and\naffidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy\nthese groups have previously engaged in and in which\nthey would like to continue to engage. See App. 56\u201363,\n78\u201387, 95\u201399, 110\u2013123.\n   Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern\nment\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 speech-related activi\nties amount to \u201cconduct\u201d and should be reviewed as such.\nGovernment Brief 44\u201357. Hence, I should think the ma\njority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect\nof the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,\ne.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware\nand must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to\nthe Executive and Legislative Branches the power to\nprovide for the national defense, and that it grants par\nticular authority to the President in matters of foreign\naffairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that\nauthority and expertise in these matters do not automati\ncally trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the pro\ntection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (\u201cWe have\nlong since made clear that a state of war is not a blank\ncheck . . . when it comes to the rights of th[is] Nation\u2019s\ncitizens\u201d). In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I\nbelieve the Court has failed to examine the Government\u2019s\njustifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist\nupon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It\nhas failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling\nends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us\nof the protection that the First Amendment demands.\n   That is why, with respect, I dissent.\n",

Argued February 23, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010*\nIt is a federal crime to \u201cknowingly provid[e] material support or re\n  sources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339B(a)(1).\n  The authority to designate an entity a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d\n  rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.\n  \u201c[T]he term \u2018material support or resources\u2019 means any property, tan\n  gible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary in\n  struments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training,\n  expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or iden\n  tification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal sub\n  stances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or\n  include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious ma\n  terials.\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(1). Over the years, \u00a72339B and the definition of\n  \u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d have been amended, inter alia, to\n  clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group\u2019s des\n  ignation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts,\n  \u00a72339B(a)(1); and to define the terms \u201ctraining,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(2), \u201cex\n  pert advice or assistance,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(3), and \u201cpersonnel,\u201d \u00a72339B(h).\n     Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated \u201cforeign\n  terrorist organization[s]\u201d are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK)\n  and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to es\n  tablish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and\n  Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although both groups engage in political and\n  humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist\n  attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.

HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    they wish to support those groups\u2019 lawful, nonviolent activities, two\n    U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs)\n    initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support stat\n    ute. The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history. Ulti\n    mately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the\n    material-support statute against plaintiffs. After the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certio\n    rari. The Court granted both petitions.\n       As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge \u00a72339B\u2019s prohibi\n    tion on providing four types of material support\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert\n    advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014asserting violations\n    of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause on the ground that the\n    statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First\n    Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. They claim\n    that \u00a72339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging\n    in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use\n    international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK mem\n    bers to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies\n    for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living\n    in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.\nHeld: The material-support statute, \u00a72339B, is constitutional as applied\n to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to\n foreign terrorist organizations. Pp. 8\u201336.\n    (a) This preenforcement challenge to \u00a72339B is a justiciable Article\n III case or controversy. Plaintiffs face \u201ca credible threat of prosecu\n tion\u201d and \u201cshould not be required to await and undergo a criminal\n prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm\n Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. P. 10.\n    (b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga\n tion by accepting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the material-support stat\n ute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof\n that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization\u2019s\n illegal activities. That reading is inconsistent with \u00a72339B\u2019s text,\n which prohibits \u201cknowingly\u201d providing material support and demon\n strates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization\u2019s con\n nection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activi\n ties, as the necessary mental state for a violation. Plaintiffs\u2019 reading\n is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding\n \u00a72339B, which\u2014unlike \u00a72339B\u2014do refer to intent to further terrorist\n activity. See \u00a7\u00a72339A(a), 2339C(a)(1). Finally, there is no textual\n basis for plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the same language in \u00a72339B\n should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but\n not with regard to other forms of material support.

The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plain\ntiffs\u2019 vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, hold\ning that \u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and a portion of \u201cexpert advice or assis\ntance\u201d were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected\nspeech\u2014regardless of whether those applications were clear. The\nCourt of Appeals also contravened the rule that \u201c[a] plaintiff who en\ngages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of\nthe vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d Hoff\nman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.\n   The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, \u201cpro\nvide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohib\nited.\u201d United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304. The statutory\nterms at issue here\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cser\nvice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014are quite different from the sorts of terms,\nlike \u201c \u2018annoying\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018indecent,\u2019 \u201d that the Court has struck down for\nrequiring \u201cwholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,\nnarrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\u201d Id., at 306. Congress\nhas increased the clarity of \u00a72339B\u2019s terms by adding narrowing\ndefinitions, and \u00a72339B\u2019s knowledge requirement further reduces any\npotential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.\n   Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dis\npositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plain\ntiffs\u2019 proposed conduct. Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek\nto engage readily fall within the scope of \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert ad\nvice or assistance.\u201d In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly\nused those terms to describe their own proposed activities. Plaintiffs\u2019\nresort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of \u201ctraining\u201d and\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d is beside the point because this litiga\ntion does not concern such situations. See Scales v. United States,\n367 U. S. 203, 223. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030,\n1049\u20131051, distinguished. Plaintiffs\u2019 further contention, that the\nstatute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish\nto undertake, runs afoul of \u00a72339B(h), which makes clear that \u201cper\nsonnel\u201d does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independ\nently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cservice,\u201d which refers to concerted activity, not independent advo\ncacy. Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a\ncause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service \u201cto a\nforeign terrorist organization.\u201d \u00a72339B(a)(1).\n   Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage\nis not prohibited by \u00a72339B. On the other hand, a person of ordinary\nintelligence would understand the term \u201cservice\u201d to cover advocacy\nperformed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign ter\nrorist organization. Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the\n4             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or co\n    ordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a \u201cservice.\u201d Be\n    cause plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the de\n    gree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK\n    and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement\n    challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Repub\n    lican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454. Pp. 13\u201320.\n       (d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not\n    violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 20\u201334.\n         (1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on\n    this question. Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure\n    political speech. That claim is unfounded because, under the mate\n    rial-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.\n    Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or member\n    ship in the PKK and LTTE. Rather, Congress has prohibited \u201cmate\n    rial support,\u201d which most often does not take the form of speech. And\n    when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\n    category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with\n    foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.\n    On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only\n    thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the cor\n    rect standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United\n    States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377. That standard is not used to\n    review a content-based regulation of speech, and \u00a72339B regulates\n    plaintiffs\u2019 speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its con\n    tent. Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a\n    regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering\n    coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.\n    Thus, the Court \u201cmust [apply] a more demanding standard\u201d than the\n    one described in O\u2019Brien. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403. Pp.\n    20\u201323.\n         (2) The parties agree that the Government\u2019s interest in combat\n    ing terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs\n    argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech,\n    which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK\n    and LTTE. Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\n    segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terror\n    ism is an empirical question. Congress rejected plaintiffs\u2019 position on\n    that question when it enacted \u00a72339B, finding that \u201cforeign organiza\n    tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\n    conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that\n    conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following \u00a72339B. The record\n    confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 view. The\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nPKK and the LTTE are deadly groups. It is not difficult to conclude,\nas Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great\nthat working in coordination with them or at their command legiti\nmizes and furthers their terrorist means. Moreover, material sup\nport meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to\nadvance terrorism in multiple ways. The record shows that desig\nnated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\nfirewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or finan\ncial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and\nthose used to carry out terrorist attacks. Providing material support\nin any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to\nprevent terrorism and strain the United States\u2019 relationships with its\nallies, including those that are defending themselves against violent\ninsurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups. Pp. 23\u201328.\n     (3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual infer\nences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive\nBranch\u2019s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government\nagencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Con\ngress\u2019s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organiza\ntions\u2014even those for seemingly benign purposes\u2014further those\ngroups\u2019 terrorist activities. That evaluation of the facts, like Con\ngress\u2019s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive na\ntional security and foreign relations interests at stake. The Court\ndoes not defer to the Government\u2019s reading of the First Amendment.\nBut respect for the Government\u2019s factual conclusions is appropriate\nin light of the courts\u2019 lack of expertise with respect to national secu\nrity and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terror\nist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to ob\ntain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and\nconclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than\nconcrete evidence. The Court also finds it significant that Congress\nhas been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its ac\ntions may implicate constitutional concerns. Most importantly, Con\ngress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed\nany activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by for\neign terrorist groups. Given the sensitive interests in national secu\nrity and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have ade\nquately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material\nsupport in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services\nto foreign terrorist groups serves the Government\u2019s interest in pre\nventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to pro\nmote only the groups\u2019 nonviolent ends.\n   As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is\nwholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use in\n6             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in\n    formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat\n    egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\n    Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could\n    help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.\n    Plaintiffs\u2019 proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of\n    Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot\n    prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide\n    whether any future applications of the material-support statute to\n    speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply\n    holds that \u00a72339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied\n    to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.\n    28\u201334.\n         (e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs\u2019 First\n    Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute\n    criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the\n    LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court\u2019s precedents. The Ninth\n    Circuit correctly rejected this claim because \u00a72339B does not penalize\n    mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist\n    groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of asso\n    ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for\n    eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the\n    same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

In\nparticular, they claim that the statute is too vague, in\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment, and that it infringes\ntheir rights to freedom of speech and association, in viola\u00ad\ntion of the First Amendment. We conclude that the mate\u00ad\nrial-support statute is constitutional as applied to the\nparticular activities plaintiffs have told us they wish to\npursue.

Id., at 1184. Second, plain\u00ad\ntiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.\nId., at 1184\u20131185.\n   Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the\nDistrict Court granted in part. The District Court held\nthat plaintiffs had not established a probability of success\non their First Amendment speech and association claims.\nSee id., at 1196\u20131197. But the court held that plaintiffs\nhad established a probability of success on their claim\nthat, as applied to them, the statutory terms \u201cpersonnel\u201d\nand \u201ctraining\u201d in the definition of \u201cmaterial support\u201d were\nimpermissibly vague. See id., at 1204.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138\n(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 speech and\nassociation claims, including their claim that \u00a72339B\nviolated the First Amendment in barring them from con\u00ad\ntributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at\n1133\u20131136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that the terms \u201cpersonnel\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d\nwere vague because it was \u201ceasy to imagine protected\nexpression that falls within the bounds\u201d of those terms.\nId., at 1138; see id., at 1137.\n   With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the\naction returned to the District Court, and the parties\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits.

The court first rejected plaintiffs\u2019\nclaim that the material-support statute would violate due\nprocess unless it were read to require a specific intent to\nfurther the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee id., at 926\u2013927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the\nstatute was not overbroad in violation of the First\nAmendment. See id., at 931\u2013932. As for vagueness, the\nCourt of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a\n\u201cfacial vagueness challenge.\u201d Id., at 929, n. 6. The court\nheld that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms \u201ctraining,\u201d\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance\u201d (when derived from \u201cother\nspecialized knowledge\u201d), and \u201cservice\u201d were vague because\nthey \u201ccontinue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo\u00ad\ncacy,\u201d but the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d was not vague because it\n\u201cno longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment.\u201d Id., at 929\u2013931.\n   The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs\nfiled a conditional cross-petition.

Plaintiffs\nchallenge \u00a72339B\u2019s prohibition on four types of material\nsupport\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cser\u00ad\nvice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel.\u201d They raise three constitutional\nclaims. First, plaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B violates the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these\nfour statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B violates their freedom of\nspeech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs\nclaim that \u00a72339B violates their First Amendment free\u00ad\ndom of association.\n   Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in\nall their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that \u00a72339B\nis invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in\ncertain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16\u201317,\nn. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those\nactivities are: (1) \u201ctrain[ing] members of [the] PKK on how\nto use humanitarian and international law to peacefully\nresolve disputes\u201d; (2) \u201cengag[ing] in political advocacy on\nbehalf of Kurds who live in Turkey\u201d; and (3) \u201cteach[ing]\nPKK members how to petition various representative\nbodies such as the United Nations for relief.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at\n921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the\nother plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) \u201ctrain[ing] mem\u00ad\nbers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related\naid to mediators and international bodies\u201d; (2) \u201coffer[ing]\ntheir legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements\nbetween the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government\u201d; and\n(3) \u201cengag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils\nwho live in Sri Lanka.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1137.\n   Plaintiffs also state that \u201cthe LTTE was recently de\u00ad\nfeated militarily in Sri Lanka,\u201d so \u201c[m]uch of the support\nthe Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to\nprovide is now moot.\u201d Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain\u00ad\ntiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE \u201cas a political\norganization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of\nTamils.\u201d Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at\noral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the\nLTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,\nbecause the LTTE now \u201chas no role in Sri Lanka.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate\na peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwell. Thus, we do not consider the application of \u00a72339B\nto those activities here.\n   One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of\na criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must\nbe sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under\nArticle III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face \u201ca credi\u00ad\nble threat of prosecution\u201d and \u201cshould not be required to\nawait and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole\nmeans of seeking relief.\u201d Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442\nU. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.\n118, 128\u2013129 (2007).\n   Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK\nand the LTTE before the enactment of \u00a72339B and that\nthey would provide similar support again if the statute\u2019s\nallegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.         See 309\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has\ncharged about 150 persons with violating \u00a72339B, and\nthat several of those prosecutions involved the enforce\u00ad\nment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for\nGovernment 5. The Government has not argued to this\nCourt that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what\nthey say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\u201358. See\nBabbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop & Milav\netz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce\u00ad\nment challenge brought under the First Amendment).\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope\nafter 12 years of litigation).\n                            III\n  Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should\naffirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of\nconstitutional law. They contend that we should interpret\nthe material-support statute, when applied to speech, to\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire proof that a defendant intended to further a for\u00ad\neign terrorist organization\u2019s illegal activities. That inter\u00ad\npretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do\nnot intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the\nLTTE.\n   We reject plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a72339B because it\nis inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section\n2339B(a)(1) prohibits \u201cknowingly\u201d providing material\nsupport. It then specifically describes the type of knowl\u00ad\nedge that is required: \u201cTo violate this paragraph, a per\u00ad\nson must have knowledge that the organization is a\ndesignated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza\u00ad\ntion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or\nthat the organization has engaged or engages in terror\u00ad\nism. . . .\u201d Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary\nmental state for a violation of \u00a72339B, and it chose\nknowledge about the organization\u2019s connection to terror\u00ad\nism, not specific intent to further the organization\u2019s\nterrorist activities.\n   Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is also untenable in light of the\nsections immediately surrounding \u00a72339B, both of which\ndo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.           See\n\u00a72339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who\n\u201cprovides material support or resources . . . knowing or\nintending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in\ncarrying out, a violation of\u201d statutes prohibiting violent\nterrorist acts); \u00a72339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for\none who \u201cunlawfully and willfully provides or collects\nfunds with the intention that such funds be used, or with\nthe knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in\npart, in order to carry out\u201d other unlawful acts). Congress\nenacted \u00a72339A in 1994 and \u00a72339C in 2002.                  See\n\u00a7120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (\u00a72339A); \u00a7202(a), 116 Stat.\n724 (\u00a72339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent\nlanguage of those provisions into \u00a72339B, either when it\n12         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted \u00a72339B in 1996, or when it clarified \u00a72339B\u2019s\nknowledge requirement in 2004.\n   Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue\nthat a specific intent requirement should apply only when\nthe material-support statute applies to speech. There is\nno basis whatever in the text of \u00a72339B to read the same\nprovisions in that statute as requiring intent in some\ncircumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that\nplaintiffs are asking us not to interpret \u00a72339B, but to\nrevise it. \u201cAlthough this Court will often strain to con\u00ad\nstrue legislation so as to save it against constitutional\nattack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of\nperverting the purpose of a statute.\u201d Scales v. United\nStates, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).\n   Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,\nbut it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the\nSmith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo\u00ad\ncating the violent overthrow of the government. The\nCourt held that a person could not be convicted under the\nstatute unless he had knowledge of the group\u2019s illegal\nadvocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over\u00ad\nthrow. Id., at 220\u2013222, 229. This action is different:\nSection 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro\u00ad\nhibits providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to such a group. See\ninfra, at 20\u201321, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the\nneed for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The\nCourt in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text\nand precedent that had interpreted closely related provi\u00ad\nsions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U. S.,\nat 209, 221\u2013222. Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.\n   We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga\u00ad\ntion through plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretation of \u00a72339B.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent would interpret the statute along the same lines as the\n\nplaintiffs, to prohibit speech and association \u201conly when the defendant\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV\n   We turn to the question whether the material-support\nstatute, as applied to plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\u201cA conviction fails to comport with due process if the stat\u00ad\nute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of\nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is\nso standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\u201d United States v. Williams,\n553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute\nis vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for \u201c[a]\nplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly\nproscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as\napplied to the conduct of others.\u201d Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).\nWe have said that when a statute \u201cinterferes with the\nright of free speech or of association, a more stringent\nvagueness test should apply.\u201d Id., at 499. \u201cBut \u2018perfect\nclarity and precise guidance have never been required\neven of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\u2019 \u201d\nWilliams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).\n   The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.\nInstead, the lower court merged plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness\nchallenge with their First Amendment claims, holding\nthat portions of the material-support statute were uncon\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nknows or intends that those activities will assist the organization\u2019s\nunlawful terrorist actions.\u201d Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord\u00ad\ning to the dissent, this interpretation is \u201cfairly possible\u201d and adopting it\nwould avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72339B fails for essentially the\nsame reasons as plaintiffs\u2019. Congress explained what \u201cknowingly\u201d\nmeans in \u00a72339B, and it did not choose the dissent\u2019s interpretation of\nthat term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement\nindistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in \u00a7\u00a72339A and\n2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in\n\u00a72339B.\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutionally vague because they applied to protected\nspeech\u2014regardless of whether those applications were\nclear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary\nintelligence understood the scope of the term \u201ctraining,\u201d\nthat term would \u201cremai[n] impermissibly vague\u201d because\nit could \u201cbe read to encompass speech and advocacy pro\u00ad\ntected by the First Amendment.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 929. It also\nfound \u201cservice\u201d and a portion of \u201cexpert advice or assis\u00ad\ntance\u201d to be vague because those terms covered protected\nspeech. Id., at 929\u2013930.\n   Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not\naddressing a \u201cfacial vagueness challenge,\u201d id., at 929, n. 6,\nthe Court of Appeals considered the statute\u2019s application\nto facts not before it. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied\non the Government\u2019s statement that \u00a72339B would bar\nfiling an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist\norganization\u2014which plaintiffs have not told us they wish\nto do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs\nwished to do\u2014to conclude that the statute barred pro\u00ad\ntected advocacy and was therefore vague. See id., at 930.\nBy deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical cir\u00ad\ncumstances, the Court of Appeals\u2019 discussion of vagueness\nseemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment\noverbreadth doctrine. See id., at 929\u2013930 (finding it \u201ceasy\nto imagine\u201d protected expression that would be barred by\n\u00a72339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 930\n(referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).\n   In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contra\u00ad\nvened the rule that \u201c[a] plaintiff who engages in some\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the\nvagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d\nHoffman Estates, supra, at 495. That rule makes no ex\u00ad\nception for conduct in the form of speech. See Parker v.\nLevy, 417 U. S. 733, 755\u2013757 (1974). Thus, even to the\nextent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plain\u00ad\ntiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a suc\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncessful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly\ncannot do so based on the speech of others. Such a plain\u00ad\ntiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First\nAmendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth\nAmendment vagueness challenge does not turn on\nwhether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected\nexpression. See Williams, supra, at 304; Hoffman Estates,\nsupra, at 494\u2013495, 497. Otherwise the doctrines would be\nsubstantially redundant.\n   Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs\u2019 claims of vagueness\nlack merit. Plaintiffs do not argue that the material\u00ad\nsupport statute grants too much enforcement discretion to\nthe Government. We therefore address only whether the\nstatute \u201cprovide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited.\u201d Williams, 553 U. S., at 304.\n   As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here\nare quite different from the sorts of terms that we have\npreviously declared to be vague. We have in the past\n\u201cstruck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to\nwhether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u2018annoying\u2019 or \u2018inde\u00ad\ncent\u2019\u2014wholly subjective judgments without statutory\ndefinitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\u201d\nId., at 306; see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S.\n156, n. 1 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that pun\u00ad\nished \u201cvagrants,\u201d defined to include \u201crogues and vaga\u00ad\nbonds,\u201d \u201cpersons who use juggling,\u201d and \u201ccommon night\nwalkers\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying\nthe statutory terms in this action\u2014\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert\nadvice or assistance,\u201d \u201cservice,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d\u2014does not\nrequire similarly untethered, subjective judgments.\n   Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to\nthe material-support statute over time. These definitions\nincreased the clarity of the statute\u2019s terms.            See\n\u00a72339A(b)(2) (\u201c \u2018training\u2019 means instruction or teaching\ndesigned to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge\u201d); \u00a72339A(b)(3) (\u201c \u2018expert advice or assistance\u2019\nmeans advice or assistance derived from scientific, techni\u00ad\ncal or other specialized knowledge\u201d); \u00a72339B(h) (clarifying\nthe scope of \u201cpersonnel\u201d). And the knowledge requirement\nof the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,\nas we have held with respect to other statutes containing a\nsimilar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,\n732 (2000); Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511\nU. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455\nU. S., at 499.\n   Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may\nnot be clear in every application. But the dispositive point\nhere is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica\u00ad\ntion to plaintiffs\u2019 proposed conduct, which means that\nplaintiffs\u2019 vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming\nthat a heightened standard applies because the material\u00ad\nsupport statute potentially implicates speech, the statu\u00ad\ntory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114\u2013115 (1972)\n(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that\nimplicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,\nat 223 (same).\n   Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage\nreadily fall within the scope of the terms \u201ctraining\u201d and\n\u201cexpert advice or assistance.\u201d Plaintiffs want to \u201ctrain\nmembers of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and\ninternational law to peacefully resolve disputes,\u201d and\n\u201cteach PKK members how to petition various representa\u00ad\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\u201d 552\nF. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would\nunderstand that instruction on resolving disputes through\ninternational law falls within the statute\u2019s definition of\n\u201ctraining\u201d because it imparts a \u201cspecific skill,\u201d not \u201cgeneral\nknowledge.\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs\u2019 activities also fall\ncomfortably within the scope of \u201cexpert advice or assis\u00ad\ntance\u201d: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In fact,\nplaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms\n\u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert advice\u201d throughout this litigation to\ndescribe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that\nthese common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs\u2019\nconduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,\n59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.\n   Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations\ndesigned to test the limits of \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cexpert advice\nor assistance.\u201d They argue that the statutory definitions\nof these terms use words of degree\u2014like \u201cspecific,\u201d \u201cgen\u00ad\neral,\u201d and \u201cspecialized\u201d\u2014and that it is difficult to apply\nthose definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain\u00ad\ntiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography\nwould constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen\ntile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we\nfound vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a\ncriminal case, when speaking to the press, \u201cmay state\nwithout elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .\ndefense.\u201d Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Whatever force these arguments might have in the\nabstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not\npropose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek\nrefuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary\nbetween \u201cspecific skills\u201d and \u201cgeneral knowledge.\u201d See\nParker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this\npoint in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo\u00ad\nretical doubts regarding the distinction between \u201cactive\u201d\nand \u201cnominal\u201d membership in an organization\u2014also terms\nof degree\u2014the defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge failed\nbecause his \u201ccase present[ed] no such problem.\u201d 367 U.

We did not suggest that counsel could escape disci\u00ad\npline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly\nprohibited.\n   Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in\n\u201cpolitical advocacy\u201d on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey\nand Tamils living in Sri Lanka. 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nThey are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded\nas \u201cmaterial support\u201d in the form of providing \u201cpersonnel\u201d\nor \u201cservice[s],\u201d and assert that the statute is unconstitu\u00ad\ntionally vague because they cannot tell.\n   As for \u201cpersonnel,\u201d Congress enacted a limiting defini\u00ad\ntion in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness concerns.\nProviding material support that constitutes \u201cpersonnel\u201d is\ndefined as knowingly providing a person \u201cto work under\nthat terrorist organization\u2019s direction or control or to\norganize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the op\u00ad\neration of that organization.\u201d \u00a72339B(h). The statute\nmakes clear that \u201cpersonnel\u201d does not cover independent\nadvocacy: \u201cIndividuals who act entirely independently of\nthe foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or\nobjectives shall not be considered to be working under the\nforeign terrorist organization\u2019s direction and control.\u201d\nIbid.\n   \u201c[S]ervice\u201d similarly refers to concerted activity, not\nindependent advocacy. See Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining \u201cservice\u201d to mean\n\u201cthe performance of work commanded or paid for by an\u00ad\nother: a servant\u2019s duty: attendance on a superior\u201d; or \u201can\nact done for the benefit or at the command of another\u201d).\nContext confirms that ordinary meaning here. The statute\nprohibits providing a service \u201cto a foreign terrorist organi\u00ad\nzation.\u201d \u00a72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). The use of the\nword \u201cto\u201d indicates a connection between the service and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe foreign group. We think a person of ordinary intelli\u00ad\ngence would understand that independently advocating for\na cause is different from providing a service to a group\nthat is advocating for that cause.\n   Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terror\u00ad\nist group could be characterized as a \u201cservice,\u201d the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s specific exclusion of independent activity in the\ndefinition of \u201cpersonnel\u201d would not make sense. Congress\nwould not have prohibited under \u201cservice\u201d what it specifi\u00ad\ncally exempted from prohibition under \u201cpersonnel.\u201d The\nother types of material support listed in the statute, in\u00ad\ncluding \u201clodging,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cexplosives,\u201d and \u201ctranspor\u00ad\ntation,\u201d \u00a72339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could\nbe provided independently of a foreign terrorist organiza\u00ad\ntion. We interpret \u201cservice\u201d along the same lines. Thus,\nany independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to\nengage is not prohibited by \u00a72339B. On the other hand, a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would understand the term\n\u201cservice\u201d to cover advocacy performed in coordination with,\nor at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.\n   Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute\nposes difficult questions of exactly how much direction or\ncoordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a\n\u201cservice.\u201d See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09\u201389,\np. 14 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (\u201cWould any\ncommunication with any member be sufficient? With a\nleader? Must the \u2018relationship\u2019 have any formal elements,\nsuch as an employment or contractual relationship? What\nabout a relationship through an intermediary?\u201d). The\nproblem with these questions is that they are entirely\nhypothetical. Plaintiffs have not provided any specific\narticulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate\ntheir advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE. They have\ninstead described the form of their intended advocacy only\nin the most general terms. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs\n10\u201311 (plaintiffs \u201cwould like, among other things, to offer\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the\nKurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations\nand the United States Congress\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would\nlike to \u201cwrite and distribute publications supportive of the\nPKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation\u201d and \u201cadvocate\nfor the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey\u201d).\n   Deciding whether activities described at such a level of\ngenerality would constitute prohibited \u201cservice[s]\u201d under\nthe statute would require \u201csheer speculation\u201d\u2014which\nmeans that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforce\u00ad\nment challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Wash\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454 (2008).\nIt is apparent with respect to these claims that \u201cgrada\u00ad\ntions of fact or charge would make a difference as to\ncriminal liability,\u201d and so \u201cadjudication of the reach and\nconstitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact\nsituation.\u201d Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 20 (1965).\n                              V\n\n                              A\n\n  We next consider whether the material-support statute,\nas applied to plaintiffs, violates the freedom of speech\nguaranteed by the First Amendment. Both plaintiffs and\nthe Government take extreme positions on this question.\nPlaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their \u201cpure\npolitical speech.\u201d E.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43. It has\nnot. Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may\nsay anything they wish on any topic. They may speak and\nwrite freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of\nTurkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international\nlaw. They may advocate before the United Nations. As\nthe Government states: \u201cThe statute does not prohibit\nindependent advocacy or expression of any kind.\u201d Brief for\nGovernment 13. Section 2339B also \u201cdoes not prevent\n[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nor impose any sanction on them for doing so.\u201d Id., at 60.\nCongress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or\nopinions in the form of \u201cpure political speech.\u201d Rather,\nCongress has prohibited \u201cmaterial support,\u201d which most\noften does not take the form of speech at all. And when it\ndoes, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\ncategory of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordi\u00ad\nnation with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be\nterrorist organizations.4\n   For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far,\nclaiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation\nis conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is directed at the\nfact of plaintiffs\u2019 interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the\nGovernment contends, and only incidentally burdens their\nexpression. The Government argues that the proper\nstandard of review is therefore the one set out in United\nStates v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). In that case, the\nCourt rejected a First Amendment challenge to a convic\u00ad\ntion under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying\ndraft cards, even though O\u2019Brien had burned his card in\nprotest against the draft. See id., at 370, 376, 382. In so\ndoing, we applied what we have since called \u201cintermediate\nscrutiny,\u201d under which a \u201ccontent-neutral regulation will\nbe sustained under the First Amendment if it advances\nimportant governmental interests unrelated to the sup\u00ad\npression of free speech and does not burden substantially\nmore speech than necessary to further those interests.\u201d\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180,\n189 (1997) (citing O\u2019Brien, supra, at 377).\n   The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent also analyzes the statute as if it prohibited \u201c[p]eaceful\n\npolitical advocacy\u201d or \u201cpure speech and association,\u201d without more.\nPost, at 9, 17. Section 2339B does not do that, and we do not address\nthe constitutionality of any such prohibitions. The dissent\u2019s claim that\nour decision is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s cases analyzing those\nsorts of restrictions, post, at 11\u201312, is accordingly unfounded.\n22         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nissue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to\nargue that O\u2019Brien provides the correct standard of re\u00ad\nview.5 O\u2019Brien does not provide the applicable standard\nfor reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385\u2013386 (1992); Texas\nv. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406\u2013407 (1989), and\n\u00a72339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain\u00ad\ntiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether\nthey may do so under \u00a72339B depends on what they say.\nIf plaintiffs\u2019 speech to those groups imparts a \u201cspecific\nskill\u201d or communicates advice derived from \u201cspecialized\nknowledge\u201d\u2014for example, training on the use of interna\u00ad\ntional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations\u2014\nthen it is barred. See Brief for Government 33\u201334. On the\nother hand, plaintiffs\u2019 speech is not barred if it imparts\nonly general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.\n   The Government argues that \u00a72339B should nonethe\u00ad\nless receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally\nfunctions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs\nheadlong into a number of our precedents, most promi\u00ad\nnently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen\nalso involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,\nbarring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when\nCohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an\nepithet, we did not apply O\u2019Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.\nInstead, we recognized that the generally applicable law\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs\u2019\nactivities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the\nFirst Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi\u00ad\nnated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,\nlike the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;\nReply Brief for Government 31\u201332, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.\nEmpire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not\nconsider any such argument because the Government does not develop\nit: The Government\u2019s submission is that applying \u00a72339B to plaintiffs\ntriggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny\u2014not that it triggers\nno First Amendment scrutiny at all.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu\u00ad\nnicated\u2014he violated the breach of the peace statute be\u00ad\ncause of the offensive content of his particular message.\nWe accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re\u00ad\nversed his conviction. See id., at 18\u201319, 26.\n   This suit falls into the same category. The law here\nmay be described as directed at conduct, as the law in\nCohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap\u00ad\nplied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under\nthe statute consists of communicating a message. As we\nexplained in Texas v. Johnson: \u201cIf the [Government\u2019s]\nregulation is not related to expression, then the less strin\u00ad\ngent standard we announced in United States v. O\u2019Brien\nfor regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If\nit is, then we are outside of O\u2019Brien\u2019s test, and we must\n[apply] a more demanding standard.\u201d 491 U. S., at 403\n(citation omitted).\n                              B\n   The First Amendment issue before us is more refined\nthan either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It\nis not whether the Government may prohibit pure political\nspeech, or may prohibit material support in the form of\nconduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro\u00ad\nhibit what plaintiffs want to do\u2014provide material support\nto the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.\n   Everyone agrees that the Government\u2019s interest in\ncombating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest\norder. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is\nthat the ban on material support, applied to what they\nwish to do, is not \u201cnecessary to further that interest.\u201d\nIbid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify\nprohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their\nsupport will advance only the legitimate activities of the\ndesignated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.\nId., at 51\u201352.\n24        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\nsegregate support of their legitimate activities from sup\u00ad\nport of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en\u00ad\nacted \u00a72339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings\nregarding the serious threat posed by international terror\u00ad\nism. See AEDPA \u00a7\u00a7301(a)(1)\u2013(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339B (Findings and Purpose). One\nof those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs\u2019 contention\nthat their support would not further the terrorist activities\nof the PKK and LTTE: \u201c[F]oreign organizations that en\u00ad\ngage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\nconduct that any contribution to such an organization\nfacilitates that conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a)(7) (emphasis added).\n   Plaintiffs argue that the reference to \u201cany contribution\u201d\nin this finding meant only monetary support. There is no\nreason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly\nbecause Congress expressly prohibited so much more than\nmonetary support in \u00a72339B. Congress\u2019s use of the term\n\u201ccontribution\u201d is best read to reflect a determination that\nany form of material support furnished \u201cto\u201d a foreign\nterrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely\nwhat the material-support statute does. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted \u00a72339B, Congress simultaneously re\u00ad\nmoved an exception that had existed in \u00a72339A(a) (1994\ned.) for the provision of material support in the form of\n\u201chumanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved\nin\u201d terrorist activity. AEDPA \u00a7323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205\nF. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful\naid would have no harmful effects.\n   We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject\u00ad\ning that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.\n\u201cThe PKK\u2019s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000\nlives.\u201d Declaration of Kenneth R.

Id., at 130\u2013132; Brief for Government 6\u20137. \u201cOn\nJanuary 31, 1996, the LTTE exploded a truck bomb filled\nwith an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at the Cen\u00ad\ntral Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring\nmore than 1,400. This bombing was the most deadly\nterrorist incident in the world in 1996.\u201d McKune Affida\u00ad\nvit, App. 131, \u00b66.h. It is not difficult to conclude as Con\u00ad\ngress did that the \u201ctain[t]\u201d of such violent activities is so\ngreat that working in coordination with or at the com\u00ad\nmand of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and\nfurther their terrorist means.

Such support frees up\nother resources within the organization that may be put to\nviolent ends. It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to\nforeign terrorist groups\u2014legitimacy that makes it easier\nfor those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to\nraise funds\u2014all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.\n\u201cTerrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\n\u2018firewalls\u2019 that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and\ncommingling of support and benefits.\u201d McKune Affidavit,\nApp. 135, \u00b611. \u201c[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror\u00ad\nist groups systematically conceal their activities behind\ncharitable, social, and political fronts.\u201d M.

Brief for Government 6; App. 128.\nThat nation and our other allies would react sharply to\nAmericans furnishing material support to foreign groups\nlike the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the expla\u00ad\nnation that the support was meant only to further those\ngroups\u2019 \u201clegitimate\u201d activities. From Turkey\u2019s perspective,\nthere likely are no such activities. See 352 F. 3d, at 389\n(observing that Turkey prohibits membership in the PKK\nand prosecutes those who provide support to that group,\nregardless of whether the support is directed to lawful\nactivities).\n                              C\n  In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distin\u00ad\nguish material support for a foreign terrorist group\u2019s\nviolent activities and its nonviolent activities, we do not\nrely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the\nrecord evidence. We have before us an affidavit stating\nthe Executive Branch\u2019s conclusion on that question. The\nState Department informs us that \u201c[t]he experience and\nanalysis of the U.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14\u201315) (looking to similar\naffidavits to support according weight to national security\nclaims). In the Executive\u2019s view: \u201cGiven the purposes,\norganizational structure, and clandestine nature of foreign\nterrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any mate\u00ad\nrial support to these organizations will ultimately inure to\nthe benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\u2014\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly in\u00ad\ntended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities.\u201d\nMcKune Affidavit, App. 133, \u00b68.\n  That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Con\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This litigation\nimplicates sensitive and weighty interests of national\nsecurity and foreign affairs. The PKK and the LTTE have\ncommitted terrorist acts against American citizens abroad,\nand the material-support statute addresses acute foreign\npolicy concerns involving relationships with our Nation\u2019s\nallies. See id., at 128\u2013133, 137. We have noted that \u201cnei\u00ad\nther the Members of this Court nor most federal judges\nbegin the day with briefings that may describe new and\nserious threats to our Nation and its people.\u201d Boumediene\nv. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 797 (2008). It is vital in this con\u00ad\ntext \u201cnot to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence\nfor a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.\u201d\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 68 (1981). See Wald,\n468 U. S., at 242; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981).\n   Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns\nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant\nabdication of the judicial role. We do not defer to the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of the First Amendment, even when\nsuch interests are at stake. We are one with the dissent\nthat the Government\u2019s \u201cauthority and expertise in these\nmatters do not automatically trump the Court\u2019s own obli\u00ad\ngation to secure the protection that the Constitution\ngrants to individuals.\u201d Post, at 23. But when it comes to\ncollecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this\narea, \u201cthe lack of competence on the part of the courts is\nmarked,\u201d Rostker, supra, at 65, and respect for the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s conclusions is appropriate.\n   One reason for that respect is that national security and\nforeign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to\nconfront evolving threats in an area where information\ncan be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct\ndifficult to assess. The dissent slights these real con\u00ad\nstraints in demanding hard proof\u2014with \u201cdetail,\u201d \u201cspecific\nfacts,\u201d and \u201cspecific evidence\u201d\u2014that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed\nactivities will support terrorist attacks. See post, at 9, 16,\n30        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23. That would be a dangerous requirement. In this\ncontext, conclusions must often be based on informed\njudgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality\naffects what we may reasonably insist on from the Gov\u00ad\nernment. The material-support statute is, on its face, a\npreventive measure\u2014it criminalizes not terrorist attacks\nthemselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to\noccur. The Government, when seeking to prevent immi\u00ad\nnent harms in the context of international affairs and\nnational security, is not required to conclusively link all\nthe pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its\nempirical conclusions. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S., at 17\n(\u201c[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of\ncontemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . .\nmust of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it\ncustomarily wields in domestic areas\u201d).\n   This context is different from that in decisions like\nCohen. In that case, the application of the statute turned\non the offensiveness of the speech at issue. Observing that\n\u201cone man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric,\u201d we invalidated\nCohen\u2019s conviction in part because we concluded that\n\u201cgovernmental officials cannot make principled distinc\u00ad\ntions in this area.\u201d 403 U. S., at 25. In this litigation, by\ncontrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely posi\u00ad\ntioned to make principled distinctions between activities\nthat will further terrorist conduct and undermine United\nStates foreign policy, and those that will not.\n   We also find it significant that Congress has been con\u00ad\nscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions\nmay implicate constitutional concerns. First, \u00a72339B only\napplies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nThere is, and always has been, a limited number of those\norganizations designated by the Executive Branch, see,\ne.g., 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997),\nand any groups so designated may seek judicial review of\nthe designation. Second, in response to the lower courts\u2019\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nholdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the\nstatute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms\n\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cpersonnel,\u201d and \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d\nas well as an explanation of the knowledge required to\nviolate \u00a72339B. Third, in effectuating its stated intent not\nto abridge First Amendment rights, see \u00a72339B(i), Con\u00ad\ngress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in\ncreating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.\nThe definition of material support, for example, excludes\nmedicine and religious materials. See \u00a72339A(b)(1). In\nthis area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature\u2019s\nsuperior capacity for weighing competing interests means\nthat \u201cwe must be particularly careful not to substitute our\njudgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.\u201d Rost\nker, supra, at 68. Finally, and most importantly, Congress\nhas avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or\nindeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or\ncontrolled by foreign terrorist groups.\n  At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the consid\u00ad\nered judgment of Congress and the Executive that provid\u00ad\ning material support to a designated foreign terrorist\norganization\u2014even seemingly benign support\u2014bolsters\nthe terrorist activities of that organization. That judg\u00ad\nment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we\nhave persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given\nthe sensitive interests in national security and foreign\naffairs at stake, the political branches have adequately\nsubstantiated their determination that, to serve the Gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s interest in preventing terrorism, it was neces\u00ad\nsary to prohibit providing material support in the form of\ntraining, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign\nterrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote\nonly the groups\u2019 nonviolent ends.\n  We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to\nundertake. First, plaintiffs propose to \u201ctrain members of\n[the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international\n32        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to peacefully resolve disputes.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nCongress can, consistent with the First Amendment,\nprohibit this direct training. It is wholly foreseeable that\nthe PKK could use the \u201cspecific skill[s]\u201d that plaintiffs\npropose to impart, \u00a72339A(b)(2), as part of a broader\nstrategy to promote terrorism. The PKK could, for exam\u00ad\nple, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time\nto recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into\ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed at\u00ad\ntacks. See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The\nPKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286\u2013295\n(2007) (describing the PKK\u2019s suspension of armed struggle\nand subsequent return to violence). A foreign terrorist\norganization introduced to the structures of the interna\u00ad\ntional legal system might use the information to threaten,\nmanipulate, and disrupt. This possibility is real, not\nremote.\n   Second, plaintiffs propose to \u201cteach PKK members how\nto petition various representative bodies such as the\nUnited Nations for relief.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. The\nGovernment acts within First Amendment strictures in\nbanning this proposed speech because it teaches the or\u00ad\nganization how to acquire \u201crelief,\u201d which plaintiffs never\ndefine with any specificity, and which could readily in\u00ad\nclude monetary aid. See Brief for Plaintiffs 10\u201311, 16\u201317,\nn. 10; App. 58\u201359, 80\u201381. Indeed, earlier in this litigation,\nplaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE \u201cto present claims for\ntsunami-related aid to mediators and international bod\u00ad\nies,\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1, which naturally included\nmonetary relief. Money is fungible, supra, at 26, and\nCongress logically concluded that money a terrorist group\nsuch as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs\npropose to teach could be redirected to funding the group\u2019s\nviolent activities.\n   Finally, plaintiffs propose to \u201cengage in political advo\u00ad\ncacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,\u201d and \u201cengage\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri\nLanka.\u201d 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. As explained above, su\npra, at 19\u201320, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level\nof coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what\nexactly their \u201cadvocacy\u201d would consist of. Plaintiffs\u2019 pro\u00ad\nposals are phrased at such a high level of generality that\nthey cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge. See\nsupra, at 20; Grange, 552 U. S., at 454; Zemel, 381 U. S.,\nat 20.\n   In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to ad\u00ad\ndress the real dangers at stake. It instead considers only\nthe possible benefits of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed activities in the\nabstract. See post, at 13\u201315. The dissent seems unwilling\nto entertain the prospect that training and advising a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization on how to take\nadvantage of international entities might benefit that\norganization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activi\u00ad\nties. In the dissent\u2019s world, such training is all to the\ngood. Congress and the Executive, however, have con\u00ad\ncluded that we live in a different world: one in which the\ndesignated foreign terrorist organizations \u201care so tainted\nby their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.\u201d AEDPA \u00a7301(a)(7).\nOne in which, for example, \u201cthe United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish\nrefugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come\nunder the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to\nrespect its \u2018neutral and humanitarian nature.\u2019 \u201d McKune\nAffidavit, App. 135\u2013136, \u00b613. Training and advice on how\nto work with the United Nations could readily have helped\nthe PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a\nbase for terrorist activities.\n   If only good can come from training our adversaries in\ninternational dispute resolution, presumably it would\nhave been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens\nfrom training the Japanese Government on using interna\u00ad\n34        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes\nduring World War II. It would, under the dissent\u2019s rea\u00ad\nsoning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving\ndisputes through \u201c \u2018deliberative forces,\u2019 \u201d post, at 13 (quot\u00ad\ning Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that\nassisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort\nmore generally. That view is not one the First Amend\u00ad\nment requires us to embrace.\n   All this is not to say that any future applications of the\nmaterial-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur\u00ad\nvive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that\nany other statute relating to speech and terrorism would\nsatisfy the First Amendment. In particular, we in no way\nsuggest that a regulation of independent speech would\npass constitutional muster, even if the Government were\nto show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organi\u00ad\nzations. We also do not suggest that Congress could ex\u00ad\ntend the same prohibition on material support at issue\nhere to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in\nprohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs\nseek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, \u00a72339B does\nnot violate the freedom of speech.\n                              VI\n  Plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the material-support stat\u00ad\nute violates their freedom of association under the First\nAmendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminal\u00ad\nizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and\nthe LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De\nJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which\nwe have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist\nParty, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\nState of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,\n389 U. S. 258 (1967).\n  The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause the statute does not penalize mere association with\na foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put\nit: \u201cThe statute does not prohibit being a member of one of\nthe designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup\u00ad\nporting the political goals of the group. . . . What [\u00a72339B]\nprohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .\u201d 205\nF. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci\u00ad\nsions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as\u00ad\nsembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at\n262 (\u201cIt is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis\u00ad\ncriminately across all types of association with Commu\u00ad\nnist-action groups, without regard to the quality and\ndegree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First\nAmendment\u201d); De Jonge, supra, at 362.\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute\nburdens their freedom of association because it prevents\nthem from providing support to designated foreign terror\u00ad\nist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for\nPlaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37\u201338. Any burden\non plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of association in this regard is justi\u00ad\nfied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs\u2019\nfree speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu\u00ad\ntion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of\nspeech that constitute material support, but did not per\u00ad\nmit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly\ndangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is\nnot required to ban material support to every group or\nnone at all.\n                        *   *    *\n  The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the\npeople of the United States ordained and established that\ncharter of government in part to \u201cprovide for the common\ndefence.\u201d As Madison explained, \u201c[s]ecurity against for\u00ad\neign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the\nAmerican Union.\u201d The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J.

We hold that, in regulating the particular forms\nof support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror\u00ad\nist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective\nconsistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth\nAmendments.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con\u00ad\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the Constitution permits the Government to prose\ncute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated\nteaching and advocacy furthering the designated organiza\ntions\u2019 lawful political objectives. In my view, the Govern\nment has not met its burden of showing that an interpre\ntation of the statute that would prohibit this speech- and\nassociation-related activity serves the Government\u2019s com\npelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would\ninterpret the statute as normally placing activity of this\nkind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

All these ac\ntivities are of a kind that the First Amendment ordinarily\nprotects.\n   In my view, the Government has not made the strong\nshowing necessary to justify under the First Amendment\nthe criminal prosecution of those who engage in these\nactivities.

Thus, there is\nno general First Amendment exception that applies here.\nIf the statute is constitutional in this context, it would\nhave to come with a strong justification attached.\n  It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the\nconstitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs\u2019\nproposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme\ndiate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,\nbut \u201c \u2018a more demanding standard.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 23 (quoting\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989)). Indeed,\nwhere, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at\nleast arguably does so on the basis of content-based dis\ntinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute\nand justifications \u201cstrictly\u201d\u2014to determine whether the\nprohibition is justified by a \u201ccompelling\u201d need that cannot\nbe \u201cless restrictively\u201d accommodated. See Houston v. Hill,\n482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (criminal penalties); Ashcroft v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002)\n(content-based); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.

I do\nnot dispute the importance of this interest. But I do dis\npute whether the interest can justify the statute\u2019s criminal\nprohibition. To put the matter more specifically, precisely\nhow does application of the statute to the protected activi\nties before us help achieve that important security-related\nend?

HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion. First, the Government says that the plaintiffs\u2019 sup\nport for these organizations is \u201cfungible\u201d in the same sense\nas other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the\nplaintiffs\u2019 support could, for example, free up other re\nsources, which the organization might put to terrorist\nends. Brief for Respondents in No. 09\u201389, pp. 54\u201356 (here\ninafter Government Brief).\n   The proposition that the two very different kinds of\n\u201csupport\u201d are \u201cfungible,\u201d however, is not obviously true.\nThere is no obvious way in which undertaking advocacy\nfor political change through peaceful means or teaching\nthe PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Na\ntions for political change is fungible with other resources\nthat might be put to more sinister ends in the way that\ndonations of money, food, or computer training are fungi\nble. It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities\ncan themselves be redirected, or will free other resources\nthat can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we\nmust determine whether the Government has come for\nward with evidence to support its claim.\n   The Government has provided us with no empirical\ninformation that might convincingly support this claim.\nInstead, the Government cites only to evidence that Con\ngress was concerned about the \u201cfungible\u201d nature in general\nof resources, predominately money and material goods. It\npoints to a congressional finding that \u201cforeign organiza\ntions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by\ntheir criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.\u201d \u00a7301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247, note following 18 U. S. C. \u00a72339B (emphasis\nadded). It also points to a House Report\u2019s statement that\n\u201csupply[ing] funds, goods, or services\u201d would \u201chel[p] defray\nthe cost to the terrorist organization of running the osten\nsibly legitimate activities,\u201d and \u201cin turn fre[e] an equal\nsum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.\u201d H. R.\nRep. No. 104\u2013383, p. 81 (1995) (emphasis added). Finally,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Government refers to a State Department official\u2019s\naffidavit describing how ostensibly charitable contribu\ntions have either been \u201credirected\u201d to terrorist ends or,\neven if spent charitably, have \u201cunencumber[ed] funds\nraised from other sources for use in facilitating violent,\nterrorist activities and gaining political support for these\nactivities.\u201d Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134,\n136 (emphasis added).\n   The most one can say in the Government\u2019s favor about\nthese statements is that they might be read as offering\nhighly general support for its argument. The statements\ndo not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs\u2019\npolitical-advocacy-related activities might actually be\n\u201cfungible\u201d and therefore capable of being diverted to ter\nrorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was\nconcerned with \u201csupport\u201d of this kind. The affidavit refers\nto \u201cfunds,\u201d \u201cfinancing,\u201d and \u201cgoods\u201d\u2014none of which en\ncompasses the plaintiffs\u2019 activities. Ibid. The statutory\nstatement and the House Report use broad terms like\n\u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d that might be construed as\nencompassing the plaintiffs\u2019 activities. But in context,\nthose terms are more naturally understood as referring to\ncontributions of goods, money, or training and other ser\nvices (say, computer programming) that could be diverted\nto, or free funding for, terrorist ends. See infra, at 15\u201316.\nPeaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into\nthese categories. And the statute itself suggests that\nCongress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or\nassociation. See \u00a72339B(i) (\u201cNothing in this section shall\nbe construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of\nrights guaranteed under the First Amendment\u201d); see also\ninfra, at 18\u201319.\n   Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs\u2019 pro\nposed activities will \u201cbolste[r] a terrorist organization\u2019s\nefficacy and strength in a community\u201d and \u201cundermin[e]\nthis nation\u2019s efforts to delegitimize and weaken those\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngroups.\u201d Government Brief 56 (emphasis added). In the\nCourt\u2019s view, too, the Constitution permits application of\nthe statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because\nthose activities could provide a group that engages in\nterrorism with \u201clegitimacy.\u201d Ante, at 25. The Court sug\ngests that, armed with this greater \u201clegitimacy,\u201d these\norganizations will more readily be able to obtain material\nsupport of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban\u2014\nmoney, arms, lodging, and the like. See ibid.\n   Yet the Government does not claim that the statute\nforbids any speech \u201clegitimating\u201d a terrorist group.\nRather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership\nin terrorist organizations, (2) \u201cpeaceably assembling with\nmembers of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,\u201d or\n(3) \u201cindependent advocacy\u201d on behalf of these organiza\ntions. Government Brief 66, 61, 13. The Court, too, em\nphasizes that activities not \u201ccoordinated with\u201d the terror\nist groups are not banned. See ante, at 21, 26, 31\n(emphasis added). And it argues that speaking, writing,\nand teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization\u2019s\npeaceful political ends could \u201cmak[e] it easier for those\ngroups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.\u201d\nAnte, at 25.\n   But this \u201clegitimacy\u201d justification cannot by itself war\nrant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and asso\nciation. Speech, association, and related activities on\nbehalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to le\ngitimate that group. Thus, were the law to accept a \u201cle\ngitimating\u201d effect, in and of itself and without qualifica\ntion, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a\nban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold\ninstances where it should be won. Once one accepts this\nargument, there is no natural stopping place. The argu\nment applies as strongly to \u201cindependent\u201d as to \u201ccoordi\nnated\u201d advocacy. But see ante, at 26\u201327. That fact is\nreflected in part in the Government\u2019s claim that the ban\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhere, so supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a desig\nnated group from filing on behalf of that group an amicus\nbrief before the United Nations or even before this Court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201349, 53.\n   That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a\nline designed to accept the legitimacy argument in some\ninstances but not in others. It is inordinately difficult to\ndistinguish when speech activity will and when it will not\ninitiate the chain of causation the Court suggests\u2014a chain\nthat leads from peaceful advocacy to \u201clegitimacy\u201d to in\ncreased support for the group to an increased supply of\nmaterial goods that support its terrorist activities. Even\nwere we to find some such line of distinction, its applica\ntion would seem so inherently uncertain that it would\noften, perhaps always, \u201cchill\u201d protected speech beyond its\nboundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply\nin abstract terms and without limitation, must always, or\nit will never, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plain\ntiffs\u2019 activities, \u201calways\u201d cannot possibly be the First\nAmendment\u2019s answer.\n   Regardless, the \u201clegitimacy\u201d justification itself is incon\nsistent with critically important First Amendment case\nlaw. Consider the cases involving the protection the First\nAmendment offered those who joined the Communist\nParty intending only to further its peaceful activities. In\nthose cases, this Court took account of congressional find\nings that the Communist Party not only advocated theo\nretically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow\nof our Government through force and violence. The Court\nhad previously accepted Congress\u2019 determinations that the\nAmerican Communist Party was a \u201cCommunist action\norganization\u201d which (1) acted under the \u201ccontrol, direction,\nand discipline\u201d of the world Communist movement, a\nmovement that sought to employ \u201cespionage, sabotage,\nterrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to\nestablish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,\u201d and (2)\n12        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cendeavor[ed]\u201d to bring about \u201cthe overthrow of existing\ngovernments by . . . force if necessary.\u201d Communist Party\nof United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367\nU. S. 1, 5\u20136 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment\nprotected an American\u2019s right to belong to that party\u2014\ndespite whatever \u201clegitimating\u201d effect membership might\nhave had\u2014as long as the person did not share the party\u2019s\nunlawful purposes. See, e.g., De Jonge, 299 U. S. 353;\nScales, 367 U. S., at 228\u2013230; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384\nU. S. 11, 17 (1966); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.\nof State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605\u2013610 (1967); Robel, 389\nU. S. 258 (holding that national security interests did not\njustify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of\nCommunist-affiliated organizations working in any de\nfense-related facility). As I have pointed out, those cases\ndraw further support from other cases permitting pure\nadvocacy of even the most unlawful activity\u2014as long as\nthat advocacy is not \u201cdirected to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or produce\nsuch action.\u201d Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447. The Gov\nernment\u2019s \u201clegitimating\u201d theory would seem to apply to\nthese cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized,\nit would have led this Court to conclusions other than\nthose it reached.\n\n   Nor can the Government overcome these considerations\nsimply by narrowing the covered activities to those that\ninvolve coordinated, rather than independent, advocacy.\nConversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements\nmight well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related\nactivities here at issue (just as conversations and discus\nsions are a necessary part of membership in any organiza\ntion). The Government does not distinguish this kind of\n\u201ccoordination\u201d from any other. I am not aware of any form\nof words that might be used to describe \u201ccoordination\u201d that\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

And, as for the Government\u2019s willingness to distin\nguish independent advocacy from coordinated advocacy,\nthe former is more likely, not less likely, to confer legiti\nmacy than the latter. Thus, other things being equal, the\ndistinction \u201ccoordination\u201d makes is arbitrary in respect to\nfurthering the statute\u2019s purposes. And a rule of law that\nfinds the \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument adequate in respect to the\nlatter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute\nthat sought to attack the former.\n   Consider the majority\u2019s development of the Govern\nment\u2019s themes. First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs\u2019\nproposal to \u201c \u2018train members of [the] PKK on how to use\nhumanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve\ndisputes.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 31\u201332 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1).\nThe majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in\nsignificant part on the ground that \u201cpeaceful negotia\ntion[s]\u201d might just \u201cbu[y] time . . . , lulling opponents into\ncomplacency.\u201d Ante, at 32. And the PKK might use its\nnew information about \u201cthe structures of the international\nlegal system . . . to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\u201d\nIbid.\n   What is one to say about these arguments\u2014arguments\nthat would deny First Amendment protection to the peace\nful teaching of international human rights law on the\nground that a little knowledge about \u201cthe international\nlegal system\u201d is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent\u2019s\nsubsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so\nlet\u2019s not teach him how to try? What might be said of\nthese claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation com\nmitted to the resolution of disputes through \u201cdeliberative\nforces\u201d? Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n   In my own view, the majority\u2019s arguments stretch the\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconcept of \u201cfungibility\u201d beyond constitutional limits.\nNeither Congress nor the Government advanced these\nparticular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case\nin this Court\u2014not Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652\n(1925), not Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919),\nnot Abrams, 250 U. S. 616, not the later Communist Party\ncases decided during the heat of the Cold War\u2014in which\nthe Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or\nteaching might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating\ntime for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.\n    Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put\notherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is\nomnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more\nthan (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this\nkind of argument without more and to apply it to the\nteaching of a subject such as international human rights\nlaw is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitu\ntion\u2019s text and First Amendment precedent, would auto\nmatically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case\nwhere national security interests conflict with the First\nAmendment. The Constitution does not allow all such\nconflicts to be decided in the Government\u2019s favor.\n    The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its\narguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain\nfree to engage in the protected activity as long as it is not\n\u201ccoordinated.\u201d That is because there is no practical way to\norganize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about\nhuman rights law) without \u201ccoordination.\u201d Nor can the\nmajority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to\nsome special limiting circumstance present here. That is\nbecause the only evidence the majority offers to support its\ngeneral claim consists of a single reference to a book about\nterrorism, which the Government did not mention, and\nwhich apparently says no more than that at one time the\nPKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to\nit.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The\nmajority\u2019s only argument with respect to this proposal is\nthat the relief obtained \u201ccould readily include monetary\naid,\u201d which the PKK might use to buy guns. Ante, at 32.\nThe majority misunderstands the word \u201crelief.\u201d In this\ncontext, as the record makes clear, the word \u201crelief\u201d does\nnot refer to \u201cmoney.\u201d It refers to recognition under the\nGeneva Conventions. See App. 57\u201358 (2003 Complaint);\nid., at 79\u201380 (1998 Complaint); id., at 113 (Fertig Declara\ntion); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs\u2019 counsel deny\ning that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in\nthe form of money).\n    Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would\ndefer strongly to Congress\u2019 \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d See, e.g.,\nante, at 30. But here, there is no evidence that Congress\nhas made such a judgment regarding the specific activities\nat issue in these cases. See infra, at 20\u201321. In any event,\n\u201cwhenever the fundamental rights of free speech and\nassembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain\nopen [for judicial determination] whether there actually\ndid exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if\nany, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended\nwas one so substantial as to justify the stringent restric\ntion interposed by the legislature.\u201d Whitney, supra, at\n378\u2013379 (Brandeis, J., concurring). In such circum\nstances, the \u201cjudicial function commands analysis of\nwhether the specific conduct charged falls within the\nreach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is\nconsonant with the Constitution.\u201d Landmark Communi\ncations, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 844 (1978). Hence,\na legislative declaration \u201cdoes not preclude enquiry into\nthe question whether, at the time and under the circum\nstances, the conditions existed which are essential to\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvalidity under the Federal Constitution.\u201d Whitney, supra,\nat 378; see also Landmark, supra, at 843 (\u201cDeference to a\nlegislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First\nAmendment rights are at stake\u201d).\n   I concede that the Government\u2019s expertise in foreign\naffairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters,\ne.g., our relations with Turkey. Cf. ante, at 27\u201328. But it\nremains for this Court to decide whether the Government\nhas shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing\nspeech activity otherwise protected by the First Amend\nment. And the fact that other nations may like us less for\ngranting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the\nday.\n   Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Govern\nment nor the majority points to any specific facts that\nshow that the speech-related activities before us are fun\ngible in some special way or confer some special legitimacy\nupon the PKK. Rather, their arguments in this respect\nare general and speculative. Those arguments would\napply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual\npurpose group\u2019s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether\nthe speech-related activity is coordinated). Both First\nAmendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent\nus from \u201csacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so\nspeculative a gain.\u201d Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.\nv. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 127\n(1973); see also Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U. S., at 543\n(rejecting proffered state interest not supported in record\nbecause \u201c[m]ere speculation of harm does not constitute a\ncompelling state interest\u201d).\n                            II\n  For the reasons I have set forth, I believe application of\nthe statute as the Government interprets it would gravely\nand without adequate justification injure interests of the\nkind the First Amendment protects. Thus, there is \u201ca\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nserious doubt\u201d as to the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Cro\nwell, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must\n\u201cascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly\npossible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d Ibid.; see\nalso Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346\u2013348 (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78\n(1994); United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401\n(1916).\n  I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti\ntutional problem is \u201cfairly possible.\u201d In particular, I would\nread the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment\nprotected pure speech and association only when the\ndefendant knows or intends that those activities will assist\nthe organization\u2019s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this\nreading, the Government would have to show, at a mini\nmum, that such defendants provided support that they\nknew was significantly likely to help the organization\npursue its unlawful terrorist aims.\n  A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is\naware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli\nhood that his or her conduct will materially support the\norganization\u2019s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,\n164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code\n\u00a72.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553\nU. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal\nCode \u00a72.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95\u2013605, pt. 1,\npp. 59\u201360 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite\nintent if it is his \u201cconscious objective\u201d (or purpose) to fur\nther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai\nley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code\n\u00a7\u00a72.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (\u201cWhen acting knowingly suffices\nto establish an element, such element also is established if\na person acts purposely\u201d). On the other hand, for the\nreasons I have set out, see supra, at 9\u201312, knowledge or\nintent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncould or would help further terrorism simply by helping to\nlegitimate the organization is not sufficient.\n   This reading of the statute protects those who engage in\npure speech and association ordinarily protected by the\nFirst Amendment. But it does not protect that activity\nwhere a defendant purposefully intends it to help terror\nism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds him\nself to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to\nassist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these catego\nries of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist\nends, the act of providing material support to a known\nterrorist organization bears a close enough relation to\nterrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited\nnotwithstanding any First Amendment interest.              Cf.\nBrandenburg, 395 U. S. 444. At the same time, this read\ning does not require the Government to undertake the\ndifficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and\nnonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred;\nknowledge is enough. See Bailey, supra, at 405 (defining\nspecific intent).\n   This reading is consistent with the statute\u2019s text. The\nstatute prohibits \u201cknowingly provid[ing] material support\nor resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\u00a72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). Normally we read a crimi\nnal statute as applying a mens rea requirement to all of\nthe subsequently listed elements of the crime. See Flores-\nFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6\u20137). So read, the defendant would have to know or\nintend (1) that he is providing support or resources, (2)\nthat he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist\norganization, and (3) that he is providing support that is\nmaterial, meaning (4) that his support bears a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization\u2019s terrorist ends.\n   This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201cmaterial.\u201d That word can mean being of a\nphysical or worldly nature, but it also can mean \u201cbeing of\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreal importance or great consequence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1392 (1961). Here, it must\nmean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to\nphysical aid, would not apply to speech at all. See also\n\u00a72339A(b)(1) (defining \u201c \u2018material support or resources\u2019 \u201d as\n\u201cany property, tangible or intangible\u201d (emphasis added)).\nAnd if the statute applies only to support that would likely\nbe of real importance or great consequence, it must have\nimportance or consequence in respect to the organization\u2019s\nterrorist activities. That is because support that is not\nsignificantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes\nof this statute, neither has \u201cimportance\u201d nor is of \u201cgreat\nconsequence.\u201d\n   The statutory definition of \u201cmaterial support\u201d poses no\nproblem. The statute defines \u201cmaterial support\u201d through\nreference to a list of terms, including those at issue here\u2014\n\u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cexpert advice or assistance,\u201d \u201cpersonnel,\u201d and\n\u201cservice.\u201d \u00a72339B(g)(4); \u00a72339A(b)(1). Since these latter\nterms all fall under the definition of the term \u201cmaterial\nsupport,\u201d these activities fall within the statute\u2019s scope\nonly when they too are \u201cmaterial.\u201d Cf. Stevens, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S.\n1, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from\nthe term to be defined)).\n   Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that\nthe defendant knew the support was material can be read\nto require the Government to show that the defendant\nknew that the consequences of his acts had a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization\u2019s terrorist, not\njust its lawful, aims.\n   I need not decide whether this is the only possible read\ning of the statute in cases where \u201cmaterial support\u201d takes\nthe form of \u201ccurrency,\u201d \u201cproperty,\u201d \u201cmonetary instru\nments,\u201d \u201cfinancial securities,\u201d \u201cfinancial services,\u201d \u201clodg\ning,\u201d \u201csafehouses,\u201d \u201cfalse documentation or identification,\u201d\n\u201cweapons,\u201d \u201clethal substances,\u201d or \u201cexplosives,\u201d and the\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlike. \u00a72339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more\nlikely to help an organization\u2019s terrorist activities, either\ndirectly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to\nshow that an individual has provided support of those\nkinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum\ning the statute\u2019s other requirements are met). But where\nsupport consists of pure speech or association, I would\nindulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government\nwould have to prove that the defendant knew he was\nproviding support significantly likely to help the organiza\ntion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,\nthat the defendant intended the support to be so used).\n   The statute\u2019s history strongly supports this reading.\nThat history makes clear that Congress primarily sought\nto end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations\nof money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104\u2013383, at\n38, 43\u201345, 81; supra, at 8\u20139. It shows that Congress,\nwhen referring to \u201cexpert services and assistance\u201d for\nexample, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi\nble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex\npert\u2019s giving \u201cadvice\u201d that \u201cfacilitat[es] an aircraft hijack\ning\u201d or an accountant\u2019s giving \u201cadvice\u201d that will \u201cfacilitate\nthe concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi\nties.\u201d Hearing on Administration\u2019s Draft Anti-Terrorism\nAct of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).\n   And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit\ntee, told the Senate:\n     \u201cThis bill also includes provisions making it a crime to\n     knowingly provide material support to the terrorist\n     functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden\n     tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.\u201d 142\n     Cong.

S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nHe then added:\n    \u201cI am convinced we have crafted a narrow but effec\n    tive designation provision which meets these obliga\n    tions while safeguarding the freedom to associate,\n    which none of us would willingly give up.\u201d Id., at\n    S3360.\nConsistent with this view, the statute itself says:\n    \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed or applied\n    so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed un\n    der the First Amendment to the Constitution of the\n    United States.\u201d \u00a72339B(i).\n   In any event, the principle of constitutional avoidance\ndemands this interpretation. As Part II makes clear,\nthere is a \u201cserious\u201d doubt\u2014indeed, a \u201cgrave\u201d doubt\u2014about\nthe constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to\ncriminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at\n62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346\u2013348 (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there\nfore must \u201cread the statute to eliminate\u201d that constitu\ntional \u201cdoub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly\ncontrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U. S., at 78.\n   For this reason, the majority\u2019s statutory claim that\nCongress did not use the word \u201cknowingly\u201d as I would use\nit, ante, at 12\u201313, and n. 3, is beside the point. Our conse\nquent reading is consistent with the statute\u2019s text; it is\nconsistent with Congress\u2019 basic intent; it interprets but\ndoes not significantly add to what the statute otherwise\ncontains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo\ngraphs, 402 U. S. 363, 373\u2013374 (1971) (constitutionally\ncompelled to add requirement that \u201cforfeiture proceedings\nbe commenced within 14 days and completed within 60\ndays\u201d despite absence of any statutory time limits); NLRB\nv. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 507 (1979)\n22        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(constitutionally compelled to interpret \u201cemployer\u201d as\nimplicitly excluding \u201cchurch-operated schools\u201d despite\nsilence and eight other different but explicit exceptions).\nWe should adopt it.\n                              III\n   Having interpreted the statute to impose the mens rea\nrequirement just described, I would remand the cases so\nthat the lower courts could consider more specifically the\nprecise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to en\ngage and determine whether and to what extent a grant of\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. I do not\nsee why the majority does not also remand the cases for\nconsideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 activities relating to \u201cadvo\ncating\u201d for the organizations\u2019 peaceful causes. See ante, at\n19\u201320, 32\u201333.\n   The majority does not remand, apparently because it\nbelieves the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these\n\u201cadvocacy\u201d claims are too general. It adds that the plain\ntiffs did not \u201csuggest what exactly their \u2018advocacy\u2019 would\nconsist of.\u201d Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about\nthe lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and\naffidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy\nthese groups have previously engaged in and in which\nthey would like to continue to engage. See App. 56\u201363,\n78\u201387, 95\u201399, 110\u2013123.\n   Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern\nment\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 speech-related activi\nties amount to \u201cconduct\u201d and should be reviewed as such.\nGovernment Brief 44\u201357. Hence, I should think the ma\njority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect\nof the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,\ne.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U. S. 346, 357\u2013\n358 (2007); Johnson v. California 543 U. S. 499, 515\n(2005); cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware\nand must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to\nthe Executive and Legislative Branches the power to\nprovide for the national defense, and that it grants par\nticular authority to the President in matters of foreign\naffairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that\nauthority and expertise in these matters do not automati\ncally trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the pro\ntection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (\u201cWe have\nlong since made clear that a state of war is not a blank\ncheck . . . when it comes to the rights of th[is] Nation\u2019s\ncitizens\u201d). In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I\nbelieve the Court has failed to examine the Government\u2019s\njustifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist\nupon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It\nhas failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling\nends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us\nof the protection that the First Amendment demands.\n   That is why, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
