UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–876.      Argued December 8, 2009—Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioners (hereinafter Defendants)—executives of Hollinger Interna\n  tional, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company—were indicted\n  for mail fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§1341, 1346, and other federal crimes. At\n  trial, the Government pursued alternative mail-fraud theories, charg\n  ing that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently\n  paying themselves bogus “noncompetition fees”; and (2) by failing to\n  disclose those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest\n  services. Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed\n  special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury\n  voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theo\n  ries accounting for the verdict. Defendants resisted, preferring an\n  unelaborated general verdict. The Government ultimately acqui\n  esced. The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alterna\n  tive theories. As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the\n  jury, over Defendants’ timely objection, that a person commits that\n  offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a\n  co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loy\n  alty. The jury returned general verdicts of “guilty” on the mail-fraud\n  counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of\n  justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.\n     On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services\n  fraud jury instructions. Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convic\n  tions, Defendants relied on Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 312,\n  which held that a general verdict may be set aside “where the verdict\n  is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible\n  to tell which ground the jury selected.” The Seventh Circuit found no\n  infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined\n  that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not pre\n2                      BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    vail. By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms,\n    the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objec\n    tion to the instructions. Their challenge would have become moot,\n    the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms sepa\n    rating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that\n    Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud. Defendants, the\n    Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the ob\n    scurity of the jury’s verdict.\nHeld:\n    1. In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, this Court\n vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services compo\n nent of the federal mail-fraud statute, §1346, criminalizes only\n schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks. That holding\n renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.\n P. 5.\n    2. By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at\n trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions\n on appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in\n the Government-proposed special-verdict forms. The Federal Rules\n of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special ques\n tions to the jury. In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 pro\n vides for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, Rule\n 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule\n 49(b). While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they\n are informative on objections to instructions. Criminal Rule 30(d)\n provides that a “party who objects to any portion of the instructions\n or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of\n the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury\n retires to deliberate.” Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied\n with that requirement. The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a fur\n ther requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury\n instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal\n statute or criminal rule. And it placed in the prosecutor’s hands au\n thority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.\n To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, al\n though they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their re\n sistance to the Government’s special-verdict request. Criminal Rule\n 57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention. It provides: “No\n sanction . . . may be imposed for noncompliance with any require\n ment not in federal law [or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged viola\n tor was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the\n noncompliance.” Pp. 5–8.\n    3.

BLACK, JOHN A. BOULTBEE, AND MARK\n   S. KIPNIS, PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __,\nwe vacated a conviction because the indictment rested, in\npart, on an improper construction of the “honest services”\ncomponent of the federal ban on mail fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n§§1341, 1346. A similar infirmity is present in this case.\nHere, too, the Government and trial court advanced an\ninterpretation of §1346 rejected by the Court’s opinion in\nSkilling. Nevertheless, the Government urges, the convic\ntions of the defendants below, petitioners here, should be\naffirmed for an independent reason. At trial, the Govern\nment pursued alternative theories: (1) money-or-property\nfraud; and (2) honest-services fraud. To pinpoint whether\nthe jury based its verdict on money-or-property fraud, or\nhonest-services fraud, or both, the Government proposed\nspecial interrogatories to accompany the verdict. The\ndefendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general\nverdict, and the Government ultimately acquiesced in that\nstandard form of submission.\n   The Court of Appeals held that the defendants, by op\nposing the Government-suggested special interrogatories,\n2                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nforfeited their objection to the honest-services-fraud in\nstructions given to the jury. 530 F. 3d 596, 603 (CA7\n2008). We reverse that ruling. A criminal defendant, we\nhold, need not request special interrogatories, nor need he\nacquiesce in the Government’s request for discrete find\nings by the jury, in order to preserve in full a timely raised\nobjection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of\nguilt.\n                              I\n   Petitioners Conrad Black, John Boultbee, and Mark\nKipnis, as well as Peter Atkinson,1 (collectively, Defen\ndants) were leading executives of Hollinger International,\nInc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company that,\nthrough subsidiaries, owned newspapers here and abroad.\nIn 2005, the Government indicted Defendants on multiple\ncounts, of prime concern here, three counts of mail fraud\nin violation of §§1341 and 1346.2 Two theories were pur\nsued by the Government on each mail-fraud count. The\nGovernment charged that (1) Defendants stole millions\nfrom Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus\n“noncompetition fees”; and that (2) by failing to disclose\ntheir receipt of those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger\nof their honest services as managers of the company. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 24a–54a.\n   At the close of the four-month trial, the U. S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois instructed the\njury, discretely, on the theft-of-money-or-property and\n——————\n   1 Peter Atkinson is a respondent in support of petitioners who quali\n\nfies for relief under this Court’s Rule 12.6. See Letter from Michael S.\nSchachter to the Clerk of Court (July 29, 2009).\n   2 Section 1341 criminalizes use of the mails to further “any scheme or\n\nartifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false\nor fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” Section 1346\ndefines the §1341 term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include “a\nscheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest\nservices.”\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

As to the latter, the District\nCourt informed the jury, over Defendants’ objection, that a\nperson commits honest-services fraud if he “misuse[s] his\nposition for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer”\nand “knowingly and intentionally breache[s] his duty of\nloyalty.” Id., at 235a–236a.\n  Before jury deliberations began, the Government asked\nthe District Court to employ a special-verdict form, which\nwould reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on\na mail-fraud count, the theory or theories accounting for\nthe verdict—money-or-property fraud, honest-services\nfraud, or both. See App. 430a.3 Defendants opposed the\nGovernment-proposed special interrogatories and urged,\ninstead, standard general-verdict forms. Id., at 432a.\nComprehending, however, that in the event of a guilty\nverdict, “the jury’s specification of the [mail-]fraud theory\nmight [aid] appellate review,” ibid., Defendants proposed\nan accommodation: Upon return of a guilty verdict on any\nmail-fraud count, jurors could be asked to specify the\ntheory on which they relied, id., at 433a.\n  The Government objected to special interrogatories\npresented to the jury postverdict, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n222a, and the District Court declined to adopt that proce\ndure, id., at 225a.4 When the court rejected postverdict\n——————\n  3 The Government proposed this language for each defendant on each\n\nmail-fraud count:\n  “If you find the defendant . . . Guilty with respect to [this Count], you\nmust answer the following question by checking the applicable lines.\n  “With respect to [this Count], we, the jury, find the following has\nbeen proven beyond a reasonable doubt (check all that apply):\n  “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its\nshareholders of money or property ____\n  “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its\nshareholders of their intangible right to honest services ____.” App.\n430a.\n  4 In her years at the bar and on the bench, the trial judge commented,\n4                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ninterrogatories, the Government represented that it would\nnot object to submission of the mail-fraud counts for jury\ndecision by general verdict. Id., at 228a. The jury re\nturned general verdicts of “guilty” on the three mail-fraud\ncounts;5 it also found defendant Black guilty of obstruction\nof justice in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1512(c)(1), and it\nacquitted Defendants on all other charges.\n  On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the jury\ninstructions on honest-services fraud. Under the rule\ndeclared by this Court in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S.\n298, 312 (1957), a general verdict may be set aside “where\nthe verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on an\nother, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury\nselected.” Relying on that rule, Defendants urged reversal\nof their mail-fraud convictions. The Court of Appeals\nfound no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, 530\nF. 3d, at 600–602, but further determined that Defendants\ncould not prevail even if those instructions were wrong,\nid., at 602–603. For this determination, the court homed\nin on the Government’s special-verdict proposal.\n  The challenge to the honest-services instructions would\nhave become moot, the court observed, had the jury re\nceived special-verdict forms separating money-or-property\nfraud from honest-services fraud, and reported on the\nforms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services\nfraud. Defendants, the Court of Appeals reasoned, bore\nresponsibility for the obscurity of the jury’s verdict. True,\nthe court acknowledged, it was not incumbent on Defen\ndants to request special verdicts. But by resisting the\nGovernment’s proposal for separate findings on money-or\nproperty fraud and on honest-services fraud, and request\n\n——————\nshe had “absolutely” never seen the postverdict procedure used. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 225a.\n  5 The District Court later granted Kipnis’ motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal on one of these counts.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ning general verdicts instead, the Seventh Circuit con\ncluded, Defendants had “forfeited their objection to the\n[honest-services] instruction[s].” Id., at 603. Defendants’\nsuggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the\nCourt of Appeals’ view, overcome the forfeiture, for\n“[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down\ntheir verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one\nthat a district judge is required to employ.” Ibid.6\n   We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U. S. ___ (2009),\nalong with Skilling v. United States, 558 U. S. ___ (2009),\nand Weyhrauch v. United States, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), to\ndetermine what conduct Congress rendered criminal by\nproscribing, in §1346, fraudulent deprivation of “the in\ntangible right of honest services.” We also agreed to con\nsider in this case the question whether Defendants for\nfeited their objection to the honest-services jury\ninstructions by opposing the Government’s request for\nspecial verdicts.\n                                II\n  We decided in Skilling that §1346, properly confined,\ncriminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or\nkickbacks. See ante, p. __. That holding renders the\nhonest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,7\nand brings squarely before us the question presented by\nthe Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by\nfailing to acquiesce in the Government’s request for spe\ncial verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to\nthe honest-services instructions?\n——————\n  6 See, e.g., Jacobs Mfg. Co. v. Sam Brown Co., 19 F. 3d 1259, 1267\n(CA8 1994) (“Postverdict interrogatories may imply the jury’s verdict is\nunjustified and cause the jury to answer the interrogatories in a man\nner inconsistent with the verdict.”); cf. Yeager v. United States, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (“Courts properly avoid . . . explora\ntions into the jury’s sovereign space.”).\n   7 The scheme to defraud alleged here did not involve any bribes or\n\nkickbacks.\n6                     BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In addressing this issue, we note first the absence of any\nprovision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nsubmission of special questions to the jury. See Stein v.\nNew York, 346 U. S. 156, 178 (1953) (“Our own Rules of\nCriminal Procedure make no provision for anything but a\ngeneral verdict.”), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v.\nDenno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964).8 The sole call for special\nfindings in the Criminal Rules concerns nonjury trials.\nRule 23(c) provides: “If a party [in a case tried without a\njury] requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty, the\ncourt must state its specific findings of fact in open court\nor in a written decision or opinion.”\n   In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide\nfor jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts,\nwhich instruct the jury to return “a special written finding\non each issue of fact,” Rule 49(a); and general verdicts\nwith answers to “written questions on one or more issues\nof fact,” Rule 49(b).9 Although not dispositive,10 the ab\nsence of a Criminal Rule authorizing special verdicts\ncounsels caution.11\n——————\n    8 The absence of a special verdict or interrogatory provision in the\nCriminal Rules is hardly accidental. See Skidmore v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 167 F. 2d 54, 70 (CA2 1948) (L. Hand, J., concurring) (“I should\nlike to subject a verdict, as narrowly as was practical, to a review which\nshould make it in fact, what we very elaborately pretend that it should\nbe: a decision based upon law. In criminal prosecutions there may be,\nand in my judgment there are, other considerations which intervene to\nmake such an attempt undesirable.”).\n   9 Although the special interrogatories requested by the Government\n\nin this case have been called “special verdicts” by the parties and the\ncourts below, they more closely resemble what Civil Rule 49(b) de\nscribes as “general verdict[s] with answers to written questions.”\n(Capitalization omitted.)\n   10 See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 57(b) (when there is no controlling law,\n\n“[a] judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal\nlaw, these rules, and the local rules of the district”).\n   11 By calling for caution, we do not mean to suggest that special ver\n\ndicts in criminal cases are never appropriate. See United States v.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts,\nthey are informative on objections to instructions. Rule\n30(d) “clarifies what . . . counsel must do to preserve a\nclaim of error regarding an instruction.” Advisory Com\nmittee’s Notes on 2002 Amendment on Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 30(d), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 915. The Rule provides: “A\nparty who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a\nfailure to give a requested instruction must inform the\ncourt of the specific objection and the grounds for the\nobjection before the jury retires to deliberate.” Defendants\nhere, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.12\n  The Court of Appeals, in essence, added a further re\nquirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to\njury instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction un\nmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule. And it\nplaced in the prosecutor’s hands authority to trigger the\nsanction simply by requesting a special verdict. See 530\n——————\nRuggiero, 726 F. 2d 913, 922–923 (CA2 1984) (in complex Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act cases, “it can be extremely\nuseful for a trial judge to request the jury to record their specific\ndispositions of the separate predicate acts charged, in addition to their\nverdict of guilty or innocence”); id., at 927 (Newman, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (“[A] District Court should have the discre\ntion to use a jury interrogatory in cases where risk of prejudice to the\ndefendant is slight and the advantage of securing particularized fact\nfinding is substantial.”).\n   12 The Government asserts that Defendants’ opposition to a special\n\nverdict resulted in forfeiture not of their jury-instruction objection, but\nof their “Yates argument” that any instructional error may “requir[e]\nreversal.” Brief for United States 52, and n. 21 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Government thus appears to concede that Defen\ndants preserved their instructional challenge, but maintains that they\nare powerless to ask a court to assess the prejudicial effect of any error\nthey may be able to demonstrate. See Reply Brief 29, n. 10 (on Gov\nernment’s view, “[Defendants] could still ‘claim’ they were wrongly\nconvicted, they just could not ask a court to do anything about it”). We\nsee little merit in the Government’s attempt to divorce preservation of\na claim from preservation of the right to redress should the claim\nsucceed.\n8                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 3d, at 603.13 To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the\nsanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice\nthat forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Gov\nernment’s special-verdict request. There is a Rule de\nsigned to ward off judicial invention of the kind present\nhere. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admon\nishes: “No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed\nfor noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law\n[or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged violator was fur\nnished with actual notice of the requirement before the\nnoncompliance.”\n  We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the\nhonest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants\nsecured their right to challenge those instructions on\nappeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to\nacquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict\nforms. Our decision in Skilling makes it plain that the\nhonest-services instructions in this case were indeed\nincorrect. As in Skilling, ante, at 40–41, we express no\nopinion on the question whether the error was ultimately\nharmless, but leave that matter for consideration on\nremand.14\n                        *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n    13 Renderingthe Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling all the more\nanomalous, at the time the trial court settled on the general verdict\nform, the Government was no longer pressing its special-verdict re\nquest. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 228a.\n  14 Black contends that spillover prejudice from evidence introduced on\n\nthe mail-fraud counts requires reversal of his obstruction-of-justice\nconviction.

First, I\ndo not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the\nAdvisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed\neral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s\nview is not authoritative. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere\nS. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The\nCourt accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7,\nthe meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said.\n  Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the\nDistrict Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the\njury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In\nmy view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently\nwith the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill\ning v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the\njury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set\nforth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un\nconstitutionally vague.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–876.      Argued December 8, 2009—Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioners (hereinafter Defendants)—executives of Hollinger Interna\n  tional, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company—were indicted\n  for mail fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§1341, 1346, and other federal crimes. At\n  trial, the Government pursued alternative mail-fraud theories, charg\n  ing that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently\n  paying themselves bogus “noncompetition fees”; and (2) by failing to\n  disclose those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest\n  services. Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed\n  special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury\n  voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theo\n  ries accounting for the verdict. Defendants resisted, preferring an\n  unelaborated general verdict. The Government ultimately acqui\n  esced. The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alterna\n  tive theories. As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the\n  jury, over Defendants’ timely objection, that a person commits that\n  offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a\n  co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loy\n  alty. The jury returned general verdicts of “guilty” on the mail-fraud\n  counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of\n  justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.\n     On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services\n  fraud jury instructions. Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convic\n  tions, Defendants relied on Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 312,\n  which held that a general verdict may be set aside “where the verdict\n  is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible\n  to tell which ground the jury selected.” The Seventh Circuit found no\n  infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined\n  that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not pre\n2                      BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    vail. By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms,\n    the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objec\n    tion to the instructions. Their challenge would have become moot,\n    the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms sepa\n    rating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that\n    Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud. Defendants, the\n    Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the ob\n    scurity of the jury’s verdict.\nHeld:\n    1. In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __, this Court\n vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services compo\n nent of the federal mail-fraud statute, §1346, criminalizes only\n schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks. That holding\n renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.\n P. 5.\n    2. By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at\n trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions\n on appeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in\n the Government-proposed special-verdict forms. The Federal Rules\n of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special ques\n tions to the jury. In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 pro\n vides for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, Rule\n 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule\n 49(b). While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they\n are informative on objections to instructions. Criminal Rule 30(d)\n provides that a “party who objects to any portion of the instructions\n or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of\n the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury\n retires to deliberate.” Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied\n with that requirement. The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a fur\n ther requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury\n instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal\n statute or criminal rule. And it placed in the prosecutor’s hands au\n thority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.\n To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, al\n though they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their re\n sistance to the Government’s special-verdict request. Criminal Rule\n 57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention. It provides: “No\n sanction . . . may be imposed for noncompliance with any require\n ment not in federal law [or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged viola\n tor was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the\n noncompliance.” Pp. 5–8.\n    3.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In Skilling v. United States, decided today, ante, p. __,\nwe vacated a conviction because the indictment rested, in\npart, on an improper construction of the “honest services”\ncomponent of the federal ban on mail fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n§§1341, 1346. A similar infirmity is present in this case.\nHere, too, the Government and trial court advanced an\ninterpretation of §1346 rejected by the Court’s opinion in\nSkilling. Nevertheless, the Government urges, the convic\ntions of the defendants below, petitioners here, should be\naffirmed for an independent reason. At trial, the Govern\nment pursued alternative theories: (1) money-or-property\nfraud; and (2) honest-services fraud. To pinpoint whether\nthe jury based its verdict on money-or-property fraud, or\nhonest-services fraud, or both, the Government proposed\nspecial interrogatories to accompany the verdict. The\ndefendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general\nverdict, and the Government ultimately acquiesced in that\nstandard form of submission.\n   The Court of Appeals held that the defendants, by op\nposing the Government-suggested special interrogatories,\n2                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nforfeited their objection to the honest-services-fraud in\nstructions given to the jury. 530 F. 3d 596, 603 (CA7\n2008). We reverse that ruling. A criminal defendant, we\nhold, need not request special interrogatories, nor need he\nacquiesce in the Government’s request for discrete find\nings by the jury, in order to preserve in full a timely raised\nobjection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of\nguilt.\n                              I\n   Petitioners Conrad Black, John Boultbee, and Mark\nKipnis, as well as Peter Atkinson,1 (collectively, Defen\ndants) were leading executives of Hollinger International,\nInc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company that,\nthrough subsidiaries, owned newspapers here and abroad.\nIn 2005, the Government indicted Defendants on multiple\ncounts, of prime concern here, three counts of mail fraud\nin violation of §§1341 and 1346.2 Two theories were pur\nsued by the Government on each mail-fraud count. The\nGovernment charged that (1) Defendants stole millions\nfrom Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus\n“noncompetition fees”; and that (2) by failing to disclose\ntheir receipt of those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger\nof their honest services as managers of the company. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 24a–54a.\n   At the close of the four-month trial, the U. S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois instructed the\njury, discretely, on the theft-of-money-or-property and\n——————\n   1 Peter Atkinson is a respondent in support of petitioners who quali\n\nfies for relief under this Court’s Rule 12.6. See Letter from Michael S.\nSchachter to the Clerk of Court (July 29, 2009).\n   2 Section 1341 criminalizes use of the mails to further “any scheme or\n\nartifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false\nor fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” Section 1346\ndefines the §1341 term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include “a\nscheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest\nservices.”\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

As to the latter, the District\nCourt informed the jury, over Defendants’ objection, that a\nperson commits honest-services fraud if he “misuse[s] his\nposition for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer”\nand “knowingly and intentionally breache[s] his duty of\nloyalty.” Id., at 235a–236a.\n  Before jury deliberations began, the Government asked\nthe District Court to employ a special-verdict form, which\nwould reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on\na mail-fraud count, the theory or theories accounting for\nthe verdict—money-or-property fraud, honest-services\nfraud, or both. See App. 430a.3 Defendants opposed the\nGovernment-proposed special interrogatories and urged,\ninstead, standard general-verdict forms. Id., at 432a.\nComprehending, however, that in the event of a guilty\nverdict, “the jury’s specification of the [mail-]fraud theory\nmight [aid] appellate review,” ibid., Defendants proposed\nan accommodation: Upon return of a guilty verdict on any\nmail-fraud count, jurors could be asked to specify the\ntheory on which they relied, id., at 433a.\n  The Government objected to special interrogatories\npresented to the jury postverdict, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n222a, and the District Court declined to adopt that proce\ndure, id., at 225a.4 When the court rejected postverdict\n——————\n  3 The Government proposed this language for each defendant on each\n\nmail-fraud count:\n  “If you find the defendant . . . Guilty with respect to [this Count], you\nmust answer the following question by checking the applicable lines.\n  “With respect to [this Count], we, the jury, find the following has\nbeen proven beyond a reasonable doubt (check all that apply):\n  “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its\nshareholders of money or property ____\n  “Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud [Hollinger] and its\nshareholders of their intangible right to honest services ____.” App.\n430a.\n  4 In her years at the bar and on the bench, the trial judge commented,\n4                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ninterrogatories, the Government represented that it would\nnot object to submission of the mail-fraud counts for jury\ndecision by general verdict. Id., at 228a. The jury re\nturned general verdicts of “guilty” on the three mail-fraud\ncounts;5 it also found defendant Black guilty of obstruction\nof justice in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1512(c)(1), and it\nacquitted Defendants on all other charges.\n  On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the jury\ninstructions on honest-services fraud. Under the rule\ndeclared by this Court in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S.\n298, 312 (1957), a general verdict may be set aside “where\nthe verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on an\nother, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury\nselected.” Relying on that rule, Defendants urged reversal\nof their mail-fraud convictions. The Court of Appeals\nfound no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, 530\nF. 3d, at 600–602, but further determined that Defendants\ncould not prevail even if those instructions were wrong,\nid., at 602–603. For this determination, the court homed\nin on the Government’s special-verdict proposal.\n  The challenge to the honest-services instructions would\nhave become moot, the court observed, had the jury re\nceived special-verdict forms separating money-or-property\nfraud from honest-services fraud, and reported on the\nforms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services\nfraud. Defendants, the Court of Appeals reasoned, bore\nresponsibility for the obscurity of the jury’s verdict. True,\nthe court acknowledged, it was not incumbent on Defen\ndants to request special verdicts. But by resisting the\nGovernment’s proposal for separate findings on money-or\nproperty fraud and on honest-services fraud, and request\n\n——————\nshe had “absolutely” never seen the postverdict procedure used.

Defendants’\nsuggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the\nCourt of Appeals’ view, overcome the forfeiture, for\n“[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down\ntheir verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one\nthat a district judge is required to employ.” Ibid.6\n   We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U. S. ___ (2009),\nalong with Skilling v. United States, 558 U. S. ___ (2009),\nand Weyhrauch v. United States, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), to\ndetermine what conduct Congress rendered criminal by\nproscribing, in §1346, fraudulent deprivation of “the in\ntangible right of honest services.” We also agreed to con\nsider in this case the question whether Defendants for\nfeited their objection to the honest-services jury\ninstructions by opposing the Government’s request for\nspecial verdicts.\n                                II\n  We decided in Skilling that §1346, properly confined,\ncriminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or\nkickbacks. See ante, p. __. That holding renders the\nhonest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,7\nand brings squarely before us the question presented by\nthe Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by\nfailing to acquiesce in the Government’s request for spe\ncial verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to\nthe honest-services instructions?\n——————\n  6 See, e.g., Jacobs Mfg. Co. v. Sam Brown Co., 19 F. 3d 1259, 1267\n(CA8 1994) (“Postverdict interrogatories may imply the jury’s verdict is\nunjustified and cause the jury to answer the interrogatories in a man\nner inconsistent with the verdict.”); cf. Yeager v. United States, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (“Courts properly avoid . . . explora\ntions into the jury’s sovereign space.”).\n   7 The scheme to defraud alleged here did not involve any bribes or\n\nkickbacks.\n6                     BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In addressing this issue, we note first the absence of any\nprovision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nsubmission of special questions to the jury. See Stein v.\nNew York, 346 U. S. 156, 178 (1953) (“Our own Rules of\nCriminal Procedure make no provision for anything but a\ngeneral verdict.”), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v.\nDenno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964).8 The sole call for special\nfindings in the Criminal Rules concerns nonjury trials.\nRule 23(c) provides: “If a party [in a case tried without a\njury] requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty, the\ncourt must state its specific findings of fact in open court\nor in a written decision or opinion.”\n   In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide\nfor jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts,\nwhich instruct the jury to return “a special written finding\non each issue of fact,” Rule 49(a); and general verdicts\nwith answers to “written questions on one or more issues\nof fact,” Rule 49(b).9 Although not dispositive,10 the ab\nsence of a Criminal Rule authorizing special verdicts\ncounsels caution.11\n——————\n    8 The absence of a special verdict or interrogatory provision in the\nCriminal Rules is hardly accidental. See Skidmore v. Baltimore & Ohio\nR. Co., 167 F. 2d 54, 70 (CA2 1948) (L. Hand, J., concurring) (“I should\nlike to subject a verdict, as narrowly as was practical, to a review which\nshould make it in fact, what we very elaborately pretend that it should\nbe: a decision based upon law. In criminal prosecutions there may be,\nand in my judgment there are, other considerations which intervene to\nmake such an attempt undesirable.”).\n   9 Although the special interrogatories requested by the Government\n\nin this case have been called “special verdicts” by the parties and the\ncourts below, they more closely resemble what Civil Rule 49(b) de\nscribes as “general verdict[s] with answers to written questions.”\n(Capitalization omitted.)\n   10 See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 57(b) (when there is no controlling law,\n\n“[a] judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal\nlaw, these rules, and the local rules of the district”).\n   11 By calling for caution, we do not mean to suggest that special ver\n\ndicts in criminal cases are never appropriate. See United States v.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts,\nthey are informative on objections to instructions. Rule\n30(d) “clarifies what . . . counsel must do to preserve a\nclaim of error regarding an instruction.” Advisory Com\nmittee’s Notes on 2002 Amendment on Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 30(d), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 915. The Rule provides: “A\nparty who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a\nfailure to give a requested instruction must inform the\ncourt of the specific objection and the grounds for the\nobjection before the jury retires to deliberate.” Defendants\nhere, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.12\n  The Court of Appeals, in essence, added a further re\nquirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to\njury instructions. It devised a forfeiture sanction un\nmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule. And it\nplaced in the prosecutor’s hands authority to trigger the\nsanction simply by requesting a special verdict. See 530\n——————\nRuggiero, 726 F. 2d 913, 922–923 (CA2 1984) (in complex Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act cases, “it can be extremely\nuseful for a trial judge to request the jury to record their specific\ndispositions of the separate predicate acts charged, in addition to their\nverdict of guilty or innocence”); id., at 927 (Newman, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (“[A] District Court should have the discre\ntion to use a jury interrogatory in cases where risk of prejudice to the\ndefendant is slight and the advantage of securing particularized fact\nfinding is substantial.”).\n   12 The Government asserts that Defendants’ opposition to a special\n\nverdict resulted in forfeiture not of their jury-instruction objection, but\nof their “Yates argument” that any instructional error may “requir[e]\nreversal.” Brief for United States 52, and n. 21 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Government thus appears to concede that Defen\ndants preserved their instructional challenge, but maintains that they\nare powerless to ask a court to assess the prejudicial effect of any error\nthey may be able to demonstrate. See Reply Brief 29, n. 10 (on Gov\nernment’s view, “[Defendants] could still ‘claim’ they were wrongly\nconvicted, they just could not ask a court to do anything about it”). We\nsee little merit in the Government’s attempt to divorce preservation of\na claim from preservation of the right to redress should the claim\nsucceed.\n8                    BLACK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 3d, at 603.13 To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the\nsanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice\nthat forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Gov\nernment’s special-verdict request. There is a Rule de\nsigned to ward off judicial invention of the kind present\nhere. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admon\nishes: “No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed\nfor noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law\n[or] federal rules . . . unless the alleged violator was fur\nnished with actual notice of the requirement before the\nnoncompliance.”\n  We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the\nhonest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants\nsecured their right to challenge those instructions on\nappeal. They did not forfeit that right by declining to\nacquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict\nforms. Our decision in Skilling makes it plain that the\nhonest-services instructions in this case were indeed\nincorrect. As in Skilling, ante, at 40–41, we express no\nopinion on the question whether the error was ultimately\nharmless, but leave that matter for consideration on\nremand.14\n                        *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n    13 Renderingthe Seventh Circuit’s forfeiture ruling all the more\nanomalous, at the time the trial court settled on the general verdict\nform, the Government was no longer pressing its special-verdict re\nquest. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 228a.\n  14 Black contends that spillover prejudice from evidence introduced on\n\nthe mail-fraud counts requires reversal of his obstruction-of-justice\nconviction. Brief for Petitioners 47–49. That question, too, is one on\nwhich we express no opinion.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

First, I\ndo not join in its reliance, ante, at 7, on the Notes of the\nAdvisory Committee in determining the meaning of Fed\neral Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). The Committee’s\nview is not authoritative. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere\nS. p. A., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). The\nCourt accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see ante, at 7,\nthe meaning of which is obvious. No more should be said.\n  Second, I agree with the Court, ante, at 5, 8, that the\nDistrict Court’s honest-services-fraud instructions to the\njury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason. In\nmy view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently\nwith the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in Skill\ning v. United States, ante, p. ___, but in instructing the\njury on honest-services fraud at all. For the reasons set\nforth in my opinion in that case, 18 U. S. C. §1346 is un\nconstitutionally vague.
