UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–1394. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nFounded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in\n  Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company\n  in America. Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was\n  Enron’s chief executive officer from February until August 2001,\n  when he resigned. Less than four months later, Enron crashed into\n  bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value. After an investigation\n  uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron’s stock prices by\n  overstating the company’s financial well-being, the Government\n  prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the\n  scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of\n  command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.\n  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme\n  to deceive investors about Enron’s true financial performance by ma\n  nipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false\n  and misleading statements. Count 1 of the indictment charged Skill\n  ing with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire\n  fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its\n  shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services. Skilling\n  was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud,\n  wire fraud, making false representations to Enron’s auditors, and in\n  sider trading.\n     In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contend\n  ing that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pre\n  trial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. He submitted hundreds\n  of news reports detailing Enron’s downfall, as well as affidavits from\n  experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in\n  comparison to other potential venues. The District Court denied the\n  motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presump\n2                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\n    Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed,\n    media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional,\n    and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational. More\n    over, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.\n       In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for ques\n    tions it might use to screen prospective jurors. Rejecting the Gov\n    ernment’s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling’s more probing and\n    specific questions, the court converted Skilling’s submission, with\n    slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document. The\n    questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news\n    and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron\n    and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and\n    their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\n    and to anyone affected by its demise. The court then mailed the\n    questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from\n    nearly all of them. It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 indi\n    viduals, and the parties, with the court’s approval, further winnowed\n    the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical dis\n    ability. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospec\n    tive juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the de\n    fendants would prevent her from being impartial.\n       In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skill\n    ing’s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty. Skilling re\n    newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror question\n    naires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey’s\n    guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. The court again declined to\n    move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided\n    safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. The court also de\n    nied Skilling’s request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that\n    potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with law\n    yers. But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask\n    follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined\n    individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants\n    jointly two extra peremptory challenges.\n       Voir dire began in January 2006. After questioning the venire as a\n    group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking\n    each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any\n    stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers\n    that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permit\n    ted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties’\n    challenges for cause. Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective\n    jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to\n    empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates. After a 4-month trial, the jury\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud\n  conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.\n     On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here. First, he\n  contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented\n  him from obtaining a fair trial. Second, he alleged that the jury im\n  properly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire\n  fraud. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that\n  the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron’s\n  collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. Stating, however,\n  that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire,\n  found it “proper and thorough,” and held that the District Court had\n  empaneled an impartial jury. The Court of Appeals also rejected\n  Skilling’s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to\n  commit honest-services fraud. It did not address Skilling’s argument\n  that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his ac\n  tions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.\nHeld:\n    1. Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skill\n ing from obtaining a fair trial. He did not establish that a presump\n tion of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\n tried him. Pp. 11–34.\n       (a) The District Court did not err in denying Skilling’s requests\n for a venue transfer. Pp. 11–19.\n         (1) Although the Sixth Amendment and Art. III, §2, cl. 3, pro\n vide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was\n committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer\n of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice\n will prevent a fair trial. Pp. 11–12.\n         (2) The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice\n from which the Fifth Circuit’s analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisi\n ana, 373 U. S. 723. Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kid\n naped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interro\n gated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his\n confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised\n three times to large local audiences shortly before trial. After the\n Louisiana trial court denied Rideau’s change-of-venue motion, he was\n convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal. This\n Court reversed. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and\n heard it,” the Court explained, the interrogation “in a very real sense\n was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded guilty.”             Id., at 726.\n “[W]ithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire,” the Court held that\n the “kangaroo court proceedings” trailing the televised confession vio\n lated due process. Id., at 726–727. The Court followed Rideau in two\n other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal\n4                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    prosecutions. However, it later explained that those decisions “can\n    not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . .\n    news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the de\n    fendant of due process.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798–799.\n    Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror\n    impartiality does not require ignorance. See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366\n    U. S. 717, 722. A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme\n    case. Pp. 12–16.\n           (3) Important differences separate Skilling’s prosecution from\n    those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice. First, the\n    Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community\n    in which the crime occurred. In contrast to the small-town setting in\n    Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation’s\n    fourth most populous city. Given the large, diverse pool of residents\n    eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals\n    could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain. Second, al\n    though news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no\n    blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau’s dramatically\n    staged admission of guilt. Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in\n    which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years\n    elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skilling’s trial. Although\n    reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the\n    decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years\n    following Enron’s collapse. Finally, and of prime significance, Skill\n    ing’s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly,\n    earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelm\n    ing victory for the Government. It would be odd for an appellate\n    court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors’ actions run\n    counter to that presumption. Pp. 16–18.\n           (4) The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily\n    on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed\n    at Enron. But “pretrial publicity—even pervasive, adverse public\n    ity—does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press\n    Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554. Here, news stories about Enron\n    did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court\n    has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Hous\n    ton’s size and diversity diluted the media’s impact. Nor did Enron’s\n    sheer number of victims trigger a presumption. Although the wide\n    spread community impact necessitated careful identification and in\n    spection of prospective jurors’ connections to Enron, the extensive\n    screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose\n    links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated. Finally, while\n    Causey’s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial\n    created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropri\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nate steps to mitigate that risk. Pp. 18–19.\n     (b) No actual prejudice contaminated Skilling’s jury. The Court\nrejects Skilling’s assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect\nand defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.\nPp. 20–34.\n       (1) No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or\nbreadth of voir dire. Jury selection is “particularly within the prov\nince of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594–595.\nWhen pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, “primary reliance on\nthe judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense” be\ncause the judge “sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have\nhad its effect” and may base her evaluation on her “own perception of\nthe depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.”\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427. The Court considers the ade\nquacy of jury selection in Skilling’s case attentive to the respect due\nto district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the\nmeasures necessary to ensure that impartiality. Pp. 20–21.\n       (2) Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of consti\ntutional requirements. The jury-selection process was insufficient,\nSkilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of\nthe District Court’s questions were conclusory and failed adequately\nto probe jurors’ true feelings, and the court consistently took prospec\ntive jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no mat\nter any other indications of bias. This Court’s review of the record,\nhowever, yields a different appraisal. The District Court initially\nscreened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehen\nsive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey\nhelped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served\nas a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmi\nnation of a lengthy process. Moreover, inspection of the question\nnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstand\ning the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors\nlargely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the\ncorporation’s collapse. Whatever community prejudice existed in\nHouston generally, Skilling’s jurors were not under its sway. Relying\non Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727–728, Skilling asserts the District\nCourt should not have accepted jurors’ promises of fairness. But a\nnumber of factors show that the District Court had far less reason\nthan the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors’ assurances of imparti\nality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the\nhorrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin’s rampage of\nrobberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the ru\nral community in which Irvin’s trial proceeded; circulation figures for\nHouston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n6                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    recorded in Irvin; and Skilling’s seated jurors exhibited nothing like\n    the display of bias shown in Irvin. In any event, the District Court\n    did not simply take venire members at their word. It questioned\n    each juror individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face\n    opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with informa\n    tion from the questionnaires regarding jurors’ backgrounds, opinions,\n    and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fit\n    ness for jury service. Pp. 22–30.\n            (3) Skilling’s allegation that several jurors were openly biased\n    also fails. In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district\n    courts is at its pinnacle: “ ‘A trial court’s findings of juror impartiality\n    may be overturned only for manifest error.’ ” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at\n    428. Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the\n    seated jurors for cause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the\n    [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to\n    his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558. A review of\n    the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Ju\n    rors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she\n    would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove\n    its case. Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded\n    with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no\n    signs of prejudice this Court can discern. Pp. 31–34.\n       2. Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of “the\n    intangible right of honest services,” is properly confined to cover only\n    bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged misconduct\n    entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Court’s con\n    finement of §1346’s proscription. Pp. 34–51.\n          (a) To place Skilling’s claim that §1346 is unconstitutionally\n    vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent appli\n    cation of the honest-services doctrine. Pp. 34–38.\n            (1) In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts\n    of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statute’s\n    prohibition of “any scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depriva\n    tions not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.\n    See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110, which stimulated\n    the development of the “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike traditional\n    fraud, in which the victim’s loss of money or property supplied the de\n    fendant’s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest\n    services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.\n    While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no depriva\n    tion of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been\n    deceived, provided the enrichment. Even if the scheme occasioned a\n    money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, ac\n    tionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to the offender’s\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“honest services.” Most often these cases involved bribery of public\nofficials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the\ndoctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to\nhis employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all\nCourts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.\nPp. 34–37.\n        (2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi\nble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,\nwhich held that the mail-fraud statute was “limited in scope to the\nprotection of property rights.” “If Congress desires to go further,” the\nCourt stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid. P. 37.\n        (3) Congress responded the next year by enacting §1346, which\nprovides: “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that\nprohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the\nterm ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” Pp 37–38.\n     (b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti\ntutionally vague. Pp. 38–51.\n        (1) To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people\ncan understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that\ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc\ntrine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that §1346\nmeets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,\nif possible, construe, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to\n§1346’s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how\nbest to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined\nto throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees\nthat §1346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38–39.\n        (2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally\ncases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “the in\ntangible right of honest services.” There is no doubt that Congress\nintended §1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc\ntrine recognized in Courts of Appeals’ decisions before McNally de\nrailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em\nphasis, enacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.\nPp. 39–40.\n        (3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended §1346 to\ncover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its\ncore: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes\nto deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks\n8                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. In parsing the\n    various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skill\n    ing’s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\n    were not models of clarity or consistency. It has long been the\n    Court’s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as imper\n    missibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a\n    limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n    657. Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends\n    that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core be\n    cause the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.\n    This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers,\n    413 U. S., at 571–572. Although some applications of the pre-\n    McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the\n    Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast\n    majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary\n    duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. Indeed, McNally\n    itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U. S., at\n    352–353, 360. In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress\n    intended §1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Because read\n    ing the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would\n    raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that §1346 criminalizes\n    only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.\n    Pp. 41–45.\n            (4) The Government urges the Court to go further by reading\n    §1346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self\n    dealing by a public official or private employee. Neither of the Gov\n    ernment’s arguments in support of this position withstands close in\n    spection. Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on non\n    disclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a\n    classic kickback scheme. See 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. Reading\n    §1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—\n    satisfies Congress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n    Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government’s argument that the\n    pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of\n    the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\n    honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they\n    reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. Given the relative\n    infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies\n    they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting con\n    struction of §1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.\n    Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that “ambigu\n    ity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in\n    favor of lenity.” Cleveland v.

S., at 360. Pp. 45–47.\n          (5) Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\n  schemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. A prohibition on\n  fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest services by accepting\n  bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary\n  prosecution problem. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. As to fair no\n  tice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute\n  honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101,\n  and the statute’s mens rea requirement further blunts any notice\n  concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104. As\n  to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that\n  the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out\n  of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not\n  only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes\n  proscribing and defining similar crimes. Pp. 48–49.\n       (c) Skilling did not violate §1346, as the Court interprets the\n  statute. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to de\n  fraud Enron’s shareholders by misrepresenting the company’s fiscal\n  health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he\n  solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for\n  making these misrepresentations. Because the indictment alleged\n  three objects of the conspiracy—honest-services wire fraud, money\n  or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud—Skilling’s conviction is\n  flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298. This determina\n  tion, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy\n  conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless\n  error analysis. The Court leaves the parties’ dispute about whether\n  the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the\n  question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of\n  Skilling’s other convictions.

SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED \n\n                    STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest­\nrevenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bank­\nruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising\nfrom the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron\nexecutive, for crimes committed before the corporation’s\ncollapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community\nprejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?\nSecond, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of con­\nspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n§§371, 1343, 1346?\n   Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit af­\nfirmed Skilling’s convictions. We conclude, in common\nwith the Court of Appeals, that Skilling’s fair-trial argu­\nment fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a\npresumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias\ninfected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the\nFifth Circuit’s honest-services ruling.      In proscribing\nfraudulent deprivations of “the intangible right of honest\nservices,” §1346, Congress intended at least to reach\nschemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Con­\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstruing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that\ncore meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness\nshoal. We therefore hold that §1346 covers only bribery\nand kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged miscon­\nduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within\n§1346’s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and\nvacate in part.\n                              I\n   Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its\nheadquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world’s\nleading energy companies. Skilling launched his career\nthere in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company’s founder,\nhired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily\nrose through the corporation’s ranks, serving as president\nand chief operating officer, and then, beginning in Febru­\nary 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on\nAugust 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.\n   Less than four months after Skilling’s departure, Enron\nspiraled into bankruptcy. The company’s stock, which had\ntraded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to\npennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend\nwhat caused the corporation’s collapse, the U. S. Depart­\nment of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising\nprosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The\nGovernment’s investigation uncovered an elaborate con­\nspiracy to prop up Enron’s short-run stock prices by over­\nstating the company’s financial well-being. In the years\nfollowing Enron’s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted\ndozens of Enron employees who participated in the\nscheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the\ncorporation’s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand\njury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron’s\nformer chief accounting officer.\n   These three defendants, the indictment alleged,\n    “engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the in­\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

To support this assertion, Skill­\ning, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news\nreports detailing Enron’s downfall; he also presented\naffidavits from the experts he engaged portraying commu­\nnity attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential\nvenues.\n   The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n——————\n   1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or\n\nwires in furtherance of “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain­\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.” 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail fraud); §1343\n(wire fraud). The honest-services statute, §1346, defines “the term\n‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ ” in these provisions to include “a scheme\nor artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.”\n4                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted\nEnron-related prosecutions,2 denied the venue-transfer\nmotion. Despite “isolated incidents of intemperate com­\nmentary,” the court observed, media coverage “ha[d]\n[mostly] been objective and unemotional,” and the facts of\nthe case were “neither heinous nor sensational.” App. to\nBrief for United States 10a–11a.3 Moreover, “courts ha[d]\ncommonly” favored “effective voir dire . . . to ferret out any\n[juror] bias.” Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case,\nthe court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that\nSkilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\nId., at 22a.\n   In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court\nsolicited from the parties questions the court might use to\nscreen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a ques-\ntionnaire’s format and content, Skilling and the Govern­\nment submitted dueling documents.

These rulings were made by two other\njudges of the same District. Three judges residing in the area thus\nindependently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could\nobtain a fair trial in Houston.\n   3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding En­\n\nron’s collapse, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion relies heavily on affidavits\nof media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support\nof his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 2, 3, 4, 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 5, n. 2, and\n23, n. 10; post, at 26, and 35, n. 22. These Skilling-employed experts\nselected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories.\nBut the District Court Judge did not find the experts’ samples repre­\nsentative of the coverage at large; having “[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed]\nall of the evidence” Skilling presented, the court concluded that “inci­\ndents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language” were\ndwarfed by “the largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.” App. to\nBrief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a.

Skilling’s\nquestions “[we]re more helpful,” the court said, “because\n[they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow\nthe potential jurors to give us more meaningful informa­\ntion.” Id., at 9539. The court converted Skilling’s submis­\nsion, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page\ndocument that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia,\ntheir sources of news and exposure to Enron-related pub­\nlicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its col­\nlapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possi­\nble guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\nand to anyone affected by its demise.4\n——————\n  4 Questions included the following: “What are your opinions about the\ncompensation that executives of large corporations receive?”; “Have\nyou, any family members, or friends ever worked for or applied for work\nwith,” “done business with,” or “owned stock in Enron Corporation or\nany Enron subsidiaries and partnership?”; “Do you know anyone . . .\nwho has been negatively affected or hurt in any way by what happened\nat Enron?”; “Do you have an opinion about the cause of the collapse of\nEnron? If YES, what is your opinion? On what do you base your\nopinion?”; “Have you heard or read about any of the Enron cases? If\nYES, please tell us the name of all sources from which you have heard\nor read about the Enron cases.”; “Have you read any books or seen any\nmovies about Enron?

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In November 2005, the District Court mailed the ques­\ntionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses\nfrom nearly all the addressees. The court granted hard­\nship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at\n11773–11774, and the parties, with the court’s approval,\nfurther winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for\ncause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891,\n13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, “each\nand every” prospective juror who said that a preexisting\nopinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her\nfrom impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at\n13668.\n   On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date\nscheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded\nguilty. Skilling’s attorneys immediately requested a con­\ntinuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the pro­\nceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In\nthe interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,\narguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive\nbias and that news accounts of Causey’s guilty plea fur­\nther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial\nvenue, Skilling urged that “jurors need to be questioned\nindividually by both the Court and counsel” concerning\ntheir opinions of Enron and “publicity issues.” Id., at\n12074.\n   The District Court again declined to move the trial.\nSkilling, the court concluded, still had not “establish[ed]\nthat pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]\na presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id., at 14115.\nThe questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,\nprovided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.\n\n——————\nthe defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence\npresented during the trial of . . .

I get more forthcoming responses from\n     potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I\n     don’t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers—\n     but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a\n     candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the\n     question.” Id., at 11805.\nBut the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to\nask follow-up questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire\nmembers should be examined individually about pretrial\npublicity, id., at 11051–11053. The court also allotted the\ndefendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than\nthe standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi­\nnal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673–13675.\n   Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court\nfirst emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial­\nity and explained the presumption of innocence and the\nGovernment’s burden of proof. The trial, the court next\ninstructed, was not a forum “to seek vengeance against\nEnron’s former officers,” or to “provide remedies for” its\nvictims. App. 823a. “The bottom line,” the court stressed,\n“is that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, consci­\nentiously and impartially serve if selected.” Id., at 823a–\n824a. In response to the court’s query whether any pro­\nspective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these\ninstructions, two individuals indicated that they could not\nbe fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,\n819a–820a.\n   After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District\nCourt brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench\n——————\n  5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward\n\nthe victims of Enron’s collapse or a desire to see justice done would\noverpower prospective jurors’ impartiality.

Although the questions var­\nied, the process generally tracked the following format:\nThe court asked about exposure to Enron-related news\nand the content of any stories that stood out in the pro­\nspective juror’s mind. Next, the court homed in on ques­\ntionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible\nbias. The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up\nquestions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away,\nthe court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.\nIn all, the court granted one of the Government’s for-\ncause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the\ndefendants’ challenges and denied six. The parties agreed\nto excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for\nhardship.\n   By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 pro­\nspective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremp­\ntory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.6\nBefore the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the\nseating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in\nfact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used\n——————\n    6 Selection\n              procedures of similar style and duration took place in\nthree Enron-related criminal cases earlier prosecuted in Houston—\nUnited States v.

Supp. App. 3sa–4sa\n(Sealed).7 The court overruled this objection.\n  After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told\nthem they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow\nmedia accounts of the proceedings. “[E]ach of you,” the\ncourt explained, “needs to be absolutely sure that your\ndecisions concerning the facts will be based only on the\nevidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.” App.\n1026a.\n  Following a 4-month trial and nearly five days of delib­\neration, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, includ­\ning the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not\nguilty of 9 insider-trading counts. The District Court\nsentenced Skilling to 292 months’ imprisonment, 3 years’\nsupervised release, and $45 million in restitution.\n  On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his\nconvictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services\narguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the\nFifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and\nnegative tone of media coverage generated by Enron’s\ncollapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554\nF. 3d 529, 559 (2009).8 The court also noted potential\n——————\n   7 Skilling had requested an additional peremptory strike each time\n\nthe District Court rejected a for-cause objection. The court, which had\nalready granted two extra peremptories, see supra, at 7, denied each\nrequest.\n   8 The Fifth Circuit described the media coverage as follows:\n\n   “Local newspapers ran many personal interest stories in which\nsympathetic individuals expressed feelings of anger and betrayal\ntoward Enron. . . . Even the [Houston] Chronicle’s sports page wrote of\nSkilling’s guilt as a foregone conclusion. Similarly, the Chronicle’s\n‘Pethouse Pet of the Week’ section mentioned that a pet had ‘enjoyed\nwatching those Enron jerks being led away in handcuffs.’ These are\nbut a few examples of the Chronicle’s coverage.” 554 F. 3d, at 559\n(footnote omitted).\n10               SKILLING v.

[who] lost their jobs,\nand . . . saw their 401(k) accounts wiped out,” to Housto­\nnians who suffered spillover economic effects. Id., at 559–\n560.\n   The Court of Appeals stated, however, that “the pre­\nsumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,” and it therefore\nexamined the voir dire to determine whether “the District\nCourt empanelled an impartial jury.” Id., at 561 (internal\nquotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).\nThe voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit’s view, “proper and\nthorough.” Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skill-\ning had challenged only one seated juror—Juror 11—for\ncause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments\nabout corporate greed, the District Court “observed [his]\ndemeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would\nmake the government prove its case.” Id., at 564. In sum,\nthe Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome\nthe presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not\n“show[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced\nagainst him.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling’s claim that\nhis conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit\nhonest-services fraud. “[T]he jury was entitled to convict\nSkilling,” the court stated, “on these elements”: “(1) a\nmaterial breach of a fiduciary duty . . . (2) that results in a\ndetriment to the employer,” including one occasioned by\nan employee’s decision to “withhold material information,\ni.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a\nreasonable employer to change its conduct.” Id., at 547.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling’s argument that\nthe honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude\nhis actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally\nvague.

And even if it had\nbeen possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, “[t]he\ntruncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out\nprejudices,” he contends, so “[f]ar from rebutting the pre­\nsumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively\nconfirmed it.” Id., at 21. Skilling’s fair-trial claim thus\nraises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court\nerr by failing to move the trial to a different venue based\non a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual preju­\ndice contaminate Skilling’s jury?10\n                        A\n                        1\n  The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants\n\n——————\n  9 We   also granted certiorari and heard arguments this Term in two\nother cases raising questions concerning the honest-services statute’s\nscope.

Black, post, p. ___; Weyhrauch, post, p. ___.\n   10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of preju­\n\ndice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling’s petition for\ncertiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when,\nif ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Al­\nthough we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we\nconsider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the\nquestion we agreed to decide.

When\ndoes the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal\ndim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due proc­\ness requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence?\nBecause most cases of consequence garner at least some\npretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in\ndiverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing\nthe presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Cir­\ncuit’s analysis in Skilling’s case proceeded. The founda­\ntion precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723\n(1963).\n   Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana\ntown, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of\nthem. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel\npresent and obtained his confession. Without informing\nRideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the\ninterrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before\nthe trial, a local television station broadcast the film to\naudiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.\nRideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could\nnot receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime oc­\ncurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000\npeople. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury\neventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Lou­\nisiana upheld the conviction.\n   We reversed. “What the people [in the community] saw\non their television sets,” we observed, “was Rideau, in jail,\nflanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in\ndetail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and\nmurder.” Id., at 725. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people\nwho saw and heard it,” we explained, the interrogation “in\na very real sense was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded\nguilty.” Id., at 726. We therefore “d[id] not hesitate to\nhold, without pausing to examine a particularized tran­\n14                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscript of the voir dire,” that “[t]he kangaroo court proceed­\nings” trailing the televised confession violated due process.\nId., at 726–727.\n    We followed Rideau’s lead in two later cases in which\nmedia coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.\nIn Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive\npublicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure\nduring preliminary court proceedings as reporters and\ntelevision crews overran the courtroom and “bombard[ed]\n. . . the community with the sights and sounds of” the\npretrial hearing. The media’s overzealous reporting ef­\nforts, we observed, “led to considerable disruption” and\ndenied the “judicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol\nEstes] was entitled.” Id., at 536.\n    Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nnews reporters extensively covered the story of Sam\nSheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant\nwife to death. “[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during\nthe trial and newsmen took over practically the entire\ncourtroom,” thrusting jurors “into the role of celebrities.”\nId., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char­\nacterized as “months [of] virulent publicity about\nSheppard and the murder,” did not alone deny due proc­\ness, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard’s case involved\nmore than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder\nconviction because a “carnival atmosphere” pervaded the\ntrial, id., at 358.\n    In each of these cases, we overturned a “conviction\nobtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted\nby press coverage”; our decisions, however, “cannot be\nmade to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to\n. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively\ndeprives the defendant of due process.” Murphy v.

S. 717, 722 (1961) (Jurors are not required\nto be “totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved”;\n“scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will\nnot have formed some impression or opinion as to the\nmerits of the case.”); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S.\n145, 155–156 (1879) (“[E]very case of public interest is\nalmost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention\nof all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely\nany one can be found among those best fitted for jurors\nwho has not read or heard of it, and who has not some\n——————\nMurphy, a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the 1964 heist\nof the Star of India sapphire from New York’s American Museum of\nNatural History. Pointing to “extensive press coverage” about him,\nMurphy moved to transfer venue. 421 U. S., at 796. The trial court\ndenied the motion and a jury convicted Murphy. We affirmed. Mur­\nphy’s trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings\nat issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723 (1963), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nwhich “entirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a\ndefendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of\nfairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.” 421 U. S., at 799. Voir dire\nrevealed no great hostility toward Murphy; “[s]ome of the jurors had a\nvague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each\nhad some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief\nin the relevance of [his] past to the present case.” Id., at 800 (footnote\nomitted).\n  13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount’s confession to a brutal\n\nmurder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed\ndue to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During\nvoir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an\nopinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates\nadmitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt. 467 U. S., at\n1029–1030.       Nevertheless, we rejected Yount’s presumption-of­\nprejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we\nnoted, were at their height prior to Yount’s first trial, four years before\nthe second prosecution; time had helped “sooth[e] and eras[e]” commu­\nnity prejudice, id., at 1034.\n16                  SKILLING v.

A\npresumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends\nonly the extreme case.\n                             3\n   Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling as­\nserts that we need not pause to examine the screening\nquestionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury’s\nverdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differ­\nences separate Skilling’s prosecution from those in which\nwe have presumed juror prejudice.14\n   First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size\nand characteristics of the community in which the crime\noccurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the mur­\nder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.\nHouston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in\nthe Nation: At the time of Skilling’s trial, more than 4.5\nmillion individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the\nHouston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of\npotential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial indi­\nviduals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 429 (1991) (potential\nfor prejudice mitigated by the size of the “metropolitan\nWashington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a popula­\ntion of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hun­\ndreds of murders are committed each year”); Gentile v.\nState Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1044 (1991) (plurality\nopinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was\ndrawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15\n——————\n  14 Skilling’s reliance on Estes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced;\n\nthose cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings\nduring trial. See supra, at 14. Skilling does not assert that news\ncoverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.\n  15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with\n\nhis first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named\nhim when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not\nkind, they contained no confession or other blatantly\nprejudicial information of the type readers or viewers\ncould not reasonably be expected to shut from sight.\nRideau’s dramatically staged admission of guilt, for in­\nstance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of any­\none who watched it. Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,\n72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he defendant’s own con­\nfession [is] probably the most probative and damaging\nevidence that can be admitted against him.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill­\ning was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of\nthe smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa­\nbility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251–\n252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (“A jury may have difficulty in\ndisbelieving or forgetting a defendant’s opinion of his own\nguilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of\nothers because they may not be well-founded.”).\n  Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a\nwidely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over\nfour years elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skill­\ning’s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related\nnews throughout this period, the decibel level of media\nattention diminished somewhat in the years following\nEnron’s collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467\nU. S., at 1032, 1034.\n  Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling’s jury acquit­\nted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier\ninstituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no over­\n—————— \n\nApp. 375a–376a. In response to the follow-up question “[w]hat words \n\ncome to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?”, two-thirds of\n\nrespondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43%\n\neither had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind\n\nwhen they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling’s name was\n\nassociated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210–\n\n3211; see App. 417a–492a. \n\n18                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhelming victory for the Government.16 In Rideau, Estes,\nand Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury’s verdict did\nnot undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias. It\nwould be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice\nin a case in which jurors’ actions run counter to that pre­\nsumption. See, e.g., United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867\nF. 2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (“The jury’s ability to discern\na failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes\nindicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and\nreinforces our belief and conclusion that the media cover­\nage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an\nimpartial trial.”).\n                               4\n   Skilling’s trial, in short, shares little in common with\nthose in which we approved a presumption of juror preju­\ndice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion\nbased primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of\nmedia attention directed at Enron. But “pretrial public­\nity—even pervasive, adverse publicity—does not inevita­\nbly lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stu\nart, 427 U. S. 539, 554 (1976). In this case, as just noted,\nnews stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid,\nunforgettable information we have recognized as particu­\nlarly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston’s size and\ndiversity diluted the media’s impact.17\n——————\n  16 As  the United States summarizes, “[i]n Hirko, the jury deliberated\nfor several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly,\nwhich was routinely described as ‘the first Enron criminal trial,’ the\njury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron execu­\ntive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of\nslightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that\nthe true loss . . . was $40 million.” Brief for United States 9–10 (cita­\ntion omitted).\n   17 The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention\n\naimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron’s downfall more generally.\nData submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Although the\nwidespread community impact necessitated careful identi­\nfication and inspection of prospective jurors’ connections to\nEnron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow­\nup voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight\nshows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra,\nat 24, jurors’ links to Enron were either nonexistent or\nattenuated.\n   Finally, although Causey’s “well-publicized decision to\nplead guilty” shortly before trial created a danger of juror\nprejudice, 554 F. 3d, at 559, the District Court took appro­\npriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the\nproceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that\ndevelopment. And during voir dire, the court asked about\nprospective jurors’ exposure to recent publicity, including\nnews regarding Causey. Only two venire members re­\ncalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and\nneither ultimately served on Skilling’s jury. App. 888a,\n993a. Although publicity about a codefendant’s guilty plea\ncalls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does\nnot ordinarily—and, we are satisfied, it did not here—\nwarrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.\n   Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 we conclude\nthat the District Court, in declining to order a venue\nchange, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19\n——————\ntransfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories\nspecifically named him. App. 572a. “[W]hen publicity is about the\nevent, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen\nany prejudicial impact.” United States v. Hueftle, 687 F. 2d 1305, 1310\n(CA10 1982).\n  18 The parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can\n\nbe rebutted, and, if it can, what standard of proof governs that issue.\nCompare Brief for Petitioner 25–35 with Brief for United States 24–32,\n35–36. Because we hold that no presumption arose, we need not, and\ndo not, reach these questions.\n  19 The dissent acknowledges that “the prospect of seating an unbiased\n20                 SKILLING v.

See United States v. Wood, 299\nU. S. 123, 145–146 (1936) (“Impartiality is not a technical\nconception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of\nthis mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con­\nstitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is\nnot chained to any ancient and artificial formula.”). Jury\nselection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is “particularly\nwithin the province of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross,\n424 U. S. 589, 594–595 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 424; Yount, 467\nU. S., at 1038; Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U. S.\n182, 188–189 (1981) (plurality opinion); Connors v. United\nStates, 158 U. S. 408–413 (1895).\n   When pretrial publicity is at issue, “primary reliance on\nthe judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good\nsense” because the judge “sits in the locale where the\npublicity is said to have had its effect” and may base her\nevaluation on her “own perception of the depth and extent\nof news stories that might influence a juror.” Mu’Min, 500\nU.

See Reynolds, 98 U. S., at 156–157. In contrast to\nthe cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in­\nthe-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more inti­\nmate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member’s\nfitness for jury service. We consider the adequacy of jury\nselection in Skilling’s case, therefore, attentive to the\nrespect due to district-court determinations of juror im­\npartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that\nimpartiality.20\n——————\n  20 The  dissent recognizes “the ‘wide discretion’ owed to trial courts\nwhen it comes to jury-related issues,” post, at 22 (quoting Mu’Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427 (1991)), but its analysis of the District\nCourt’s voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness. For\nexample, the dissent faults the District Court for not questioning\nprospective jurors regarding their “knowledge of or feelings about”\nCausey’s guilty plea. Post, at 28. But the court could reasonably\ndecline to ask direct questions involving Causey’s plea to avoid tipping\noff until-that-moment uninformed venire members that the plea had\noccurred. Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to\nfind a way to question venire members about Causey “without mention­\ning anything”). Nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about\nvenire members’ knowledge of the plea; indeed, counsel posed such a\nquestion, id., at 993a; cf. post, at 28, n. 14 (acknowledging that counsel\n“squeeze[d] in” an inquiry whether a venire member had “read about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). From this Court’s lofty and “panoramic”\nvantage point, post, at 22, lines of voir dire inquiry that “might be\nhelpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial” are not hard to\nconceive.

Our review of the record, however,\nyields a different appraisal.21\n   As noted, supra, at 4–6, and n. 4, the District Court\ninitially screened venire members by eliciting their re­\nsponses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large\npart by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospec­\ntive jurors excusable for cause and served as a spring­\nboard for further questions put to remaining members of\nthe array. Voir dire thus was, in the court’s words, the\n“culmination of a lengthy process.” App. 841a; see 554\nF. 3d, at 562, n. 51 (“We consider the . . . questionnaire in\n——————\nthe trial court’s failure to ask these questions must render the defen­\ndant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id., at 425–426. According appro­\npriate deference to the District Court, we cannot characterize jury­\nselection in this case as fundamentally unfair. Cf. supra, at 8, n. 6\n(same selection process was used in other Enron-related prosecutions).\n  21 In addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire, our decisions\n\nhave also “take[n] into account . . . other measures [that] were used to\nmitigate the adverse effects of publicity.” Nebraska Press Assn. v.\nStuart, 427 U. S. 539, 565 (1976). We have noted, for example, the\nprophylactic effect of “emphatic and clear instructions on the sworn\nduty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in\nopen court.” Id., at 564. Here, the District Court’s instructions were\nunequivocal; the jurors, the court emphasized, were duty bound “to\nreach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the\nevidence [they] hear[d] and read in th[e] courtroom.” App. 1026a.\nPeremptory challenges, too, “provid[e] protection against [prejudice],”\nUnited States ex rel.

See\nsupra, at 8, n. 6.23\n   The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware\nof the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity,\nto ensure against jury bias. At Skilling’s urging, the court\nexamined each prospective juror individually, thus pre­\nventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other\nvenire members. See Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 425. To en­\ncourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that\nthere were “no right and wrong answers to th[e] ques­\ntions.” E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling’s re­\nquest for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience,\npotential jurors were “more forthcoming” when the court,\nrather than counsel, asked the question.

Notably, the “open-ended questions about\n[prospective jurors’] impressions of Enron or Skilling” that the dissent\ncontends should have been asked, post, at 30, were asked—on the\nquestionnaire, see supra, at 5–6, n. 4. Moreover, the District Court\ngave Skilling’s counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about\ntheir responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g., App. 869a–870a; id., at\n878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus follow-up opportunity to\ninterrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling’s counsel “clear ave­\nnue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.” But see post, at 31, n. 17. See also\nApp. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (“Judge, for the record, if I don’t ask\nany questions, it’s because the Court and other counsel have covered\nit.”).\n   23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the “Big Five” public ac­\n\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen. See supra, at 8, n. 6. Among media\nreaders and auditors, the name and reputation of Arthur Andersen\nlikely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of\nJeffrey Skilling.

Skilling’s counsel declined to ask\nanything of more than half of the venire members ques­\ntioned individually, including eight eventually selected for\nthe jury, because, he explained, “the Court and other\ncounsel have covered” everything he wanted to know.\nApp. 967a.\n   Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the\nindividuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,\nnotwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection\nprocess successfully secured jurors who were largely un­\ntouched by Enron’s collapse.24 Eleven of the seated jurors\nand alternates reported no connection at all to Enron,\nwhile all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial\nlink. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (“I once met a\nguy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his\nname.”).25 As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alter­\nnates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention\nto Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a–860a (Juror\n\n——————\n  24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury,\n\nthe dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that\njury. See, e.g., post, at 6, n. 4 (quoting the questionnaires of ten venire\nmembers; all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced, see\nRecord 11891); post, at 7, n. 6 (quoting the questionnaires of 15 venire\nmembers; none sat on Skilling’s jury); post, at 10–11, n. 7 (quoting voir\ndire testimony of six venire members; none sat on Skilling’s jury); post,\nat 28–34 (reporting at length voir dire testimony of Venire Members 17,\n29, 61, 74, 75, and 101; none sat on Skilling’s jury). Statements by\nnonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury­\nselection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one\nindicator that the process fulfilled its function. Critically, as discussed\ninfra, at 24–26, the seated jurors showed little knowledge of or interest\nin, and were personally unaffected by, Enron’s downfall.\n  25 See also Supp. App. 11sa (Juror 10) (“knew some casual co-workers\n\nthat owned Enron stock”); id., at 26sa (Juror 11) (“work[s] with some­\none who worked at Enron”); id., at 117sa; App. 940a (Juror 64) (two\nacquaintances lost money due to Enron’s collapse); Supp. App. 236sa\n(Juror 116) (work colleague lost money as a result of Enron’s\nbankruptcy).\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

In the months before Irvin’s trial, “a barrage” of\npublicity was “unleashed against him,” including reports\nof his confessions to the slayings and robberies. Id., at\n725–726. This Court’s description of the media coverage\nin Irvin reveals why the dissent’s “best case” is not an apt\ncomparison:\n    “[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin’s] background,\n    including a reference to crimes committed when a ju­\n    venile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years pre­\n    viously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL\n    charges during the war. He was accused of being a\n    parole violator. The headlines announced his police\n    line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test,\n    had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the\n    six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess.\n    Finally, they announced [Irvin’s] confession to the six\n    murders and the fact of his indictment for four of\n    them in Indiana. They reported [Irvin’s] offer to plead\n    guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the de­\n    termination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to\n    secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had con­\n    fessed to 24 burglaries (the modus operandi of these\n    robberies was compared to that of the murders and\n    the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed\n    the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing\n    [Irvin’s] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin]\n    as remorseless and without conscience but also as\n    having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of\n    doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described\n    as the ‘confessed slayer of six,’ a parole violator and\n    fraudulent-check artist.       [Irvin’s] court-appointed\n    counsel was quoted as having received ‘much criticism\n    over being Irvin’s counsel’ and it was pointed out, by\n28               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject\n     to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On\n     the day before the trial the newspapers carried the\n     story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of\n     [one victim] as well as ‘the robbery-murder of [a sec­\n     ond individual]; the murder of [a third individual],\n     and the slaughter of three members of [a different\n     family].’ ” Id., at 725–726.\n“[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were\ndelivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in” the county\nwhere the trial occurred, which had a population of only\n30,000; “radio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed\nthat county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the\nsame incidents.” Id., at 725.\n  Reviewing Irvin’s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that\n“the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice” in the commu­\nnity “was clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir\ndire”: “370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those exam­\nined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,”\nand “[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.”\nId., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although\nthese jurors declared they could be impartial, we held\nthat, “[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much\nthat [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so\nhuge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one\nin which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing\nany testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.” Id., at\n728.\n  In this case, as noted, supra, at 17, news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­\nmation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies\nand murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in\ncommon with the rural community in which Irvin’s trial\nproceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media\nsources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling’s seated jurors, moreover, exhib­\nited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin. See\nsupra, at 24–26 (noting, inter alia, that none of Skilling’s\njurors answered “yes” when asked if they “ha[d] an opinion\nabout . . . Skilling”). See also post, at 19 (dissent) (distin­\nguishing Mu’Min from Irvin on similar bases: the “offense\noccurred in [a large] metropolitan . . . area,” media “cover­\nage was not as pervasive as in Irvin and did not contain\nthe same sort of damaging information,” and “the seated\njurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion\nabout the case” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In\nlight of these large differences, the District Court had far\nless reason than did the trial court in Irvin to discredit\njurors’ promises of fairness.\n   The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire\nmembers who proclaimed their impartiality at their\nword.30 As noted, all of Skilling’s jurors had already af­\nfirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no\ntrouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.\nNevertheless, the court followed up with each individually\nto uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to\ngauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information\nfrom the questionnaires regarding jurors’ backgrounds,\nopinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy\nfoundation to assess fitness for jury service.

The\njury’s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts\nafter nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests\nthe court’s assessments were accurate. See United States\nv. Haldeman, 559 F. 2d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976).31\nSkilling, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell\nshort of constitutional requirements.32\n\n——————\n    31 The dissent asserts that “the Government placed relatively little\n\nemphasis on [these] insider trading counts during its closing argu­\nment.” Post, at 39. As the record shows, however, counsel described in\ndetail the evidence supporting Count 50, one of the insider-trading\ncounts on which the jury returned a not-guilty verdict. See Record\n37008–37010. Skilling, Government counsel asserted, sold “half of his\nstock” based on “material inside information” and then lied in testi­\nmony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by claim­\ning the “only reason [he] sold Enron stock was because of [the] Septem­\nber 11th [terrorist attacks].” Id., at 37009 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As counsel summarized: “Mr. Skilling used our nation’s\ntragedy to cover his tracks. . . . I’d suggest . . . the reason he was lying\nis because he didn’t want [the SEC] to know that he had done it before.\n. . . [T]hat’s Count 50. That’s proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at\n37010.       Regarding the remaining insider-trading counts, counsel\nreminded jurors they had heard similar evidence of Skilling’s other\nsales, and urged them to “conclude, based on the evidence,” that “Skill­\ning had information that he used to sell his stock” at the “key periods in\ntime.” Ibid.\n    32 Skilling emphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who\n\nsuffered from Enron’s collapse because the District Court failed to grant\nhis for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund\nlost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron\nstock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on\nSkilling’s jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory chal­\nlenge. “[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge’s erroneous for­\ncause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently\nconvicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,” we have held, “he has\nnot been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.” United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 307 (2000). Indeed, the “use [of] a\nperemptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error”\nexemplifies “a principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the\nconstitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.” Id., at 316.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

See United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 316 (2000) (“[T]he seat­\ning of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause\n. . . require[s] reversal.”). In reviewing claims of this type,\nthe deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: “A\ntrial court’s findings of juror impartiality may be over­\nturned only for manifest error.” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 428\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover,\nunsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for\ncause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the [other]\njurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as\nto his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558\n(1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to\nSkilling’s specific allegations of juror partiality.\n    Skilling contends that Juror 11—the only seated juror\nhe challenged for cause—“expressed the most obvious\nbias.” Brief for Petitioner 35. See also post, at 36 (dis­\nsent). Juror 11 stated that “greed on Enron’s part” trig­\ngered the company’s bankruptcy and that corporate execu­\ntives, driven by avarice, “walk a line that stretches\nsometimes the legality of something.” App. 854a–855a.\nBut, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11\n    “had ‘no idea’ whether Skilling had ‘crossed that line,’\n    and he ‘didn’t say that’ every CEO is probably a crook.\n    He also asserted that he could be fair and require the\n    government to prove its case, that he did not believe\n    everything he read in the paper, that he did not ‘get\n    into the details’ of the Enron coverage, that he did not\n    watch television, and that Enron was ‘old news.’ ” 554\n    F. 3d, at 563–564.\nDespite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that\nSkilling “earned [his] salar[y],” App. 857a, and said he\nwould have “no problem” telling his co-worker, who had\n32                  SKILLING v.

Id., at 858a; cf. supra, at 29,\nn. 30. We agree with the Court of Appeals that “[t]he\nexpress finding that Juror 11 was fair is not reversible\nerror.” 554 F. 3d, at 564.33\n   Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six spe­\ncific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he\nnot already exhausted his peremptory challenges. See\nsupra, at 8–9. Juror 20, he observes, “said she was ‘angry’\nabout Enron’s collapse and that she, too, had been ‘forced\nto forfeit [her] own 401(k) funds to survive layoffs.’ ” Reply\nBrief 13. But Juror 20 made clear during voir dire that\nshe did not “personally blame” Skilling for the loss of her\nretirement account. App. 875a. Having not “pa[id] much\nattention” to Enron-related news, she “quite honestly” did\nnot “have enough information to know” whether Skilling\nwas probably guilty, id., at 873a, and she “th[ought] [she]\ncould be” fair and impartial, id., at 875a. In light of these\nanswers, the District Court did not commit manifest error\nin finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.\n   The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out,\nwrote on her questionnaire “that [Skilling] ‘probably knew\n[he] w[as] breaking the law.’ ” Reply Brief 13. During voir\ndire, however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not “really\nhave an opinion [about Skilling’s guilt] either way,” App.\n936a; she did not “know what [she] was thinking” when\nshe completed the questionnaire, but she “absolutely”\npresumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her under­\nstanding that the Government would “have to prove” his\n——————\n  33 Skilling’s trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not\n\nregard Juror 11 as so “obvious[ly] bias[ed],” Brief for Petitioner 35, as to\nwarrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In response to follow-up questions from\nSkilling’s counsel, she again stated she would not presume\nthat Skilling violated any laws and could “[a]bsolutely”\ngive her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a–938a.\n“Jurors,” we have recognized, “cannot be expected invaria­\nbly to express themselves carefully or even consistently.”\nYount, 467 U. S., at 1039. See also id., at 1040 (“It is here\nthat the federal [appellate] court’s deference must operate,\nfor while the cold record arouses some concern, only the\ntrial judge could tell which of these answers was said with\nthe greatest comprehension and certainty.”). From where\nwe sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.\n   The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have\nexcluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign\nof prejudice we can discern. See App. 891a–892a (Juror\n38) (remembered no media coverage about Enron and said\nnothing in her experience would prevent her from being\nfair and impartial); Supp. App. 131sa–133sa, 136sa (Juror\n67) (had no connection to Enron and no anger about its\ncollapse); App. 969a (Juror 78) (did not “know much about”\nEnron); Supp. App. 165sa, App. 971a (Juror 84) (had not\nheard or read anything about Enron and said she did not\n“know enough to answer” the question whether she was\nangry about the company’s demise). Skilling’s counsel\ndeclined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors\nand, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because\nshe “gave all the right answers.” Id., at 972a. Whatever\nSkilling’s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi­\nviduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis­\nplayed a disqualifying bias.34\n——————\n   34 Although Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at\n\ntrial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for\nPetitioner 14–15; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,\nthe voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that\nthey were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a–853a (Juror 10) (did not\nprejudge Skilling’s guilt, indicated he could follow the court’s instruc­\n34                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption\nof prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\ntried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,\nneed not enter the box with empty heads in order to de­\ntermine the facts impartially. “It is sufficient if the ju­\nror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.”\nIrvin, 366 U. S., at 723. Taking account of the full record,\nrather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from\nit, we find no cause to upset the lower courts’ judgment\nthat Skilling’s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm\nthe Fifth Circuit’s ruling that Skilling received a fair\ntrial.35\n                           III\n   We next consider whether Skilling’s conspiracy convic­\ntion was premised on an improper theory of honest­\nservices wire fraud. The honest-services statute, §1346,\nSkilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna­\ntively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within\nthe statute’s compass.\n                            A\n To place Skilling’s constitutional challenge in context,\nwe first review the origin and subsequent application of\n——————\ntions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair\nto Skilling, and said he would “judge on the facts”); id., at 974a (Juror\n87) (had “not formed an opinion” on whether Skilling was guilty and\naffirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).\n   35 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror\n\nprejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S. 415;\nPatton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.\n794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest\nconveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a\npremise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions\nwhen they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence\npresented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and\nthe District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe honest-services doctrine.\n                               1\n   Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the\npredecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,\nproscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to\nadvance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” See McNally\nv. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con­\ngress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,\n“any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money\nor property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.” §1341 (emphasis added); see\nid., at 357–358. Emphasizing Congress’ disjunctive phras­\ning, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted\nthe term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depri­\nvations not only of money or property, but also of intangi­\nble rights.\n   In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi­\nble-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110\n(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu­\ntion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from\nentrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial\nto the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city]\nwas to make and did make a saving by the operations\nthere could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court\nof Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. “A scheme to get a\npublic contract on more favorable terms than would likely\nbe got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court\nobserved, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of\nbribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.”\nId., at 115.\n   The Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Shushan stimulated the\ndevelopment of an “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike\nfraud in which the victim’s loss of money or property\nsupplied the defendant’s gain, with one the mirror image\nof the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,\n36              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor­\nruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender\nprofited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of\nmoney or property; instead, a third party, who had not\nbeen deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a\ncity mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third\nparty in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,\nyet the contract terms were the same as any that could\nhave been negotiated at arm’s length, the city (the be­\ntrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,\n483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,\nactionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to\nthe offender’s “honest services.” See, e.g., United States v.\nDixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).\n   “Most often these cases . . . involved bribery of public\nofficials,” United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167, 1171\n(CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector\nhonest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application\nof the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing\na bribery scheme, explained:\n     “When one tampers with [the employer-employee] re­\n     lationship for the purpose of causing the employee to\n     breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is de­\n     frauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual\n     deception that is practised is in the continued repre­\n     sentation of the employee to the employer that he is\n     honest and loyal to the employer’s interests.” United\n     States v.

Crim. L. Rev.\n423, 456 (1983).36\n                                    2\n  In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States,\nstopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine\nin its tracks. McNally involved a state officer who, in\nselecting Kentucky’s insurance agent, arranged to procure\na share of the agent’s commissions via kickbacks paid to\ncompanies the official partially controlled. 483 U. S., at\n360. The prosecutor did not charge that, “in the absence of\nthe alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid\na lower premium or secured better insurance.” Ibid. In­\nstead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback\nscheme “defraud[ed] the citizens and government of Ken­\ntucky of their right to have the Commonwealth’s affairs\nconducted honestly.” Id., at 353.\n  We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.\n“Rather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that\nleaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the\nFederal Government in setting standards of disclosure and\ngood government for local and state officials,” we read the\nstatute “as limited in scope to the protection of property\nrights.” Id., at 360. “If Congress desires to go further,” we\nstated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid.\n\n\n\n——————\n  36 In addition to upholding honest-services prosecutions, courts also\n\nincreasingly approved use of the mail-fraud statute to attack corruption\nthat deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights, including\nelection fraud and privacy violations. See, e.g., Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 18, n. 2 (2000); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.\n350, 362–364, and nn. 1–4 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n38               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              3\n\n   Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it\nenacted a new statute “specifically to cover one of the\n‘intangible rights’ that lower courts had protected . . . prior\nto McNally: ‘the intangible right of honest services.’ ”\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19–20 (2000). In\nfull, the honest-services statute stated:\n     “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United\n     States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud,\n     §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the term ‘scheme or\n     artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to\n     deprive another of the intangible right of honest ser­\n     vices.” §1346.\n                              B\n  Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not\nclearly: He asserts that §1346 is unconstitutionally vague.\nTo satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordi­\nnary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461\nU. S. 352, 357 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine\nembraces these requirements.\n  According to Skilling, §1346 meets neither of the two\ndue process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible\nright of honest services,” he contends, does not adequately\ndefine what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38–39.\nSecond, he alleges, §1346’s “standardless sweep allows\npolicemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal\npredilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] opportunistic and\narbitrary prosecutions.” Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461\nU. S., at 358).\n  In urging invalidation of §1346, Skilling swims against\nour case law’s current, which requires us, if we can, to\nconstrue, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  39\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571\n(1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products\nCorp., 372 U. S. 29, 32 (1963) (stressing, in response to a\nvagueness challenge, “[t]he strong presumptive validity\nthat attaches to an Act of Congress”). Alert to §1346’s\npotential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on\nhow best to interpret the statute.37 Uniformly, however,\nthey have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia­\nbly vague.38\n   We agree that §1346 should be construed rather than\ninvalidated. First, we look to the doctrine developed in\npre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the mean­\ning of the phrase “the intangible right of honest services.”\nSecond, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the\nstatute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to\nits core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved\nfraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services\nthrough bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who\nhad not been deceived. Confined to these paramount\n——————\n  37 Courts have disagreed about whether §1346 prosecutions must be\n\nbased on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v. Brum\nley, 116 F. 3d 728, 734–735 (CA5 1997) (en banc), with, e.g., United\nStates v. Weyhrauch, 548 F. 3d 1237, 1245–1246 (CA9 2008), vacated\nand remanded, post, p. ___; whether a defendant must contemplate that\nthe victim suffer economic harm, compare, e.g., United States v. Sun-\nDiamond Growers of Cal., 138 F. 3d 961, 973 (CADC 1998), with, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Black, 530 F. 3d 596, 600–602 (CA7 2008), vacated and\nremanded, post, p. ___; and whether the defendant must act in pursuit\nof private gain, compare, e.g., United States v. Bloom, 149 F. 3d 649,\n655 (CA7 1998), with, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F. 3d 678,\n692 (CA3 2002).\n  38 See, e.g., United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napplications, §1346 presents no vagueness problem.\n                               1\n  There is no doubt that Congress intended §1346 to refer\nto and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized\nin Court of Appeals’ decisions before McNally derailed the\nintangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner\n39; Brief for United States 37–38; post, at 2, 8 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress\nenacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S.,\nat 355 (“intangible righ[t]”); id., at 362 (STEVENS, J., dis­\nsenting) (“right to . . . honest services”).39 As the Second\nCircuit observed in its leading analysis of §1346:\n     “The definite article ‘the’ suggests that ‘intangible\n     right of honest services’ had a specific meaning to\n     Congress when it enacted the statute—Congress was\n     recriminalizing mail- and wire-fraud schemes to de­\n     prive others of that ‘intangible right of honest ser­\n     vices,’ which had been protected before McNally, not\n     all intangible rights of honest services whatever they\n     might be thought to be.” United States v. Rybicki, 354\n     F. 3d 124, 137–138 (2003) (en banc).40\n\n——————\n  39 Although verbal formulations varied slightly, the words employed\n\nby the Courts of Appeals prior to McNally described the same concept:\n“honest services,” e.g., United States v. Bruno, 809 F. 2d 1097, 1105\n(CA5 1987); “honest and faithful services,” e.g., United States v. Brown,\n540 F. 2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); and “faithful and honest services,” e.g.,\nUnited States v. Diggs, 613 F. 2d 988, 998 (CADC 1979).\n  40 We considered a similar Court-Congress interplay in McDermott\n\nInt’l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991), which involved the inter­\npretation of the term “seaman” in the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688\n(2000 ed.). The Act, we recognized, “respond[ed] directly to” our deci­\nsion in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 (1903), and “adopt[ed] without\nfurther elaboration the term used in” that case, so we “assume[d] that\nthe Jones Act use[d] ‘seaman’ in the same way.” 498 U.

See infra, at 43–44, 46. In parsing the Courts of\nAppeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling’s vague­\nness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\npreceding McNally were not models of clarity or consis­\ntency. See Brief for Petitioner 39–42 (describing divisions\nof opinions). See also post, at 3–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nWhile the honest-services cases preceding McNally domi­\nnantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to brib­\nery and kickback schemes—schemes that were the basis of\nmost honest-services prosecutions—there was consider­\nable disarray over the statute’s application to conduct\noutside that core category. In light of this disarray, Skill­\ning urges us, as he urged the Fifth Circuit, to invalidate\nthe statute in toto. Brief for Petitioner 48 (Section 1346 “is\nintolerably and unconstitutionally vague.”); Brief of De­\nfendant-Appellant Jeffrey K. Skilling in No. 06–20885\n(CA5), p. 65, n. 21 (“[S]ection 1346 should be invalidated\nas unlawfully vague on its face.”).\n  It has long been our practice, however, before striking\na federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider\nwhether the prescription is amenable to a limiting con­\nstruction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n657 (1895) (“The elementary rule is that every reasonable\nconstruction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute\nfrom unconstitutionality.” (emphasis added)). See also\nBoos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 330–331 (1988); Schneider v.\nSmith, 390 U.

The Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64,\n118 (1804), and has for so long been applied by this Court that it is\nbeyond debate.” Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast\nBuilding & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). See, e.g.,\n42                 SKILLING v.

S. 612, 618 (1954) (“[I]f\nthe general class of offenses to which the statute is di­\nrected is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be\nstruck down as vague . . . . And if this general class of\noffenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reason­\nable construction of the statute, this Court is under a duty\nto give the statute that construction.”).\n  Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling\ncontends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable\nhonest-services core; “the pre-McNally caselaw,” he as­\nserts, “is a hodgepodge of oft-conflicting holdings” that are\n“hopelessly unclear.” Brief for Petitioner 39 (some capi­\ntalization and italics omitted).

Stating that he “know[s] of no\nprecedent for . . . ‘paring down’ ” the pre-McNally case law to its core,\nibid., he contends that the Court today “wield[s] a power we long ago\nabjured: the power to define new federal crimes,” post, at 1. See also,\ne.g., post, at 9, 10, 11. As noted supra, at 41–42, and n. 41, cases\n“paring down” federal statutes to avoid constitutional shoals are legion.\nThese cases recognize that the Court does not legislate, but instead\nrespects the legislature, by preserving a statute through a limiting\ninterpretation. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 267–268,\nn. 6 (1997) (This Court does not “create a common law crime” by adopt­\ning a “narrow[ing] constru[ction].” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nsupra, at 44–45, n. 43. Given that the Courts of Appeals uniformly\nrecognized bribery and kickback schemes as honest-services fraud\nbefore McNally, 483 U. S. 350, and that these schemes composed the\nlion’s share of honest-services cases, limiting §1346 to these heartland\napplications is surely “fairly possible.” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,\n331 (1988); cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380 (2005) (opinion of\nthe Court by SCALIA, J.) (when adopting a limiting construction, “[t]he\nlowest common denominator, as it were, must govern”). So construed,\nthe statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 48–49; post, at\n8. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged\nthrough a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step\nwith precedent.\n46              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand “Congress clearly intended to revive th[at] nondisclo­\nsure theory.” Id., at 44. Moreover, “[a]lthough not as\nnumerous as the bribery and kickback cases,” the Gov­\nernment asserts, “the pre-McNally cases involving undis­\nclosed self-dealing were abundant.” Ibid.\n   Neither of these contentions withstands close inspec­\ntion. McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 37,\n43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public official, in\nexchange for routing Kentucky’s insurance business\nthrough a middleman company, arranged for that com­\npany to share its commissions with entities in which the\nofficial held an interest. 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. This\nwas no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest;\nrather, the official conspired with a third party so that\nboth would profit from wealth generated by public con­\ntracts. See id., at 352–353. Reading §1346 to proscribe\nbribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—satisfies Con­\ngress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n   Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of­\ninterest cases constitute core applications of the honest­\nservices doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\nhonest-services convictions for “some schemes of non­\ndisclosure and concealment of material information,”\nMandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on\nwhich schemes qualified. In light of the relative infre­\nquency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to\nbribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit incon­\nsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable\nlimiting construction of §1346 must exclude this amor­\nphous category of cases.\n   Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar\nprinciple that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal\nstatutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” Cleveland,\n531 U. S., at 25 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.

The\nGovernment proposes a standard that prohibits the “taking of official\naction by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial\ninterests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he\nowes a fiduciary duty,” so long as the employee acts with a specific\nintent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim\nto change its behavior. Id., at 43–44. See also id., at 40–41. That\nformulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct\nor significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To\nwhat extent does the official action have to further that interest in\norder to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and\nwhat information should it convey? These questions and others call for\nparticular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohi­\nbition in this context.\n48              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               4\n\n   Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\nschemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. Recall\nthat the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns\nabout (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory\nprosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. A prohibi­\ntion on fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest\nservices by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present\na problem on either score.\n   As to fair notice, “whatever the school of thought con­\ncerning the scope and meaning of ” §1346, it has always\nbeen “as plain as a pikestaff that” bribes and kickbacks\nconstitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951), and the statute’s mens rea\nrequirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g.,\nScrews v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104 (1945)\n(plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU. S. 601, 608 (1973) (“[E]ven if the outermost boundaries\nof [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little\nrelevance . . . where appellants’ conduct falls squarely\nwithin the ‘hard core’ of the statute’s proscriptions.”).\nToday’s decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls\nwithin §1346’s province. See United States v. Lanier, 520\nU. S. 259, 266 (1997) (“[C]larity at the requisite level may\nbe supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain\nstatute.”).\n   As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant\nrisk that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it\ntoday, will be stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on\nbribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-\nMcNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscrib­\ning—and defining—similar crimes. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n§§201(b), 666(a)(2); 41 U. S. C. §52(2) (“The term ‘kick­\nback’ means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift,\ngratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind\nwhich is provided, directly or indirectly, to [enumerated\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Whitfield, 590 F. 3d 325, 352–353 (CA5\n2009); United States v. Kemp, 500 F. 3d 257, 281–286\n(CA3 2007). A criminal defendant who participated in\na bribery or kickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably\ncomplain about prosecution under §1346 on vagueness\ngrounds.\n                               C\n    It remains to determine whether Skilling’s conduct\nviolated §1346. Skilling’s honest-services prosecution, the\nGovernment concedes, was not “prototypical.” Brief for\nUnited States 49. The Government charged Skilling with\nconspiring to defraud Enron’s shareholders by misrepre­\nsenting the company’s fiscal health, thereby artificially\ninflating its stock price. It was the Government’s theory\nat trial that Skilling “profited from the fraudulent scheme\n. . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and\nthrough the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron\nstock, which netted him $89 million.” Id., at 51.\n    The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skill­\ning solicited or accepted side payments from a third party\nin exchange for making these misrepresentations. See\nRecord 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government\nto the District Court) (“[T]he indictment does not allege,\nand the government’s evidence did not show, that [Skill­\n——————\n  46 Overlap with other federal statutes does not render §1346 superflu­\n\nous. The principal federal bribery statute, §201, for example, generally\napplies only to federal public officials, so §1346’s application to state\nand local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct\nthat might otherwise go unpunished.\n50                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning] engaged in bribery.”). It is therefore clear that, as we\nread §1346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.\n   Because the indictment alleged three objects of the con-\nspiracy—honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property\nwire fraud, and securities fraud—Skilling’s conviction\nis flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298\n(1957) (constitutional error occurs when a jury is in­\nstructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a\ngeneral verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory).\nThis determination, however, does not necessarily require\nreversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently con­\nfirmed, in Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008) (per\ncuriam), that errors of the Yates variety are subject to\nharmless-error analysis. The parties vigorously dispute\nwhether the error was harmless. Compare Brief for\nUnited States 52 (“[A]ny juror who voted for conviction\nbased on [the honest-services theory] also would have\nfound [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities\nfraud.”) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government “cannot\nshow that the conspiracy conviction rested only on the\nsecurities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally­\nflawed honest-services theory.”). We leave this dispute for\nresolution on remand.47\n   Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count\ntouches any of Skilling’s other convictions is also an open\nquestion. All of his convictions, Skilling contends, hinged\non the conspiracy count and, like dominoes, must fall if it\n\n——————\n  47 The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, “if\n\nany of the three objects of Skilling’s conspiracy offers a legally insuffi­\ncient theory,” it “must set aside his conviction.” 554 F. 3d, at 543. That\nreasoning relied on the mistaken premise that Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555\nU. S. ___ (2008) (per curiam), governs only cases on collateral review.\nSee 554 F. 3d, at 543, n. 10. Harmless-error analysis, we clarify,\napplies equally to cases on direct appeal. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit,\non remand, should take a fresh look at the parties’ harmless-error\narguments.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

I therefore join Parts\nI and II of the Court’s opinion. I also agree that the deci­\nsion upholding Skilling’s conviction for so-called “honest­\nservices fraud” must be reversed, but for a different rea­\nson. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S. C. §1346\n(2006 ed., Supp. II) that “scheme or artifice to defraud” in\nthe mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, §§1341 and 1343\n(2006 ed.), includes “a scheme or artifice to deprive an­\nother of the intangible right of honest services,” is vague,\nand therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility\nin proclaiming that our task is “not to destroy the Act . . .\nbut to construe it,” ante, at 43 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in transforming the prohibition of “honest­\nservices fraud” into a prohibition of “bribery and kick­\nbacks” it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the\npower to define new federal crimes. See United States v.\nHudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\n2                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it\nproscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague\ncannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan\nzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by\njudicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its\ntext does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.\n214, 219–221 (1876). Our cases have described vague\nstatutes as failing “to provide a person of ordinary intelli­\ngence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so\nstandardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri­\nously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Wil\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues\nthat §1346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages\narbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of\nthe right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.\nBrief for Petitioner 38–39, 42–44. In my view Skilling is\ncorrect.\n   The Court maintains that “the intangible right of honest\nservices ” means the right not to have one’s fiduciaries\naccept “bribes or kickbacks.” Its first step in reaching\nthat conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to\n“the doctrine developed” in cases decided by lower federal\ncourts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,\n483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I\nagree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the\nlower-court case law that had been disapproved by\nMcNally—what the Court calls “the pre-McNally honest­\nservices doctrine,” ante, at 43. The problem is that that\ndoctrine provides no “ascertainable standard of guilt,”\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89\n(1921), and certainly is not limited to “bribes or kick­\nbacks.”\n   Investigation into the meaning of “the pre-McNally\nhonest-services doctrine” might logically begin with\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nMcNally itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the\nmany Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the\nmeaning of “fraud” in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat­\nutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483\nU. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi­\ntion of “bribery and kickbacks,” one would have expected\nthose words to appear in the opinion’s description of the\ncases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally\neven provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing\ntheory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right\nof citizens “to have the [State]’s affairs conducted hon­\nestly,” id., at 353, to “honest and impartial government,”\nid., at 355, to “good government,” id., at 356, and “to have\npublic officials perform their duties honestly,” id., at 358.\nIt described prior case law as holding that “a public official\nowes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office\nfor private gain is a fraud,” id., at 355.\n   But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not\nlimited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held\nthat those fiduciaries subject to the “honest services”\nobligation included private individuals who merely par­\nticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.\nGray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295–1296 (CA6 1986) (citing\nUnited States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2\n1982)), and even private employees who had no role in\npublic decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720\nF. 2d 1327, 1335–1336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von\nBarta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, “to say\nthat a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it\ngives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations\ndoes he owe as a fiduciary?” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318\nU. S. 80, 85–86 (1943). None of the “honest services”\ncases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those\npertaining to private employees, defined the nature and\ncontent of the fiduciary duty central to the “fraud” offense.\n   There was not even universal agreement concerning the\n4                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsource of the fiduciary obligation—whether it must be\npositive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.\nRabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen­\neral principles, such as the “obligations of loyalty and\nfidelity” that inhere in the “employment relationship,”\nLemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed\nhad grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)\ntrust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes­\ntooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec­\nond) of Trusts §§169–185 (1976). Another pre-McNally\ncase referred to the general law of agency, United States v.\nBallard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on\nother grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes\nduties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re­\nstatement (Second) of Agency §§377–398 (1957).\n   This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes\nthat the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common­\nlaw fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde­\nfined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad\nlanguage. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5\n1967), loftily declared that “[l]aw puts its imprimatur on\nthe accepted moral standards and condemns conduct\nwhich fails to match the ‘reflection of moral uprightness,\nof fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the\ngeneral and business life of members of society.’ ” Id., at\n671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109\n(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any\nscheme “contrary to public policy” was also condemned by\n——————\n    1 The\n        Court is untroubled by these divisions because “these debates\nwere rare in bribe and kickback cases,” in which “[t]he existence of a\nfiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually\nbeyond dispute,” ante, at 43, n. 42. This misses the point. The Courts\nof Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a\nbribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not\nconsistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a\nfiduciary.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe statute, United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167,\n1171 (CA9 1980). See also United States v. Mandel, 591\nF. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is “contrary\nto public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of\nmoral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and\nright dealing”). Even opinions that did not indulge in such\ngrandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond\nloyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005–\n1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be\ngreater for public officials than for private employees, see,\ne.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,\nn. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never\nmade clear.\n   The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many\ncourts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere\nbreach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest­\nservices fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col­\nlecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512\n(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute\nabout that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing\nduties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d\n234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that\ndid require something additional where a public official\nwas involved, there was disagreement as to what the\naddition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,\n522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate­\nrial misrepresentations and active concealment were\nenough, id., at 647–648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,\nthe Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was\nneeded, id., at 1026.\n   Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private\nemployees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must\nuse his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare\nLemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron\nston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion\nupheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the\n6                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndefendant’s “failure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and\nconsulting fees from [his employer’s] suppliers resulted in\na breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of\nhis loyal and honest services.” United States v. Bryza, 522\nF. 2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however,\ndemanded more than an intentional failure to disclose:\n“There must be a failure to disclose something which in\nthe knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an\nindependent business risk to the employer.” Lemire, 720\nF. 2d, at 1337. Other courts required that the victim\nsuffer some loss, see, e.g., Ballard, supra, at 541–542—a\nproposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981);\nUnited States v. O’Malley, 535 F. 2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).\nThe Court’s statement today that there was a deprivation\nof honest services even if “the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party,” ante, at 36, is\ntherefore true, except to the extent it is not.\n   In short, the first step in the Court’s analysis—holding\nthat “the intangible right of honest services” refers to “the\nhonest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals’\ndecisions before McNally,” ante, at 40—is a step out of the\nfrying pan into the fire. The pre-McNally cases provide no\nclear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of\nhonest services. The possibilities range from any action\nthat is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to\nonly the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his\nprincipal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator’s position\nof trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The\nduty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but\nmaybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the\ncase of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time §1346\nwas enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing\namong these options, for conclusively settling what was in\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

It knows that adopting\nby reference “the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine,”\nante, at 43, is adopting by reference nothing more precise\nthan the referring term itself (“the intangible right of\nhonest services”). Hence the deus ex machina: “[W]e pare\nthat body of precedent down to its core,” ante, at 39. Since\nthe honest-services doctrine “had its genesis” in bribery\nprosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for\nSkilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as “core”\nor “paradigm” or “typical” examples, or “[t]he most obvious\nform,” of honest-services fraud, ante, at 43–44 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel\nfor the Government say that they formed the “vast major­\nity,” or “most” or at least “[t]he bulk” of honest-services\ncases, ante, at 43–44 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nTHEREFORE it must be the case that they are all\nCongress meant by its reference to the honest-services\ndoctrine.\n   Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it\nwould not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the stat­\nute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what\nacts constitute a breach of the “honest services” obligation\nunder the pre-McNally law. But it would not solve the\nmost fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the\n“fiduciary capacity” to which the bribery and kickback\n——————\n   2 Courts since §1346’s enactment have fared no better, reproducing\n\nsome of the same disputes that predated McNally. See, e.g., Sorich v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3–4) (collecting cases). We have previ­\nously found important to our vagueness analysis “the conflicting results\nwhich have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges\nin seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.”\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921). I am at\na loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.\n8                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                             Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nrestriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials?\nOr in addition to private individuals who contract with the\npublic? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer\nhere? The pre-McNally case law does not provide an\nanswer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limita­\ntion the statute does not answer the question “What is the\ncriterion of guilt?”\n   But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvi­\nous that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was\nnot the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and\nkickbacks represented “the core” of the doctrine, or that\nmost cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,\nis not to say that they are the doctrine. All it proves is\nthat the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with\nregard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much\nmore. Among all the pre-McNally smörgåsbord-offerings\nof varieties of honest-services fraud, not one is limited to\nbribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has\ncooked up all on its own.\n   Thus, the Court’s claim to “respec[t] the legislature,”\nante, at 45, n. 44 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely\nclear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to\nreinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law; and\nentirely clear that that prohibited much more (though\nprecisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kick­\nbacks. Perhaps it is true that “Congress intended §1346 to\nreach at least bribes and kickbacks,” ante, at 44. That\nsimply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that “§1346\ncriminalizes only” bribery and kickbacks, ante, at 45.\n   Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation\nbut invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal stan­\ndard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (in­\ncluded within the vague one) that can pass constitutional\nmuster. I know of no precedent for such “paring down,”3\n——————\n    3 The   only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is Civil Ser\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nand it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power. This is\nnot, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of\nadopting a “limiting construction” in the face of potential\nunconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care­\nful to note, the narrowing construction must be “fairly\npossible,” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), “rea­\nsonable,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),\nor not “plainly contrary to the intent of Congress,” Edward\nJ. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &\nConstr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we\nhave seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before\nMcNally concluded that the “deprivation of honest ser­\nvices” meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If\nit were a “fairly possible” or “reasonable” construction, not\n“contrary to the intent of Congress,” one would think that\nsome court would have adopted it. The Court does not\neven point to a post-McNally case that reads §1346 to\ncover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the\nCourt so heavily relies, see ante, at 41–42, states that\n“when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the\n——————\nvice Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in­\nvolved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of\nthe Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a\nvagueness challenge—not, however, by “paring down” the adjudications\nto a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what\nthey held was not vague. See id., at 571–574. The string of cases the\nCourt lists, see ante, at 41–42, n. 41, (almost none of which addressed\nclaims of vagueness), have nothing to do with “paring down.” The one\nthat comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.\n363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized\nby statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be\ncommenced and completed. That is not much different from “reading\nin” a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con­\ntracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or “paring down” of\nthe statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that\nthe proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370–371, and noted that\n(unlike here) it was not “decid[ing] issues of policy,” id., at 372.\n10               SKILLING v.

Attorney General v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United\nStates v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45 (1953) (describing the\ncanon as decisive “in the choice of fair alternatives”). Here\nthere is no choice to be made between two “fair alterna­\ntives.” Until today, no one has thought (and there is no\nbasis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib­\nited only bribery and kickbacks.\n   I certainly agree with the Court that we must, “if we\ncan,” uphold, rather than “condemn,” Congress’s enact­\nments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the\npower, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.\nCongress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest­\nservices law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)\nunclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the\ntemptation to make all things right with the stroke of our\npen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).\nI would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill­\ning’s conviction on the basis that §1346 provides no “ascer­\ntainable standard” for the conduct it condemns, L. Cohen,\n255 U. S., at 89. Instead, the Court today adds to our\nfunctions the prescription of criminal law.\n                              III\n   A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted\nsupra, at 2, Skilling has argued that §1346 cannot be\nconstitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi­\nnition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though\nthis reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling’s\nchallenge a “facial” one, in the sense that it seeks invalida­\ntion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to\npreventing its enforcement against him. I continue to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndoubt whether “striking down” a statute is ever an appro­\npriate exercise of our Article III power. See Chicago v.\nMorales, 527 U. S. 41, 77 (1999) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIn the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skill­\ning identifies in §1346 may mean that if he wins, anyone\nelse prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see\nSmith, supra, at 576–578. But Skilling only asks that his\nconviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57–58, so the\nremedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.\n  I would therefore reverse Skilling’s conviction under\n§1346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it\nprohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions—\nobvious from my reasoning in the case—would be a matter\nfor stare decisis.\n                        *    *     *\n  It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the\ndescription of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be\ndone, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness\nopinions, United States v. Reese, 92 U. S., at 221:\n       “The question, then, to be determined, is, whether\n    we can introduce words of limitation into a penal\n    statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it\n    is general only.\n         “It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature\n    could set a net large enough to catch all possible of­\n    fenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and\n    say who could be rightfully detained, and who should\n    be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute\n    the judicial for the legislative department of the gov­\n    ernment. . . .\n         “To limit this statute in the manner now asked\n    for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old\n    one.

I write separately to address peti\ntioner’s jury-trial argument.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants\na trial before “an impartial jury.” In my view, this re\nquirement is satisfied so long as no biased juror is actually\nseated at trial. Of course, evidence of pretrial media\nattention and widespread community hostility may play a\nrole in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important\nin assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu’Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 428–432 (1991), or in reviewing\nthe denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for\ncause, see, e.g., Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036–\n1040 (1984). There are occasions in which such evidence\nweighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end,\nhowever, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no\nviolation of the defendant’s right to an impartial jury. See\nid., at 1031–1035, 1041; Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,\n800–801, 803 (1975); see also Rivera v. Illinois, 556 U. S.\n___, ___–___ (2009) (slip op., at 7–8); United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 311, 316–317 (2000);\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 215–218 (1982).\n   Petitioner advances a very different understanding of\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe jury-trial right. Where there is extraordinary pretrial\npublicity and community hostility, he contends, a court\nmust presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of\nvenue. Brief for Petitioner 25–34. I disagree. Careful voir\ndire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even\nwhere pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile\ncommunity sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been\nselected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to\ninsulate jurors from media coverage during the course of\nthe trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is “an\nimpartial jury.” If the jury that sits and returns a verdict\nis impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth\nAmendment requires.\n   The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text\nof the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It re\nquires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse\npretrial media coverage and community hostility in a\nparticular case has reached a certain level of severity, but\nthere is no clear way of demarcating that level or of de\ntermining whether it has been met.\n   Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960’s—\nSheppard v.

I respect­\nfully dissent, however, from the Court’s conclusion that\nJeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial\njury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the\npublic’s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a\ncourt must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the\njury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The\nsudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of\npeople in the Houston area and shocked the entire com­\nmunity. The accompanying barrage of local media cover­\nage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As\nEnron’s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the\nstorm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not\nconstitutionally compel a change of venue, they required\nthe District Court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which\nprospective jurors’ attitudes about the case were closely\nscrutinized. The District Court’s inquiry lacked the neces­\nsary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether\nthe jury empaneled to decide Skilling’s case was capable of\nrendering an impartial decision based solely on the evi­\ndence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would\n2                SKILLING v.

The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.\nVirtually overnight, what had been the city’s “largest,\nmost visible, and most prosperous company,” its “foremost\nsocial and charitable force,” and “a source of civic pride”\nwas reduced to a “shattered shell.” App. ¶¶11, 13, pp.\n649a–650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company’s employ­\nees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van­\nish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,\nthousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses\nshuttered, and community groups that once benefited from\nEnron’s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con­\ntributions. See, e.g., 3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also\n554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (“Accounting firms that\nserviced Enron’s books had less work, hotels had more\nopen rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on”).\nEnron’s community ties were so extensive that the entire\nlocal U. S. Attorney’s Office was forced to recuse itself\nfrom the Government’s investigation into the company’s\nfall. See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).\n   With Enron’s demise affecting the lives of so many\nHoustonians, local media coverage of the story saturated\nthe community. According to a defense media expert, the\nHouston Chronicle—the area’s leading newspaper—\nassigned as many as 12 reporters to work on the Enron\nstory full time. App. 568a–569a. The paper mentioned\nEnron in more than 4,000 articles during the 3-year period\nfollowing the company’s December 2001 bankruptcy filing.\nHundreds of these articles discussed Skilling by name.\nSee 3 Supp. Record 2114.

Local television news coverage\nwas similarly pervasive and, in terms of “editorial theme,”\n“largely followed the Chronicle’s lead.” Id., ¶11, at 559a;\nsee also id., at 717a. Between May 2002 and October\n2004, local stations aired an estimated 19,000 news seg­\nments involving Enron, more than 1600 of which men­\ntioned Skilling. 3 Supp. Record 2116.\n   While many of the stories were straightforward news\nitems, many others conveyed and amplified the commu­\nnity’s outrage at the top executives perceived to be respon­\nsible for the company’s bankruptcy. A Chronicle report on\nSkilling’s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the\ncoverage. It began, “Across Houston, Enron employees\nwatched former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling’s congres­\nsional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry\nand then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy\nand detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance\nabout critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed\nenergy giant.” App. 1218a. “ ‘He is lying; he knew every­\nthing,’ said [an employee], who said she had seen Skilling\nfrequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling\nwas known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at\nthe company. ‘I am getting sicker by the minute.’ ” Id., at\n1219a. A companion piece quoted a local attorney who\ncalled Skilling an “idiot” who was “in denial”; he added,\n“I’m glad [Skilling’s] not my client.” Id., at 592a–593a.\n   Articles deriding Enron’s senior executives were juxta­\nposed with pieces expressing sympathy toward and soli­\ndarity with the company’s many victims. Skilling’s media\nexpert counted nearly a hundred victim-related stories in\nthe Chronicle, including a “multi-page layout entitled ‘The\nFaces of Enron,’ ” which poignantly described the gut­\nwrenching experiences of former employees who lost vast\n4                   SKILLING v.

The conventional wisdom that blame for\nEnron’s devastating implosion and the ensuing human\ntragedy ultimately rested with Skilling and former Enron\nChairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the\npopular imagination that references to their involvement\neven turned up on the sports pages: “If you believe the\nstory about [Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do\nwith the end of Emmitt Smith’s Cowboys career, then you\nprobably believe in other far-fetched concepts. Like Jeff\nSkilling having nothing to do with Enron’s collapse.” 3\nSupp. Record 811.\n   When a federal grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and\nRichard Causey—Enron’s former chief accounting officer—\nin 2004 on charges of conspiracy to defraud, securities\nfraud, and other crimes, the media placed them directly in\nits crosshairs. In the words of one article, “there was one\nthing those whose lives were touched by the once-exalted\ncompany all seemed to agree upon: The indictment of\nformer Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was overdue.” App.\n1393a. Scoffing at Skilling’s attempts to paint himself as\n“a ‘victim’ of his subordinates,” id., at 1394a, the Chronicle\nderided “the doofus defense” that Lay and Skilling were\nexpected to offer, id., at 1401a.1 The Chronicle referred to\n——————\n    1 See\n        also App. 735a (describing Enron as “hardball fraud” and noting\nthat “Enron prosecutors have approached the case more like an organ­\nized crime investigation than a corporate fraud prosecution,” a “tactic\n[that] makes sense” given “the sheer pervasiveness of fraud, corruption,\nand self-dealing”); id., at 1403a (“Lay stood proudly in front of Enron’s\nfacade of success, while Skilling and his own prot[égé], [Andrew]\nFastow, ginned up increasingly convoluted mechanisms for concealing\nthe financial reality. . . .

Voir dire, it concluded, would\nprovide an effective means to “ferret out any bias” in the\njury pool. Id., at 18a; see ante, at 4.\n   To that end, the District Court began the jury selection\nprocess by mailing screening questionnaires to 400 pro­\nspective jurors in November 2005.

During arraignment, news outlets “fol­\nlowed each man as he drove from his home to FBI headquarters, to the\ncourt, and back home, often providing ‘color’ commentary—such as\ninterviewing former Enron employees for comment on the day’s events.”\nId., ¶60, at 581a.\n  3 Reporting on the change-of-venue motion, the Chronicle described\n\nSkilling as a “desperate defendant,” and the Austin American-\nStatesman opined that while a change of venue may make sense “[f]rom\na legal perspective,” “from the standpoint of pure justice, the wealthy\nexecutives really should be judged right where their economic hurri­\ncane struck with the most force.” Id., at 748a, 747a.\n6                    SKILLING v.

More than one-third of the prospective\njurors (approximately 99 of 283, by my count) indicated\nthat they or persons they knew had lost money or jobs as a\nresult of the Enron bankruptcy. Two-thirds of the jurors\n(about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the\ndefendants that suggested a potential predisposition to\nconvict. In many instances, they did not mince words,\ndescribing Skilling as “smug,” “arrogant,” “brash,” “con­\nceited,” “greedy,” “deceitful,” “totally unethical and crimi­\nnal,” “a crook,” “the biggest liar on the face of the earth,”\nand “guilty as sin” (capitalization omitted).4 Only about 5\npercent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read\nthe Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise “heard or read\nabout any of the Enron cases,” Record 13019, were not\nconnected to Enron victims, and gave no answers suggest­\n——————\n   4 See, e.g., Juror 1 (“Ken Lay and the others are guilty as all get out\n\nand ought to go to jail”; Skilling is “[b]rash, [a]rrogant [and]\n[c]onceited”; “I find it morally awful that these people are still running\nloose”); Juror 70 (“Mr. Skilling is the biggest liar on the face of the\nearth”); Juror 163 (Skilling “would lie to his mother if it would further\nhis cause”); Juror 185 (“I think [Skilling] was arrogant and a crook”);\nJuror 200 (Skilling is a “[s]killful [l]iar [and] crook” who did “a lot of the\ndirty work”; the defendants would “have to be blind, deaf, [and] stupid\nto be unaware of what was happening!” (emphasis deleted)); Juror 206\n(Skilling is “[t]otally unethical and criminal”; the defendants “are all\nguilty and should be reduced to having to beg on the corner [and] live\nunder a bridge”); Juror 238 (“They are all guilty as sin—come on now”);\nJuror 299 (Skilling “initiated, designed, [and] authorized certain illegal\nactions”); Juror 314 (Lay “should ‘fess up’ and take his punishment like\na man”; “[t]he same goes for Jeffrey Skilling. . . .

UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nplea wreaks havoc for Lay, Skilling.” Record 12049, n. 13;\nsee also ibid. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who de­\nscribed the plea as “a serious blow to the defense”). A\nChronicle editorial opined that “Causey’s admission of\nsecurities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay’s claim that\nmost of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial\npressure rather than actual wrongdoing.” Id., at 12391.\n   With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re­\nnewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the\nquestionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con­\nfirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In\nthe alternative, Skilling asserted that “defendants are\nentitled to a more thorough jury selection process than\ncurrently envisioned by the [c]ourt.” Id., at 12067. The\ncourt had announced its intention to question individual\njurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre­\nsent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,\ne.g., id., at 11804–11805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter\nalia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in\nquestioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri­\nvately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would\nbe easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,\nclients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070–12072; and\nthat the court “avoid leading questions,” which “tend to\n[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that\nmay not reflect their actual views,” id., at 12072. At a\nminimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a\ncontinuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques­\ntionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at\n12074–12075.\n   The District Court denied Skilling’s motion without a\nhearing, stating in a brief order that it was “not persuaded\nthat the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .\nestablish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju­\ndice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id.,\nat 14115. According to the court, the “jury questionnaires\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the\ncourt’s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide\nadequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the\nselection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.” Id., at\n14115–14116. The court did agree to delay the trial by\ntwo weeks, until January 30, 2006.\n  The coming trial featured prominently in local news\noutlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle\ndescribed “the hurt and anger and resentment” that had\nbeen “churn[ing] inside” Houstonians since Enron’s col­\nlapse. Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for\noffering a “doofus defense” (“a plea of not guilty by reason\nof empty-headedness”), the paper stated that “Lay and\nSkilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet\nnow fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.”\nIbid. The article allowed that the defendants’ guilt,\n“though perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an\nassertion. A jury now takes up the task of deciding\nwhether that assertion is valid.” Id., at 39947. The next\nparagraph, however, assured readers that “it’s normal for\nyour skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe­\neyed innocence that they were unaware that something\nwas amiss at Enron. The company’s utter failure belies\nthe claim.” Ibid. (one paragraph break omitted); see also\nid., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would “have\nto offer a convincing explanation for how executives once\ntouted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark\nabout the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their\nown company”).\n  It is against this backdrop of widespread community\nimpact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection\nin Skilling’s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective\njurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse lo­\ncated “about six blocks from Enron’s former headquar­\nters.” 554 F. 3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the\nDistrict Court began by briefly describing the case and\n10                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nproviding a standard admonition about the need to be fair\nand impartial and to decide the case based solely on the\ntrial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked\nwhether anyone had “any reservations about your ability\nto conscientiously and fairly follow these very important\nrules.” App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands\nand were called forward to the bench. One told the court\nthat he thought Lay and Skilling “knew exactly what they\nwere doing” and would have to prove their innocence. Id.,\nat 818a–819a. The second juror, who had stated on his\nwritten questionnaire that he held no opinion that would\npreclude him from being impartial, declared that he\n“would dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to\nclaim responsibility, at least 1⁄12 of the responsibility, for\nputting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their\nlives.” Id., at 819a–820a. The court excused both jurors\nfor cause.\n   The court proceeded to question individual jurors from\nthe bench. As the majority recounts, ante, at 7–8, the\ncourt asked them a few general yes/no questions about\ntheir exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of,\n“Do you recall any particular articles that stand out that\nyou’ve read about the case?” App. 850a. The court also\nasked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,\nfocusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly\npartial comments, the prospective jurors believed they\n“could be fair” and “put the government to its proof.” Id.,\nat 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues\nraised by the court. The court made clear, however, that\nits patience would be limited, see, e.g., id., at 879a, and\nquestioning tended to be brief—generally less than five\nminutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying\nbiases among several prospective jurors who had earlier\nexpressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.7\n——————\n 7 See   App. 894a (Juror 43) (expressed the view that the defendants\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Start\nto finish, the selection process took about five hours.\n  Skilling’s trial commenced the next day and lasted four\nmonths. After several days of deliberations, the jury\nfound Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities\nfraud, 5 counts of making false representations to audi­\ntors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 in­\nsider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all\ncounts.\n  On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his\nconstitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\nAddressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by\ndisavowing the District Court’s findings concerning “com­\nmunity hostility.” There was, the court concluded, “suffi­\ncient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding\nof presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense\nvolume of coverage.” 554 F. 3d, at 559. “[P]rejudice was\n[also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator’s well­\n\n——————\n“stole money” from their employees); id., at 922a (Juror 55) (admitted\nthat she “lean[ed] towards prejudging” the defendants); id., at 946a\n(Juror 71) (stated that she would place the burden of proof on the\ndefendants); id., at 954a–960a (Juror 75) (indicated that she could not\nset aside her view that there was fraud at Enron); id., at 1003a–1006a\n(Juror 104) (stated that she questioned the defendants’ innocence and\nthat she “would be very upset with the government if they could not\nprove their case”); id., at 1008a (Juror 112) (expressed that the view\nthat the defendants were guilty).\n12              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npublicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.”\nIbid. The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District\nCourt for failing to “consider the wider context.” Id., at\n560. “[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess\nthe tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the\nvolume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the\nreal inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele­\nvant sources.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, “[t]he district court\nseemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more\nthan just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer\nnumber of victims.” Ibid.\n  Having determined that “Skilling was entitled to a\npresumption of prejudice,” the Court of Appeals proceeded\nto explain that “the presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the\ngovernment may demonstrate from the voir dire that an\nimpartial jury was actually impanelled.” Id., at 561 (in­\nternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire\nas “exemplary,” “searching,” and “proper and thorough,”\nid., at 562, the court concluded that “[t]he government\n[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that\nconvicted Skilling was impartial,” id., at 564–565. On this\nbasis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling’s claim and\naffirmed his convictions.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and\nthe due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran­\ntee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside\npreconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and\ndecide guilt or innocence “based on the evidence presented\nin court.” Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see\nalso Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966).\nCommunity passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial\npublicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsome instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of\nthe community becomes so severe as to give rise to a “pre­\nsumption of [juror] prejudice.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S.\n1025, 1031 (1984).\n   The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre­\nsumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:\nOnce the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com­\nmunity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to\nprove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly\nenvisions a fixed point at which public passions become so\nintense that prejudice to a defendant’s fair-trial rights\nmust be presumed. The majority declines, however, to\ndecide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the\nCourt of Appeals held.\n   This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive\nprejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely\nconvey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of\npublic enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju­\ndices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The under­\nlying question has always been this: Do we have confi­\ndence that the jury’s verdict was “induced only by evidence\nand argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­\nence, whether of private talk or public print”? Patterson v.\nColorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,\n462 (1907).\n   The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a\njury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the\nintensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial\npublicity and community animus.           Reviewing courts,\nmeanwhile, must assess whether the trial court’s proce­\ndures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury\nfree from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421\nU. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for “any\nindications in the totality of circumstances that peti­\ntioner’s trial was not fundamentally fair”). This Court’s\nprecedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different\n14              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsituations to safeguard a defendant’s constitutional right\nto a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n   At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare\noccasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circum­\nstances that it has reversed a defendant’s conviction\n“without pausing to examine . . . the voir dire examination\nof the members of the jury.” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373\nU. S. 723, 727 (1963). In Rideau, repeated television\nbroadcasts of the defendant’s confession to murder, rob­\nbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local senti­\nment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir\ndire could have secured an impartial jury. A change of\nvenue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to\nassure a fair trial. Ibid.; see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §23.2(a), p. 264\n(3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (“The best reading of\nRideau is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial\npublicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that\nthe voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the\nlikely prejudice among prospective jurors”).\n   As the majority describes, ante, at 14, this Court\nreached similar conclusions in Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S.\n532 (1965), and Sheppard, 384 U. S. 333. These cases\ninvolved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media\ndisruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argu­\nment that the defendants were not entitled to relief from\ntheir convictions because they “ha[d] established no isola­\ntable prejudice,” the Court described the “untoward cir­\ncumstances” as “inherently suspect.” Estes, 381 U. S., at\n542, 544. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to\nhave been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the “bed­\nlam” that surrounded them. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355.\nCriticizing the trial courts’ failures “to protect the jury\nfrom outside influence,” id., at 358, the Court stressed\nthat, “where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudi­\ncial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nshould continue the case until the threat abates, or trans­\nfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.”\nId., at 363. Estes and Sheppard thus applied Rideau’s\ninsight that in particularly extreme circumstances even\nthe most rigorous voir dire cannot suffice to dispel the\nreasonable likelihood of jury bias.\n   Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has\ndeclined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead\nexamined the particulars of the jury selection process to\ndetermine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted\nby pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court\nhas recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant\npervades the community there is a high risk that biased\njurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is\nnot merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately\nhide their prejudices, but also that, as “part of a commu­\nnity deeply hostile to the accused,” “they may unwittingly\n[be] influenced” by the fervor that surrounds them. Mur\nphy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in such\nadverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully con­\nsider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors\nand then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assur­\nances of fairness. Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719,\n729 (1992) (“[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant’s right\nto an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify\nunqualified jurors”).\n   Irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial\ncourt’s voir dire did not suffice to counter the “wave of\npublic passion” that had swept the community prior to the\ndefendant’s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news media\nhad “extensively covered” the crimes (a murder spree),\n“arous[ing] great excitement and indignation.” Id., at 719\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin’s\narrest, the press “blanketed” the community with “a bar­\nrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pic­\ntures” communicating numerous unfavorable details about\n16               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nIrvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. Id., at\n725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors ex­\namined during the trial court’s voir dire “entertained some\nopinion as to guilt—ranging in intensity from mere suspi­\ncion to absolute certainty.” Id., at 727. Of the 12 jurors\nseated, 8 “thought petitioner was guilty,” although “each\nindicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could ren­\nder an impartial verdict.” Id., at 727, 724.\n    Despite the seated jurors’ assurances of impartiality,\nthis Court invalidated Irvin’s conviction for want of due\nprocess. “It is not required,” this Court declared, “that the\njurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\n. . . It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression\nor opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence\npresented in court.” Id., at 722–723. The Court empha­\nsized, however, that a juror’s word on this matter is not\ndecisive, particularly when “the build-up of prejudice [in\nthe community] is clear and convincing.” Id., at 725.\nMany of Irvin’s jurors, the Court noted, had been influ­\nenced by “the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown\nto be present throughout the community.” Id., at 727\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not\n“doubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he\nwould be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so\nmany, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a state­\nment of impartiality can be given little weight.” Id., at\n728.\n    The media coverage and community animosity in Irvin\nwas particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this\nCourt recognized that high-profile cases may generate\nsubstantial publicity without stirring similar public pas­\nsions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court\nclarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case\nsuch as Irvin. So long as the trial court conducts a rea­\nsonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the abil­\nity of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     17\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\na verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would\ngenerally have no reason to doubt the jury’s impartiality.8\n  The first of these cases, Murphy, 421 U. S. 794, involved\na well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi­\ncized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied\nhis motion for a change of venue and during voir dire\nexcused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin­\nguishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir\ndire of “such hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who\nserved in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not\nbe laid aside.” 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors\n“had a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur­\nphy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]\npast crimes,” “none betrayed any belief in the relevance of\n[Murphy’s] past to the present case.” Ibid.; see also ibid.,\nn. 4 (contrasting a juror’s “mere familiarity with [a defen­\ndant] or his past” with “an actual predisposition against\nhim”). “[T]hese indicia of impartiality,” the Court sug­\ngested, “might be disregarded in a case where the general\natmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently\ninflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur­\nphy’s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.” Id., at 802.\n  In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant\nwas granted a new trial four years after being convicted of\nmurder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial\npublicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had\npreviously been convicted and had made confessions that\nwould be inadmissible in court. The state trial court\ndenied Yount’s motion and seated a jury following a 10­\nday voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the\n——————\n  8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court\n\nviolates a defendant’s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies\na for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on\nthe jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,\n316 (2000) (“[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed\nfor cause . . . would require reversal”).\n18               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nprospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent\n“admitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.”\nId., at 1029. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas\nreview, this Court stressed the significant interval be­\ntween Yount’s first trial—when “adverse publicity and the\ncommunity’s sense of outrage were at their height”—and\nhis second trial, which “did not occur until four years later,\nat a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly dimin­\nished and community sentiment had softened.” Id., at\n1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had\n“at some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt,”\nthe “particularly extensive” voir dire confirmed that “time\nhad weakened or eliminated any” bias they once may have\nharbored. Id., at 1029–1030, 1034, n. 10, 1033. Accord­\ningly, this Court concluded, “the trial court did not commit\nmanifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was\nimpartial.” Id., at 1032.\n   This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of\npretrial publicity in Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415\n(1991). Mu’Min stood accused of murdering a woman\nwhile out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper\narticles about the crime, Mu’Min moved for a change of\nvenue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and at­\ntempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of\nthe 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard\nabout the case from media or other sources. Dividing\nthese prospective jurors into panels of four, the court\nasked further general questions about their ability to be\nfair given what they had heard or read. One juror an­\nswered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The\ncourt refused Mu’Min’s request to ask more specific ques­\ntions “relating to the content of news items that potential\njurors might have read or seen.” Id., at 419. Of the 12\npersons who served on the jury, “8 had at one time or\nanother read or heard something about the case. None\nhad indicated that he had formed an opinion about the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncase or would be biased in any way.” Id., at 421.\n   Rejecting Mu’Min’s attempt to analogize his case to\nIrvin, this Court observed that “the cases differ both in the\nkind of community in which the coverage took place and in\nextent of media coverage.” 500 U. S., at 429. Mu’Min’s\noffense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,\narea, “which has a population of over 3 million, and in\nwhich, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed\neach year.” Ibid. While the crime garnered “substantial”\npretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in\nIrvin and “did not contain the same sort of damaging\ninformation.” 500 U. S., at 429–430. Moreover, in con­\ntrast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed\nhaving ever formed an opinion about the case. Given\nthese circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu’Min’s asser­\ntion that the trial court committed constitutional error by\ndeclining to “make precise inquiries about the contents of\nany news reports that potential jurors have read.” 500\nU. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling\nwas context-specific: “Had the trial court in this case been\nconfronted with the ‘wave of public passion’ engendered by\npretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin’s\ntrial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend­\nment might well have required more extensive examina­\ntion of potential jurors than it undertook here.” Id., at\n429.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to determine how this case compares to\nour existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances\nso inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most\nscrupulous voir dire would have been “but a hollow formal­\nity” incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373\nU. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac­\nter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process\nsufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and\n20              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncommunity animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable\nof presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial\ninfluences?\n                              A\n   Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that\nthe prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was\nnot so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District\nCourt acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling’s mo­\ntion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this\nconclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the\nsize and diversity of the Houston community make it\nprobable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number\nof persons who were unaffected by Enron’s collapse, neu­\ntral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the\npublic furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while\nubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court\npoints out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or\nsimilar “smoking-gun” evidence of specific criminal acts.\nFor many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen­\ndant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the\npleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt\nsuggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds\nexposed to such information would not necessarily have\nformed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was\nguilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major­\nity of the county’s residents were “exposed repeatedly and\nin depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing\nin detail to the crimes with which he was later to be\ncharged”). Third, there is no suggestion that the court­\nroom in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a\n“carnival” in which the “calmness and solemnity” of the\nproceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at\n358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus\nappropriate to examine the voir dire and determine\nwhether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the\n                       Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                        21\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\njury actually selected.9\n                                B\n   In concluding that the voir dire “adequately detect[ed]\nand defuse[d] juror bias,” ante, at 20, the Court downplays\nthe extent of the community’s antipathy toward Skilling\nand exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.\nThe devastating impact of Enron’s collapse and the relent­\nless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the\npart of the District Court to ensure the seating of an im­\npartial jury. While the procedures employed by the Dis­\ntrict Court might have been adequate in the typical high­\nprofile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary\ncircumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling’s constitu­\ntional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n\n——————\n  9 Whether   the District Court abused its discretion in declining to\nchange venue pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a\ndifferent question. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 21(a) (“Upon the defen­\ndant’s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that\ndefendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a\nprejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that\nthe defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there”). As this\nCourt has indicated, its supervisory powers confer “more latitude” to set\nstandards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 424 (1991). While the circumstances\nmay not constitutionally compel a change of venue “without pausing to\nexamine . . . the voir dire,” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723, 727\n(1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the\ncommunity’s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that\nthe task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major chal­\nlenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far\neasier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story\nhad less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that “[i]t\nwould not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have\ngranted Skilling’s transfer motion.” 554 F. 3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009).\nSkilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers\nclaim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth\nCircuit, see id., at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. ante, at\n12, n. 11.\n22               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the “wide\ndiscretion” owed to trial courts when it comes to jury­\nrelated issues. Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20–\n21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public\nsentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox­\nimity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons\nin the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.\n“[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an\nindependent evaluation of the circumstances.” Sheppard,\n384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well\nqualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented\nprocedures adequate to keep community prejudices from\ninfecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not\nbefit the circumstances of the case, the trial court’s rulings\non impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See\nMorgan, 504 U. S., at 729–730 (“ ‘Without an adequate\nvoir dire the trial judge’s responsibility to remove prospec­\ntive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the\ncourt’s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be\nfulfilled’ ” (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451\nU. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also\nMu’Min, 500 U. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Our\nwillingness to accord substantial deference to a trial\ncourt’s finding of juror impartiality rests on our expecta­\ntion that the trial court will conduct a sufficient voir dire\nto determine the credibility of a juror professing to be\nimpartial”).\n                             1\n   As the Court of Appeals apprehended, the District Court\ngave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public\nhostility. For Houstonians, Enron’s collapse was an event\nof once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the\nvolume of media coverage “immense” and frequently in­\ntemperate, but “the sheer number of victims” created a\nclimate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthe desire for conviction was widely shared. 554 F. 3d, at\n559–560.\n   The level of public animus toward Skilling dwarfed that\npresent in cases such as Murphy and Mu’Min. The pre­\ntrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news\nreports, most of which were “largely factual in nature.”\nMurphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no indication that\nthe relevant communities had been captivated by the\ncases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In\ncontrast, the number of media reports in this case reached\nthe tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of\nSkilling were common. The much closer analogy is thus to\nIrvin, which similarly featured a “barrage” of media cover­\nage and a “huge . . . wave of public passion,” 366 U. S., at\n725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve\ndirect harm to entire segments of the community.10\n   Attempting to distinguish Irvin, the majority suggests\nthat Skilling’s economic offenses were less incendiary than\nIrvin’s violent crime spree and that “news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­\nmation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies\nand murders.” Ante, at 28. Along similar lines, the Dis­\ntrict Court described “the facts of this case [as] neither\nheinous nor sensational.” App. to Brief for United States\n10a. The majority also points to the four years that\npassed between Enron’s declaration of bankruptcy and the\nstart of Skilling’s trial, asserting that “the decibel level of\nmedia attention diminished somewhat” over this time.\nAnte, at 17. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n   First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread\ncommunity outrage more readily than crimes involving\nmonetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of\n——————\n 10 One of Skilling’s experts noted that, “[i]n cases involving 200 or\n\nmore articles, trial judges granted a change of venue 59% of the time.”\nApp. ¶30, p. 611a.\n24                    SKILLING v.

Indeed, the record in this case is\nreplete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling\nand other Enron executives. See, e.g., Record 39946\n(front-page, eve-of-trial story describing “the hurt and\nanger and resentment . . . churn[ing] inside” the people of\nHouston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other\nthings, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terror­\nist.11 As one commentator observed, “[i]t’s a sign of how\nshocked Houstonians are about Enron’s ignominious\ndemise that Sept. 11 can be invoked—and is frequently—\nto explain the shock of the company’s collapse.” 3 Supp.\nRecord 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and\nother top executives hired private security to protect\nthemselves from persons inclined to take the law into their\nown hands. See, e.g., App. 1154a (“After taking the tem­\nperature of Enron’s victims, [a local lawyer] says the\nEnron executives are wise to take security precautions”).\n   Second, the passage of time did little to soften commu­\nnity sentiment.

The Enron\nstory was a continuing saga, and “publicity remained\nintense throughout.” 554 F. 3d, at 560. Not only did\nEnron’s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but\nso too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related\nevents.12 Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty\nplea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling’s\ntrial. If anything, the time that elapsed between the\nbankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an\nunbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members\nof the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related\nguilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their\ncertainty that Skilling too had engaged in—if not master­\nminded—criminal acts, particularly given that the media\n——————\n  12 Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress,\n\nand other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights;\nEnron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and\nsentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force\ncharged Enron CFO and Skilling-protégé Andrew Fastow with fraud,\nmoney laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees\npleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task\nForce indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr.\n(the company’s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant\ntreasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband\nServices; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received\nprison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.\nIn 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and\nCausey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding\nLay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered\nguilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers\nwere defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal\ninvolving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held\nin Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various\npretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay,\nand Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey\npleaded guilty to securities fraud.\n26                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncoverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7–8. The trial\nof Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had\ncome before. See Record 40002 (noting that “prosecutors\nfollowed the classic pattern of working their way up\nthrough the ranks”). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,\nshortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services\nexecutives ended without convictions, “The real trial, the\ntrue measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu­\nary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We’ve got\nbigger fish in need of frying.” App. 1460a (paragraph\nbreaks omitted); see also ibid. (“From the beginning, the\nEnron prosecution has had one true measure of success:\nLay and Skilling in a cold steel cage”).\n   Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston\ncommunity remained overwhelmingly negative was dis­\npelled by prospective jurors’ responses to the written\nquestionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5–7,\nmore than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew\nvictims of Enron’s collapse or were victims themselves,\nand two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen­\ndant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling\nwas palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of\nthe prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re­\nsponses. And this was before Causey’s guilty plea and the\nflurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of\ntrial. One of Skilling’s experts, a political scientist who\nhad studied pretrial publicity “for over 35 years” and\nconsulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he\nhad recommended against venue changes more often than\nnot), “c[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of\nbias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at\nleast one of the very highest I have ever encountered.”\nApp. ¶¶2, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).\n                              2\n     Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n362. As this Court has recognized, “[i]n a community\nwhere most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying preju­\ndice, the reliability of the others’ protestations may be\ndrawn into question.” Murphy, 421 U. S., at 803; see also\nGroppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 510 (1971) (“ ‘[A]ny\njudge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms\nthey are extremely likely to be impregnated by the envi­\nroning atmosphere’ ” (quoting Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.\n309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps be­\ncause it had underestimated the public’s antipathy toward\nSkilling, the District Court’s 5-hour voir dire was mani­\nfestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.13\n  As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not\n——————\n  13 The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the\n\nthree previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were simi­\nlarly brief. See ante, at 23. The circumstances of those cases, however,\nwere very different. In particular, the defendants had not been person­\nally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism\nthat had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, e.g.,\nsupra, at 25–26, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely\nseen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclu­\nsion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice\nto select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the\nprocesses used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.\n  Moreover, in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case, I do\nnot mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the\nadequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one,\nshould be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always\ntake care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a\ndefendant’s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court­\nled versus attorney-led voir dire. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,\nand I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial\njury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the\nscope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.\n28                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npursued at all. The majority accepts, for instance, that\n“publicity about a codefendant’s guilty plea calls for in­\nquiry to guard against actual prejudice.” Ante, at 19.\nImplying that the District Court undertook this inquiry,\nthe majority states that “[o]nly two venire members re­\ncalled [Causey’s] plea.” Ibid. In fact, the court asked very\nfew prospective jurors any questions directed to their\nknowledge of or feelings about that event.14 Considering\nhow much news the plea generated, many more than two\nvenire members were likely aware of it. The lack of ques­\ntioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea\non those jurors impossible to assess.\n   The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to de­\nscribe personal interactions they may have had about the\ncase, or to consider whether they might have difficulty\navoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or\ncolleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The\ntidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects\nprovided cause for concern. In response to general media­\nrelated questions, several prospective jurors volunteered\nthat they had spoken with others about the case. Juror\n74, for example, indicated that her husband was the “news\nperson,” that they had “talked about it,” that she had also\nheard things “from work,” and that what she heard was\n“all negative, of course.” App. 948a. The court, however,\ndid not seek elaboration about the substance of these\ninteractions. Surely many prospective jurors had similar\n\n——————\n  14 Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court’s\n\nquestion about whether he “recall[ed] listening to any particular\nprograms about the case.” App. 888a. Juror 96, meanwhile, told the\ncourt that he read the “whole” Houston Chronicle every day, including\n“all the articles about Enron.” Id., at 992a. The court, however, did not\nask any questions designed to elicit information about the Causey plea.\nInstead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling’s counsel\nmanaged to squeeze in a follow-up as to whether he had “read about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two.” Id., at 993a.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Yet this too was a subject\nthe District Court did not adequately explore. On the few\noccasions when prospective jurors were asked whether\nthey would feel pressure from the public to convict, they\nacknowledged that it might be difficult to return home\nafter delivering a not-guilty verdict. Juror 75, for in­\nstance, told the court, “I think a lot of people feel that\nthey’re guilty. And maybe they’re expecting something to\ncome out of this trial.” Id., at 956a. It would be “tough,”\nshe recognized, “to vote not guilty and go back into the\ncommunity.” Id., at 957a; see also id., at 852a (Juror 10)\n(admitting “some hesitancy” about “telling people the\ngovernment didn’t prove its case”).\n  With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the\nDistrict Court’s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly\ntroubling.15 Although Juror 101 responded in the negative\nwhen asked whether she had “read anything in the news­\npaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,” she volunteered that\nshe “just heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling\nand Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and\nthat there was an insurance policy that they could collect\non, also.” Id., at 998a. This information, she explained,\n“was just something I overheard today—other jurors\ntalking.” Ibid. It seemed suspicious, she intimated, “to\nhave an insurance policy ahead of time.” Id., at 999a. The\ncourt advised her that “most corporations provide insur­\nance for their officers and directors.” Ibid. The court,\nhowever, did not investigate the matter further, even\n——————\n  15 Portions of the voir dire transcript erroneously refer to this pro­\n\nspective juror as “Juror 110.” See, e.g., id., at 996a.\n30                 SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthough it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to\ntalk to each other about the case. Id., at 843a. It is thus\nnot apparent whether other prospective jurors also over­\nheard the information and whether they too believed that\nit reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar­\nent what other outside information may have been shared\namong the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101’s\nstatements indicate that the court’s questions were failing\nto bring to light the extent of jurors’ exposure to poten­\ntially prejudicial facts and that some prospec-\ntive jurors were having difficulty following the court’s\ndirectives.\n   The topics that the District Court did cover were ad­\ndressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were\nasked just a few yes/no questions about their general\nexposure to media coverage and a handful of additional\nquestions concerning any responses to the written ques­\ntionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their\nanswers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely\nsought to draw them out with open-ended questions about\ntheir impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited\npatience for counsel’s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at\n\n\n——————\n  16 Thecourt’s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:\n  “Q.

See\nid., at 863a (“[H]e said he thought that he would find them\nguilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said\nthat it would be worse than a German trying to say that\nthey didn’t kill the Jews”).19 Other jurors may well have\nencountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary\nrhetoric.\n  These deficiencies in the form and content of the voir\n——————\n  17 The  majority’s criticism of Skilling’s counsel for failing to ask ques­\ntions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. ante, at 23–24, is thus\nmisplaced. Given the District Court’s express warning early in the voir\ndire that it would not allow counsel “to ask individual questions if\n[they] abuse[d]” that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for\ndeclining to test the court’s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the\ncourt’s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave\ncounsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.\n   18 Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the com­\n\nmunity hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial\npublicity, acknowledging that “all of us have been exposed to substan­\ntial media attention about this case.” Id., at 841a. The court even\nmade an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions,\n“the Nigerian barge case,” apparently expecting that the prospective\njurors would understand the reference. Id., at 840a.\n   19 Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective ju­\n\nrors, Juror 17 stated that he “thought the guy [on the radio] was pretty\nnarrow minded,” that “everyone should be considered innocent totally\nuntil they get a chance to come [to] court,” and that the Government\nmight have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions.\nId., at 863a–864a. He added, however, that he “believe[d] there was\nprobably some accounting fraud [at Enron].” Id., at 864a. The District\nCourt denied the Government’s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,\nbut he did not ultimately sit on the jury.\n32                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ndire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis­\ntrict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment\nof prospective jurors’ assurances of impartiality. Although\nthe Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran­\nscript indicates that the District Court essentially took\njurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In­\ndeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec­\ntive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar­\ntiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.\nJuror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that\nSkilling was “not an honest man.” App. 881a. During\nquestioning, she acknowledged having previously thought\nthe defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost\n$50,000–$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron’s col­\nlapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that\nshe would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,\n884a. Noting that she “blame[d] Enron for the loss of her\nmoney” and appeared to have “unshakeable bias,” Skill­\ning’s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The\ncourt, however, declined to remove her, stating that “she\nanswered candidly she’s going to have an open mind now”\nand “agree[ing]” with the Government’s assertion that “we\nhave to take her at her word.” Id., at 885a–886a.20 As\n——————\n  20 The  majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by\nnoting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a\nperemptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 32. The\nmajority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members\nwho were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments\nof these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar­\ntiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly “part of a community\ndeeply hostile to the accused” and who may have been “unwittingly\ninfluenced by it.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also\nIrvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the\nDistrict Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror\n29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it\nthrough to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi­\ndence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    33\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthis Court has made plain, jurors’ assurances of impartial­\nity simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic signifi­\ncance. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (“[T]he juror’s\nassurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi­\ntive of the accused’s rights”); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728\n(“Where so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a\nstatement of impartiality can be given little weight”).\n   Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions\naccepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal\non their face. Prospective jurors who “hope[d]” they could\npresume innocence and did “not necessarily” think Skill­\ning was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.\n932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her\nquestionnaire, “Shame on him.” Id., at 931a. Asked by\nthe court about this, she stated that, “innocent or guilty,\nhe was at the helm” and “should have known what was\ngoing on at the company.” Ibid.; see also id., at 934a\n(Skilling is “probably” “in the same boat as” Lay). The\ncourt then asked, “can you presume, as you start this trial,\nthat Mr. Lay is innocent?” Id., at 932a. She responded, “I\nhope so, but you know. I don’t know. I can’t honestly\nanswer that one way or the other.” Ibid.; see also id., at\n933a (“I bring in my past history. I bring in my biases. I\nwould like to think I could rise above those, but I’ve never\nbeen in this situation before. So I don’t know how I could\nhonestly answer that question one way or the other. . . . I\ndo have some concerns”). Eventually, however, Juror 61\nanswered “Yes” when the court asked if she would be able\nto acquit if she had “a reasonable doubt that the defen­\ndants are guilty.” Id., at 933a–934a. Challenging her for\ncause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received\n“a clear and unequivocal answer” about her ability to be\n—————— \n\nlittle is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave §23.2(f), at 288 (“The\n\nresponses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated\n\njurors who were familiar with the same publicity”). \n\n34                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nfair. Ibid. The court denied the challenge, stating, “You\nknow, she tried.” Ibid.\n                               3\n  The majority takes solace in the fact that most of the\npersons actually seated as jurors and alternates “specifi­\ncally stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron­\nrelated news.” Ante, at 24–25, and n. 26.21 In context,\nhowever, these general declarations reveal little about the\nseated jurors’ actual knowledge or views or the possible\npressure they might have felt to convict, and thus cannot\ninstill confidence that the jurors “were not under [the]\nsway” of the prevailing community sentiment. Cf. ante, at\n25. Jurors who did not “get into details” of Enron’s com­\nplicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless\nknew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that\nSkilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.\nJuror 63, for instance, told the court that she “may have\nheard a little bit” about Enron-related litigation but had\nnot “really pa[id] attention.” Id., at 935a. Yet she was\nclearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire,\ndespite stating that she had not followed Enron-related\nnews, she wrote about “whistleblowers and Arthur Ander­\nsen lying about Enron’s accounting,” and she expressed\nthe view that Skilling and Lay “probably knew they were\nbreaking the law.” Supp. App. 105sa–106sa. During\nquestioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District\nCourt obtained no meaningful information about the\nactual extent of Juror 63’s familiarity with the case or the\nbasis for her belief in Skilling’s guilt. Yet it nevertheless\n——————\n  21 The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors\n\nand alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection. Ante, at\n24, and n. 25. This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and\nalternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost\njobs or money as a result of Enron’s collapse—a fact that does not strike\nme as particularly reassuring.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

App. 937a.22\n   Indeed, the District Court’s anemic questioning did little\nto dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numer­\nous other seated jurors and alternates. In my estimation,\nmore than half of those seated made written and oral\ncomments suggesting active antipathy toward the defen­\ndants. The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts\nthat “Skilling’s seated jurors . . . exhibited nothing like the\ndisplay of bias shown in Irvin.” Ante, at 29. Juror 10, for\ninstance, reported on his written questionnaire that he\nknew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he\npersonally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual\nfund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from\nthe “Houston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels,\nFox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]\nTexas Lawyer Magazine”; that he believed Enron’s col­\nlapse “was due to greed and mismanagement”; that “[i]f\n[Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he\nwas really a poor manager/leader”; and that the defen­\ndants were “suspect.” Supp. App. 11sa–19sa. During\nquestioning, he said he “th[ought]” he could presume\ninnocence and “believe[d]” he could put the Government to\nits proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have\n“some hesitancy” “in telling people the government didn’t\nprove its case.” App. 851a–852a.\n——————\n  22 As one of Skilling’s jury experts observed, there is a “tendency in\nvoir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their\nexposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any\nbiases they may have.” App. 763a; see also id., at 637a (“Those who\nperceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluc­\ntant to admit they cannot be fair”). For this reason, the fact that “none\nof the seated jurors and alternates checked the ‘yes’ box” on the written\nquestionnaire when “asked whether they ‘ha[d] an opinion about\n[Skilling],’ ” ante, at 26, is of minimal significance, particularly given\nthat the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant\nmedia coverage after the questionnaires were submitted.\n36                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Juror 11 wrote that he “work[ed] with someone who\nworked at Enron”; that he got Enron-related news from\nthe “Houston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13\nNews, O’Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co­\nworkers”; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site;\nthat “greed on Enron’s part” caused the company’s col­\nlapse; and that “a lot of people were hurt financially.”\nSupp. App. 26sa–30sa. During questioning, he stated that\nhe would have “no problem” requiring the Government to\nprove its case, but he also told the court that he believed\nLay was “greedy” and that corporate executives are often\n“stretching the legal limits . . . . I’m not going to say that\nthey’re all crooks, but, you know.” App. 857a, 854a.\nAsked whether he would “star[t] the case with sort of an\ninkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done\nsomething illegal,” he offered an indeterminate “not neces­\nsarily.” Id., at 857.23\n——————\n  23 Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly trou­\n\nbling sentiments. See, e.g., Supp. App. 57sa–60sa (Juror 20) (obtained\nEnron-related news from the Chronicle and “local news stations”;\nblamed Enron’s collapse on “[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective\naudit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets”; and\nwas “angry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement\nsavings”); id., at 72sa–75sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news\nfrom various sources, including the Chronicle; was “angry about what\nhappened”; and “fe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and invested in\nthe corp[oration] only to have it all taken away”); id., at 117sa–118sa\n(Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money;\nheard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as\n“sad” because “people lost jobs [and] money—lots of money”; and\nbelieved the Government “did the right thing” in its investigation); id.,\nat 177sa–181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the\nChronicle, Channel 13 news, the O’Reilly Factor, Internet news sources,\nand friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron’s collapse to\n“[p]oor management [and] bad judgment—greed”; lamented “[t]he sad\nstate of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their\nretirement accounts”; and “admire[d] [the] bravery” of Enron whistle­\nblower Sherron Watkins “for bringing the situation to the attention of\nthe public, which stopped things from getting worse”); id., at 191sa–\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Juror 13, for\ninstance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard\nabout the Enron cases from the “[n]ews.” Supp. App. 42sa.\nThe court questioned him for two minutes, during which\ntime he confirmed that he had “heard what’s on the news,\nbasically,” including “that the trial had moved from the\n17th to the 31st.” He added that the story “was all over\nthe news on every detail of Enron.” App. 858a–860a. No\nmeaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes\nwas obtained. Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not\nfollowed Enron-related news but was aware that “[m]any\npeople lost their jobs.” Supp. App. 151sa. The court ques­\ntioned her for less than 90 seconds. During that time, she\nacknowledged that she had “caught glimpses” of the cov­\nerage and “kn[e]w generally, you know, that the company\nwent bankrupt” and that there “were some employees that\nwent off and did their own businesses.” App. 969a. Little\nmore was learned.24\n——————\n195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news from his wife, co-workers,\nand television; wrote that “[i]t’s not right for someone . . . to take” away\nthe money that the “small average worker saves . . . for retirement all\nhis life”; and described the Government’s Enron investigation as “a\ngood thing”); id., at 221sa–225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information\nabout Enron from a “co-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs.\nFastow’s trial”; worked for an employer who lost money as a result of\nEnron’s collapse; found it “sad” that the collapse had affected “such a\nhuge number of people”; and thought “someone had to be doing some­\nthing illegal”); id., at 236sa–237sa (Juror 116) (knew a colleague who\nlost money in Enron’s collapse; obtained Enron-related news from the\n“Houston Chronicle, Time Magazine, local TV news [and] radio, friends,\nfamily, [and] co-workers, [and] internet news sources”; and noted\nthat what stood out was “[t]he employees and retirees that lost their\nsavings”).\n  24 Several other jurors fell into this category. Juror 67 wrote on his\n38                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In assessing the likelihood that bias lurked in the minds\nof at least some of these seated jurors, I find telling the\nway in which voir dire played out. When the District\nCourt asked the prospective jurors as a group whether\nthey had any reservations about their ability to presume\ninnocence and put the Government to its proof, only two\nanswered in the affirmative, and both were excused for\ncause. Id., at 815a–820a. The District Court’s individual\nquestioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying\nprejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors\nwho had earlier expressed no concerns about their impar­\ntiality. See n. 7, supra. It thus strikes me as highly likely\nthat at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that\nthey could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more\nprobing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. Yount,\n467 U. S., at 1034, n. 10 (holding that the trial court’s\n“particularly extensive” 10-day voir dire assured the jury’s\nimpartiality).25\n——————\nquestionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle and\n“Internet news sources.” Id., at 133sa. He was questioned for 90\nseconds, during which time he indicated that he had read an article on\nthe Internet the preceding night “about the jury selection taking place\ntoday, stuff like that.” App. 944a. Juror 99 wrote that she had not\nheard or read about the Enron cases and did not “know anything about”\nEnron. Supp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely\none minute. She stated that she had “[n]ot really” learned more about\nthe case, but added that she had heard “this and that” from her par­\nents. App. 995a–996a. The court did not press further.\n  25 The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling “challenged only\n\none of the seated jurors for cause” indicates that he did not believe the\nother jurors were biased. Ante, at 31. Our decisions, however, distin­\nguish claims involving “the partiality of an individual juror” from\nantecedent claims directed at “the partiality of the trial jury as a\nwhole.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036 (1984); see also Frazier v.\nUnited States, 335 U. S. 497, 514 (1948) (“[T]he two sorts of challenge[s]\nare distinct and are therefore to be dealt with separately”). If the jury\nselection process does not, as here, give a defendant a fair opportunity\nto identify biased jurors, the defendant can hardly be faulted for failing\nto make for-cause challenges.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

This argument,\nhowever, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vin­\ndictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely\nbelieve in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor\ndisqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit\nwhere evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously\nresolving closer calls against the defendant rather than\ngiving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–1394. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nFounded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in\n  Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company\n  in America. Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was\n  Enron’s chief executive officer from February until August 2001,\n  when he resigned. Less than four months later, Enron crashed into\n  bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value. After an investigation\n  uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron’s stock prices by\n  overstating the company’s financial well-being, the Government\n  prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the\n  scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of\n  command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.\n  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme\n  to deceive investors about Enron’s true financial performance by ma\n  nipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false\n  and misleading statements. Count 1 of the indictment charged Skill\n  ing with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire\n  fraud, 18 U. S. C. §§371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its\n  shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services. Skilling\n  was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud,\n  wire fraud, making false representations to Enron’s auditors, and in\n  sider trading.\n     In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contend\n  ing that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pre\n  trial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. He submitted hundreds\n  of news reports detailing Enron’s downfall, as well as affidavits from\n  experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in\n  comparison to other potential venues. The District Court denied the\n  motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presump\n2                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\n    Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed,\n    media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional,\n    and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational. More\n    over, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.\n       In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for ques\n    tions it might use to screen prospective jurors. Rejecting the Gov\n    ernment’s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling’s more probing and\n    specific questions, the court converted Skilling’s submission, with\n    slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document. The\n    questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news\n    and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron\n    and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and\n    their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\n    and to anyone affected by its demise. The court then mailed the\n    questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from\n    nearly all of them. It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 indi\n    viduals, and the parties, with the court’s approval, further winnowed\n    the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical dis\n    ability. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospec\n    tive juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the de\n    fendants would prevent her from being impartial.\n       In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skill\n    ing’s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty. Skilling re\n    newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror question\n    naires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey’s\n    guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. The court again declined to\n    move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided\n    safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. The court also de\n    nied Skilling’s request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that\n    potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with law\n    yers. But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask\n    follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined\n    individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants\n    jointly two extra peremptory challenges.\n       Voir dire began in January 2006. After questioning the venire as a\n    group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking\n    each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any\n    stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers\n    that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permit\n    ted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties’\n    challenges for cause. Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective\n    jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to\n    empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates. After a 4-month trial, the jury\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud\n  conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.\n     On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here. First, he\n  contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented\n  him from obtaining a fair trial. Second, he alleged that the jury im\n  properly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire\n  fraud. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that\n  the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron’s\n  collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. Stating, however,\n  that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire,\n  found it “proper and thorough,” and held that the District Court had\n  empaneled an impartial jury. The Court of Appeals also rejected\n  Skilling’s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to\n  commit honest-services fraud. It did not address Skilling’s argument\n  that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his ac\n  tions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.\nHeld:\n    1. Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skill\n ing from obtaining a fair trial. He did not establish that a presump\n tion of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\n tried him. Pp. 11–34.\n       (a) The District Court did not err in denying Skilling’s requests\n for a venue transfer. Pp. 11–19.\n         (1) Although the Sixth Amendment and Art. III, §2, cl. 3, pro\n vide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was\n committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer\n of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice\n will prevent a fair trial. Pp. 11–12.\n         (2) The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice\n from which the Fifth Circuit’s analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisi\n ana, 373 U. S. 723. Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kid\n naped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interro\n gated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his\n confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised\n three times to large local audiences shortly before trial. After the\n Louisiana trial court denied Rideau’s change-of-venue motion, he was\n convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal. This\n Court reversed. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and\n heard it,” the Court explained, the interrogation “in a very real sense\n was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded guilty.”             Id., at 726.\n “[W]ithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire,” the Court held that\n the “kangaroo court proceedings” trailing the televised confession vio\n lated due process. Id., at 726–727. The Court followed Rideau in two\n other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal\n4                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    prosecutions. However, it later explained that those decisions “can\n    not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . .\n    news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the de\n    fendant of due process.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798–799.\n    Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror\n    impartiality does not require ignorance. See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366\n    U. S. 717, 722. A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme\n    case. Pp. 12–16.\n           (3) Important differences separate Skilling’s prosecution from\n    those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice. First, the\n    Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community\n    in which the crime occurred. In contrast to the small-town setting in\n    Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation’s\n    fourth most populous city. Given the large, diverse pool of residents\n    eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals\n    could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain. Second, al\n    though news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no\n    blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau’s dramatically\n    staged admission of guilt. Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in\n    which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years\n    elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skilling’s trial. Although\n    reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the\n    decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years\n    following Enron’s collapse. Finally, and of prime significance, Skill\n    ing’s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly,\n    earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelm\n    ing victory for the Government. It would be odd for an appellate\n    court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors’ actions run\n    counter to that presumption. Pp. 16–18.\n           (4) The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily\n    on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed\n    at Enron. But “pretrial publicity—even pervasive, adverse public\n    ity—does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press\n    Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554. Here, news stories about Enron\n    did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court\n    has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Hous\n    ton’s size and diversity diluted the media’s impact. Nor did Enron’s\n    sheer number of victims trigger a presumption. Although the wide\n    spread community impact necessitated careful identification and in\n    spection of prospective jurors’ connections to Enron, the extensive\n    screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose\n    links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated. Finally, while\n    Causey’s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial\n    created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropri\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nate steps to mitigate that risk. Pp. 18–19.\n     (b) No actual prejudice contaminated Skilling’s jury. The Court\nrejects Skilling’s assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect\nand defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.\nPp. 20–34.\n       (1) No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or\nbreadth of voir dire. Jury selection is “particularly within the prov\nince of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594–595.\nWhen pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, “primary reliance on\nthe judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense” be\ncause the judge “sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have\nhad its effect” and may base her evaluation on her “own perception of\nthe depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.”\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427. The Court considers the ade\nquacy of jury selection in Skilling’s case attentive to the respect due\nto district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the\nmeasures necessary to ensure that impartiality. Pp. 20–21.\n       (2) Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of consti\ntutional requirements. The jury-selection process was insufficient,\nSkilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of\nthe District Court’s questions were conclusory and failed adequately\nto probe jurors’ true feelings, and the court consistently took prospec\ntive jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no mat\nter any other indications of bias. This Court’s review of the record,\nhowever, yields a different appraisal. The District Court initially\nscreened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehen\nsive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey\nhelped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served\nas a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmi\nnation of a lengthy process. Moreover, inspection of the question\nnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstand\ning the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors\nlargely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the\ncorporation’s collapse. Whatever community prejudice existed in\nHouston generally, Skilling’s jurors were not under its sway. Relying\non Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727–728, Skilling asserts the District\nCourt should not have accepted jurors’ promises of fairness. But a\nnumber of factors show that the District Court had far less reason\nthan the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors’ assurances of imparti\nality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the\nhorrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin’s rampage of\nrobberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the ru\nral community in which Irvin’s trial proceeded; circulation figures for\nHouston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n6                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    recorded in Irvin; and Skilling’s seated jurors exhibited nothing like\n    the display of bias shown in Irvin. In any event, the District Court\n    did not simply take venire members at their word. It questioned\n    each juror individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face\n    opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with informa\n    tion from the questionnaires regarding jurors’ backgrounds, opinions,\n    and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fit\n    ness for jury service. Pp. 22–30.\n            (3) Skilling’s allegation that several jurors were openly biased\n    also fails. In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district\n    courts is at its pinnacle: “ ‘A trial court’s findings of juror impartiality\n    may be overturned only for manifest error.’ ” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at\n    428. Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the\n    seated jurors for cause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the\n    [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to\n    his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558. A review of\n    the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Ju\n    rors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she\n    would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove\n    its case. Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded\n    with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no\n    signs of prejudice this Court can discern. Pp. 31–34.\n       2. Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of “the\n    intangible right of honest services,” is properly confined to cover only\n    bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged misconduct\n    entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Court’s con\n    finement of §1346’s proscription. Pp. 34–51.\n          (a) To place Skilling’s claim that §1346 is unconstitutionally\n    vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent appli\n    cation of the honest-services doctrine. Pp. 34–38.\n            (1) In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts\n    of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statute’s\n    prohibition of “any scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depriva\n    tions not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.\n    See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110, which stimulated\n    the development of the “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike traditional\n    fraud, in which the victim’s loss of money or property supplied the de\n    fendant’s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest\n    services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.\n    While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no depriva\n    tion of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been\n    deceived, provided the enrichment. Even if the scheme occasioned a\n    money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, ac\n    tionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to the offender’s\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“honest services.” Most often these cases involved bribery of public\nofficials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the\ndoctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to\nhis employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all\nCourts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.\nPp. 34–37.\n        (2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi\nble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,\nwhich held that the mail-fraud statute was “limited in scope to the\nprotection of property rights.” “If Congress desires to go further,” the\nCourt stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid. P. 37.\n        (3) Congress responded the next year by enacting §1346, which\nprovides: “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that\nprohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the\nterm ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” Pp 37–38.\n     (b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti\ntutionally vague. Pp. 38–51.\n        (1) To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people\ncan understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that\ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc\ntrine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that §1346\nmeets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,\nif possible, construe, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to\n§1346’s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how\nbest to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined\nto throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees\nthat §1346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38–39.\n        (2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally\ncases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “the in\ntangible right of honest services.” There is no doubt that Congress\nintended §1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc\ntrine recognized in Courts of Appeals’ decisions before McNally de\nrailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em\nphasis, enacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.\nPp. 39–40.\n        (3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended §1346 to\ncover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its\ncore: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes\nto deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks\n8                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. In parsing the\n    various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skill\n    ing’s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\n    were not models of clarity or consistency. It has long been the\n    Court’s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as imper\n    missibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a\n    limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n    657. Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends\n    that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core be\n    cause the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.\n    This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers,\n    413 U. S., at 571–572. Although some applications of the pre-\n    McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the\n    Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast\n    majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary\n    duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. Indeed, McNally\n    itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U. S., at\n    352–353, 360. In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress\n    intended §1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Because read\n    ing the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would\n    raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that §1346 criminalizes\n    only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.\n    Pp. 41–45.\n            (4) The Government urges the Court to go further by reading\n    §1346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self\n    dealing by a public official or private employee. Neither of the Gov\n    ernment’s arguments in support of this position withstands close in\n    spection. Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on non\n    disclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a\n    classic kickback scheme. See 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. Reading\n    §1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—\n    satisfies Congress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n    Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government’s argument that the\n    pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of\n    the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\n    honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they\n    reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. Given the relative\n    infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies\n    they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting con\n    struction of §1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.\n    Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that “ambigu\n    ity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in\n    favor of lenity.” Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25. The\n    Court therefore resists the Government’s less constrained construc\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion of §1346 absent Congress’ clear instruction otherwise. “If Con\n  gress desires to go further,” the Court reiterates, “it must speak more\n  clearly than it has.” McNally, 483 U. S., at 360. Pp. 45–47.\n          (5) Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\n  schemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. A prohibition on\n  fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest services by accepting\n  bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary\n  prosecution problem. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. As to fair no\n  tice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute\n  honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101,\n  and the statute’s mens rea requirement further blunts any notice\n  concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104. As\n  to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that\n  the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out\n  of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not\n  only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes\n  proscribing and defining similar crimes. Pp. 48–49.\n       (c) Skilling did not violate §1346, as the Court interprets the\n  statute. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to de\n  fraud Enron’s shareholders by misrepresenting the company’s fiscal\n  health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he\n  solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for\n  making these misrepresentations. Because the indictment alleged\n  three objects of the conspiracy—honest-services wire fraud, money\n  or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud—Skilling’s conviction is\n  flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298. This determina\n  tion, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy\n  conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless\n  error analysis. The Court leaves the parties’ dispute about whether\n  the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the\n  question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of\n  Skilling’s other convictions.

SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED \n\n                    STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest­\nrevenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bank­\nruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising\nfrom the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron\nexecutive, for crimes committed before the corporation’s\ncollapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community\nprejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?\nSecond, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of con­\nspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n§§371, 1343, 1346?\n   Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit af­\nfirmed Skilling’s convictions. We conclude, in common\nwith the Court of Appeals, that Skilling’s fair-trial argu­\nment fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a\npresumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias\ninfected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the\nFifth Circuit’s honest-services ruling.      In proscribing\nfraudulent deprivations of “the intangible right of honest\nservices,” §1346, Congress intended at least to reach\nschemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Con­\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstruing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that\ncore meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness\nshoal. We therefore hold that §1346 covers only bribery\nand kickback schemes. Because Skilling’s alleged miscon­\nduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within\n§1346’s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and\nvacate in part.\n                              I\n   Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its\nheadquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world’s\nleading energy companies. Skilling launched his career\nthere in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company’s founder,\nhired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily\nrose through the corporation’s ranks, serving as president\nand chief operating officer, and then, beginning in Febru­\nary 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on\nAugust 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.\n   Less than four months after Skilling’s departure, Enron\nspiraled into bankruptcy. The company’s stock, which had\ntraded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to\npennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend\nwhat caused the corporation’s collapse, the U. S. Depart­\nment of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising\nprosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The\nGovernment’s investigation uncovered an elaborate con­\nspiracy to prop up Enron’s short-run stock prices by over­\nstating the company’s financial well-being. In the years\nfollowing Enron’s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted\ndozens of Enron employees who participated in the\nscheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the\ncorporation’s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand\njury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron’s\nformer chief accounting officer.\n   These three defendants, the indictment alleged,\n    “engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the in­\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

To support this assertion, Skill­\ning, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news\nreports detailing Enron’s downfall; he also presented\naffidavits from the experts he engaged portraying commu­\nnity attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential\nvenues.\n   The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n——————\n   1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or\n\nwires in furtherance of “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain­\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.” 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail fraud); §1343\n(wire fraud). The honest-services statute, §1346, defines “the term\n‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ ” in these provisions to include “a scheme\nor artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.”\n4                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted\nEnron-related prosecutions,2 denied the venue-transfer\nmotion. Despite “isolated incidents of intemperate com­\nmentary,” the court observed, media coverage “ha[d]\n[mostly] been objective and unemotional,” and the facts of\nthe case were “neither heinous nor sensational.” App. to\nBrief for United States 10a–11a.3 Moreover, “courts ha[d]\ncommonly” favored “effective voir dire . . . to ferret out any\n[juror] bias.” Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case,\nthe court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that\nSkilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\nId., at 22a.\n   In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court\nsolicited from the parties questions the court might use to\nscreen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a ques-\ntionnaire’s format and content, Skilling and the Govern­\nment submitted dueling documents. On venire members’\nsources of Enron-related news, for example, the Govern­\n\n——————\n   2 See United States v. Fastow, 292 F. Supp. 2d 914, 918 (SD Tex.\n\n2003); Order in United States v. Hirko, No. 4:03–cr–00093 (SD Tex.,\nNov. 24, 2004), Doc. 484, p. 6. These rulings were made by two other\njudges of the same District. Three judges residing in the area thus\nindependently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could\nobtain a fair trial in Houston.\n   3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding En­\n\nron’s collapse, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion relies heavily on affidavits\nof media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support\nof his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 2, 3, 4, 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 5, n. 2, and\n23, n. 10; post, at 26, and 35, n. 22. These Skilling-employed experts\nselected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories.\nBut the District Court Judge did not find the experts’ samples repre­\nsentative of the coverage at large; having “[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed]\nall of the evidence” Skilling presented, the court concluded that “inci­\ndents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language” were\ndwarfed by “the largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.” App. to\nBrief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a. See also post, at 3 (acknowledging\nthat “many of the stories were straightforward news items”).\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling’s\nquestions “[we]re more helpful,” the court said, “because\n[they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow\nthe potential jurors to give us more meaningful informa­\ntion.” Id., at 9539. The court converted Skilling’s submis­\nsion, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page\ndocument that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia,\ntheir sources of news and exposure to Enron-related pub­\nlicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its col­\nlapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possi­\nble guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\nand to anyone affected by its demise.4\n——————\n  4 Questions included the following: “What are your opinions about the\ncompensation that executives of large corporations receive?”; “Have\nyou, any family members, or friends ever worked for or applied for work\nwith,” “done business with,” or “owned stock in Enron Corporation or\nany Enron subsidiaries and partnership?”; “Do you know anyone . . .\nwho has been negatively affected or hurt in any way by what happened\nat Enron?”; “Do you have an opinion about the cause of the collapse of\nEnron?

In\nthe interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,\narguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive\nbias and that news accounts of Causey’s guilty plea fur­\nther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial\nvenue, Skilling urged that “jurors need to be questioned\nindividually by both the Court and counsel” concerning\ntheir opinions of Enron and “publicity issues.” Id., at\n12074.\n   The District Court again declined to move the trial.\nSkilling, the court concluded, still had not “establish[ed]\nthat pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]\na presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id., at 14115.\nThe questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,\nprovided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.\n\n——————\nthe defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence\npresented during the trial of . . .

I get more forthcoming responses from\n     potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I\n     don’t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers—\n     but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a\n     candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the\n     question.” Id., at 11805.\nBut the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to\nask follow-up questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire\nmembers should be examined individually about pretrial\npublicity, id., at 11051–11053. The court also allotted the\ndefendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than\nthe standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi­\nnal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673–13675.\n   Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court\nfirst emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial­\nity and explained the presumption of innocence and the\nGovernment’s burden of proof. The trial, the court next\ninstructed, was not a forum “to seek vengeance against\nEnron’s former officers,” or to “provide remedies for” its\nvictims. App. 823a. “The bottom line,” the court stressed,\n“is that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, consci­\nentiously and impartially serve if selected.” Id., at 823a–\n824a. In response to the court’s query whether any pro­\nspective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these\ninstructions, two individuals indicated that they could not\nbe fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,\n819a–820a.\n   After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District\nCourt brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench\n——————\n  5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward\n\nthe victims of Enron’s collapse or a desire to see justice done would\noverpower prospective jurors’ impartiality. App. 839a–840a.\n8                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor individual examination. Although the questions var­\nied, the process generally tracked the following format:\nThe court asked about exposure to Enron-related news\nand the content of any stories that stood out in the pro­\nspective juror’s mind. Next, the court homed in on ques­\ntionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible\nbias. The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up\nquestions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away,\nthe court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.\nIn all, the court granted one of the Government’s for-\ncause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the\ndefendants’ challenges and denied six. The parties agreed\nto excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for\nhardship.\n   By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 pro­\nspective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremp­\ntory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.6\nBefore the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the\nseating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in\nfact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used\n——————\n    6 Selection\n              procedures of similar style and duration took place in\nthree Enron-related criminal cases earlier prosecuted in Houston—\nUnited States v.

(fraud and insider-trading charges\nagainst five Enron Broadband Services executives). See Brief for\nUnited States 9 (In all three cases, the District Court “distributed a\njury questionnaire to a pool of several hundred potential jurors; dis­\nmissed individuals whose responses to the questionnaire demonstrated\nbias or other disqualifying characteristics; and, after further question­\ning by the court and counsel, selected a jury from the remaining venire\nin one day.”); Government’s Memorandum of Law in Response to\nDefendants’ Joint Motion to Transfer Venue in United States v.

Supp. App. 3sa–4sa\n(Sealed).7 The court overruled this objection.\n  After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told\nthem they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow\nmedia accounts of the proceedings. “[E]ach of you,” the\ncourt explained, “needs to be absolutely sure that your\ndecisions concerning the facts will be based only on the\nevidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.” App.\n1026a.\n  Following a 4-month trial and nearly five days of delib­\neration, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, includ­\ning the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not\nguilty of 9 insider-trading counts. The District Court\nsentenced Skilling to 292 months’ imprisonment, 3 years’\nsupervised release, and $45 million in restitution.\n  On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his\nconvictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services\narguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the\nFifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and\nnegative tone of media coverage generated by Enron’s\ncollapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554\nF. 3d 529, 559 (2009).8 The court also noted potential\n——————\n   7 Skilling had requested an additional peremptory strike each time\n\nthe District Court rejected a for-cause objection. The court, which had\nalready granted two extra peremptories, see supra, at 7, denied each\nrequest.\n   8 The Fifth Circuit described the media coverage as follows:\n\n   “Local newspapers ran many personal interest stories in which\nsympathetic individuals expressed feelings of anger and betrayal\ntoward Enron. . . . Even the [Houston] Chronicle’s sports page wrote of\nSkilling’s guilt as a foregone conclusion. Similarly, the Chronicle’s\n‘Pethouse Pet of the Week’ section mentioned that a pet had ‘enjoyed\nwatching those Enron jerks being led away in handcuffs.’ These are\nbut a few examples of the Chronicle’s coverage.” 554 F. 3d, at 559\n(footnote omitted).\n10               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice stemming from Causey’s guilty plea and from\nthe large number of victims in Houston—from the\n“[t]housands of Enron employees . . . [who] lost their jobs,\nand . . . saw their 401(k) accounts wiped out,” to Housto­\nnians who suffered spillover economic effects. Id., at 559–\n560.\n   The Court of Appeals stated, however, that “the pre­\nsumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,” and it therefore\nexamined the voir dire to determine whether “the District\nCourt empanelled an impartial jury.” Id., at 561 (internal\nquotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).\nThe voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit’s view, “proper and\nthorough.” Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skill-\ning had challenged only one seated juror—Juror 11—for\ncause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments\nabout corporate greed, the District Court “observed [his]\ndemeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would\nmake the government prove its case.” Id., at 564. In sum,\nthe Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome\nthe presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not\n“show[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced\nagainst him.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling’s claim that\nhis conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit\nhonest-services fraud. “[T]he jury was entitled to convict\nSkilling,” the court stated, “on these elements”: “(1) a\nmaterial breach of a fiduciary duty . . . (2) that results in a\ndetriment to the employer,” including one occasioned by\nan employee’s decision to “withhold material information,\ni.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a\nreasonable employer to change its conduct.” Id., at 547.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling’s argument that\nthe honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude\nhis actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally\nvague.

And even if it had\nbeen possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, “[t]he\ntruncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out\nprejudices,” he contends, so “[f]ar from rebutting the pre­\nsumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively\nconfirmed it.” Id., at 21. Skilling’s fair-trial claim thus\nraises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court\nerr by failing to move the trial to a different venue based\non a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual preju­\ndice contaminate Skilling’s jury?10\n                        A\n                        1\n  The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants\n\n——————\n  9 We   also granted certiorari and heard arguments this Term in two\nother cases raising questions concerning the honest-services statute’s\nscope.

Black, post, p. ___; Weyhrauch, post, p. ___.\n   10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of preju­\n\ndice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling’s petition for\ncertiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when,\nif ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Al­\nthough we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we\nconsider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the\nquestion we agreed to decide. See this Court’s Rule 14.1(a).\n12                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe right to trial by an impartial jury. By constitutional\ndesign, that trial occurs “in the State where the . . .\nCrimes . . . have been committed.” Art. III, §2, cl. 3. See\nalso Amdt. 6 (right to trial by “jury of the State and dis­\ntrict wherein the crime shall have been committed”). The\nConstitution’s place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not\nimpede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at\nthe defendant’s request if extraordinary local prejudice\nwill prevent a fair trial—a “basic requirement of due\nprocess,” In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955).11\n                              2\n  “The theory of our [trial] system is that the conclusions\nto be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence\nand argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­\n——————\n  11 Venue   transfer in federal court is governed by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 21, which instructs that a “court must transfer the\nproceeding . . . to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a\nprejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that\nthe defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.” As the\nlanguage of the Rule suggests, district-court calls on the necessity of\ntransfer are granted a healthy measure of appellate-court respect. See\nPlatt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U. S. 240, 245 (1964).\nFederal courts have invoked the Rule to move certain highly charged\ncases, for example, the prosecution arising from the bombing of the\nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. See\nUnited States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996).\nThey have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in\ncases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact,\nfor example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade\nCenter bombing, see United States v. Salameh, No. S5 93 Cr. 0180\n(KTD) (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); United States v. Yousef, No. S12 93\nCr. 180 (KTD) (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff’d 327 F. 3d 56, 155 (CA2\n2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the\npress as the American Taliban, see United States v. Lindh, 212\nF. Supp. 2d 541, 549–551 (ED Va. 2002). Skilling does not argue,\ndistinct from his due process challenge, that the District Court abused\nits discretion under Rule 21 by declining to move his trial. We there­\nfore review the District Court’s venue-transfer decision only for compli­\nance with the Constitution.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

When\ndoes the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal\ndim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due proc­\ness requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence?\nBecause most cases of consequence garner at least some\npretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in\ndiverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing\nthe presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Cir­\ncuit’s analysis in Skilling’s case proceeded. The founda­\ntion precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723\n(1963).\n   Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana\ntown, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of\nthem. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel\npresent and obtained his confession. Without informing\nRideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the\ninterrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before\nthe trial, a local television station broadcast the film to\naudiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.\nRideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could\nnot receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime oc­\ncurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000\npeople. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury\neventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Lou­\nisiana upheld the conviction.\n   We reversed. “What the people [in the community] saw\non their television sets,” we observed, “was Rideau, in jail,\nflanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in\ndetail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and\nmurder.” Id., at 725. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people\nwho saw and heard it,” we explained, the interrogation “in\na very real sense was Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded\nguilty.” Id., at 726. We therefore “d[id] not hesitate to\nhold, without pausing to examine a particularized tran­\n14                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscript of the voir dire,” that “[t]he kangaroo court proceed­\nings” trailing the televised confession violated due process.\nId., at 726–727.\n    We followed Rideau’s lead in two later cases in which\nmedia coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.\nIn Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive\npublicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure\nduring preliminary court proceedings as reporters and\ntelevision crews overran the courtroom and “bombard[ed]\n. . . the community with the sights and sounds of” the\npretrial hearing. The media’s overzealous reporting ef­\nforts, we observed, “led to considerable disruption” and\ndenied the “judicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol\nEstes] was entitled.” Id., at 536.\n    Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nnews reporters extensively covered the story of Sam\nSheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant\nwife to death. “[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during\nthe trial and newsmen took over practically the entire\ncourtroom,” thrusting jurors “into the role of celebrities.”\nId., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char­\nacterized as “months [of] virulent publicity about\nSheppard and the murder,” did not alone deny due proc­\ness, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard’s case involved\nmore than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder\nconviction because a “carnival atmosphere” pervaded the\ntrial, id., at 358.\n    In each of these cases, we overturned a “conviction\nobtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted\nby press coverage”; our decisions, however, “cannot be\nmade to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to\n. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively\ndeprives the defendant of due process.” Murphy v.

S. 717, 722 (1961) (Jurors are not required\nto be “totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved”;\n“scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will\nnot have formed some impression or opinion as to the\nmerits of the case.”); Reynolds v.

Pointing to “extensive press coverage” about him,\nMurphy moved to transfer venue. 421 U. S., at 796. The trial court\ndenied the motion and a jury convicted Murphy. We affirmed. Mur­\nphy’s trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings\nat issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723 (1963), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nwhich “entirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a\ndefendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of\nfairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.” 421 U. S., at 799. Voir dire\nrevealed no great hostility toward Murphy; “[s]ome of the jurors had a\nvague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each\nhad some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief\nin the relevance of [his] past to the present case.” Id., at 800 (footnote\nomitted).\n  13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount’s confession to a brutal\n\nmurder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed\ndue to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During\nvoir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an\nopinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates\nadmitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt. 467 U. S., at\n1029–1030.       Nevertheless, we rejected Yount’s presumption-of­\nprejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we\nnoted, were at their height prior to Yount’s first trial, four years before\nthe second prosecution; time had helped “sooth[e] and eras[e]” commu­\nnity prejudice, id., at 1034.\n16                  SKILLING v.

A\npresumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends\nonly the extreme case.\n                             3\n   Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling as­\nserts that we need not pause to examine the screening\nquestionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury’s\nverdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differ­\nences separate Skilling’s prosecution from those in which\nwe have presumed juror prejudice.14\n   First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size\nand characteristics of the community in which the crime\noccurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the mur­\nder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.\nHouston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in\nthe Nation: At the time of Skilling’s trial, more than 4.5\nmillion individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the\nHouston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of\npotential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial indi­\nviduals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 429 (1991) (potential\nfor prejudice mitigated by the size of the “metropolitan\nWashington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a popula­\ntion of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hun­\ndreds of murders are committed each year”); Gentile v.\nState Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1044 (1991) (plurality\nopinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was\ndrawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15\n——————\n  14 Skilling’s reliance on Estes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced;\n\nthose cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings\nduring trial. See supra, at 14. Skilling does not assert that news\ncoverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.\n  15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with\n\nhis first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named\nhim when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not\nkind, they contained no confession or other blatantly\nprejudicial information of the type readers or viewers\ncould not reasonably be expected to shut from sight.\nRideau’s dramatically staged admission of guilt, for in­\nstance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of any­\none who watched it. Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,\n72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he defendant’s own con­\nfession [is] probably the most probative and damaging\nevidence that can be admitted against him.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill­\ning was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of\nthe smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa­\nbility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251–\n252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (“A jury may have difficulty in\ndisbelieving or forgetting a defendant’s opinion of his own\nguilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of\nothers because they may not be well-founded.”).\n  Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a\nwidely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over\nfour years elapsed between Enron’s bankruptcy and Skill­\ning’s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related\nnews throughout this period, the decibel level of media\nattention diminished somewhat in the years following\nEnron’s collapse.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhelming victory for the Government.16 In Rideau, Estes,\nand Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury’s verdict did\nnot undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias. It\nwould be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice\nin a case in which jurors’ actions run counter to that pre­\nsumption. See, e.g., United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867\nF. 2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (“The jury’s ability to discern\na failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes\nindicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and\nreinforces our belief and conclusion that the media cover­\nage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an\nimpartial trial.”).\n                               4\n   Skilling’s trial, in short, shares little in common with\nthose in which we approved a presumption of juror preju­\ndice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion\nbased primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of\nmedia attention directed at Enron. But “pretrial public­\nity—even pervasive, adverse publicity—does not inevita­\nbly lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stu\nart, 427 U. S. 539, 554 (1976). In this case, as just noted,\nnews stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid,\nunforgettable information we have recognized as particu­\nlarly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston’s size and\ndiversity diluted the media’s impact.17\n——————\n  16 As  the United States summarizes, “[i]n Hirko, the jury deliberated\nfor several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly,\nwhich was routinely described as ‘the first Enron criminal trial,’ the\njury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron execu­\ntive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of\nslightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that\nthe true loss . . . was $40 million.” Brief for United States 9–10 (cita­\ntion omitted).\n   17 The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention\n\naimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron’s downfall more generally.\nData submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Although the\nwidespread community impact necessitated careful identi­\nfication and inspection of prospective jurors’ connections to\nEnron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow­\nup voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight\nshows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra,\nat 24, jurors’ links to Enron were either nonexistent or\nattenuated.\n   Finally, although Causey’s “well-publicized decision to\nplead guilty” shortly before trial created a danger of juror\nprejudice, 554 F. 3d, at 559, the District Court took appro­\npriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the\nproceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that\ndevelopment. And during voir dire, the court asked about\nprospective jurors’ exposure to recent publicity, including\nnews regarding Causey. Only two venire members re­\ncalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and\nneither ultimately served on Skilling’s jury. App. 888a,\n993a. Although publicity about a codefendant’s guilty plea\ncalls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does\nnot ordinarily—and, we are satisfied, it did not here—\nwarrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.\n   Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 we conclude\nthat the District Court, in declining to order a venue\nchange, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19\n——————\ntransfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories\nspecifically named him. App. 572a. “[W]hen publicity is about the\nevent, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen\nany prejudicial impact.” United States v. Hueftle, 687 F. 2d 1305, 1310\n(CA10 1982).\n  18 The parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can\n\nbe rebutted, and, if it can, what standard of proof governs that issue.\nCompare Brief for Petitioner 25–35 with Brief for United States 24–32,\n35–36.

See United States v. Wood, 299\nU. S. 123, 145–146 (1936) (“Impartiality is not a technical\nconception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of\nthis mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con­\nstitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is\nnot chained to any ancient and artificial formula.”). Jury\nselection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is “particularly\nwithin the province of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross,\n424 U. S. 589, 594–595 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 424; Yount, 467\nU. S., at 1038; Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.

See Reynolds, 98 U. S., at 156–157. In contrast to\nthe cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in­\nthe-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more inti­\nmate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member’s\nfitness for jury service. We consider the adequacy of jury\nselection in Skilling’s case, therefore, attentive to the\nrespect due to district-court determinations of juror im­\npartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that\nimpartiality.20\n——————\n  20 The  dissent recognizes “the ‘wide discretion’ owed to trial courts\nwhen it comes to jury-related issues,” post, at 22 (quoting Mu’Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427 (1991)), but its analysis of the District\nCourt’s voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness. For\nexample, the dissent faults the District Court for not questioning\nprospective jurors regarding their “knowledge of or feelings about”\nCausey’s guilty plea. Post, at 28. But the court could reasonably\ndecline to ask direct questions involving Causey’s plea to avoid tipping\noff until-that-moment uninformed venire members that the plea had\noccurred. Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to\nfind a way to question venire members about Causey “without mention­\ning anything”). Nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about\nvenire members’ knowledge of the plea; indeed, counsel posed such a\nquestion, id., at 993a; cf. post, at 28, n. 14 (acknowledging that counsel\n“squeeze[d] in” an inquiry whether a venire member had “read about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). From this Court’s lofty and “panoramic”\nvantage point, post, at 22, lines of voir dire inquiry that “might be\nhelpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial” are not hard to\nconceive. Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 425. “To be constitutionally compelled,\nhowever, it is not enough that such questions might be helpful. Rather,\n22                 SKILLING v.

Our review of the record, however,\nyields a different appraisal.21\n   As noted, supra, at 4–6, and n. 4, the District Court\ninitially screened venire members by eliciting their re­\nsponses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large\npart by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospec­\ntive jurors excusable for cause and served as a spring­\nboard for further questions put to remaining members of\nthe array. Voir dire thus was, in the court’s words, the\n“culmination of a lengthy process.” App. 841a; see 554\nF. 3d, at 562, n. 51 (“We consider the . . . questionnaire in\n——————\nthe trial court’s failure to ask these questions must render the defen­\ndant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id., at 425–426. According appro­\npriate deference to the District Court, we cannot characterize jury­\nselection in this case as fundamentally unfair. Cf. supra, at 8, n. 6\n(same selection process was used in other Enron-related prosecutions).\n  21 In addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire, our decisions\n\nhave also “take[n] into account . . . other measures [that] were used to\nmitigate the adverse effects of publicity.” Nebraska Press Assn. v.\nStuart, 427 U. S. 539, 565 (1976). We have noted, for example, the\nprophylactic effect of “emphatic and clear instructions on the sworn\nduty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in\nopen court.” Id., at 564. Here, the District Court’s instructions were\nunequivocal; the jurors, the court emphasized, were duty bound “to\nreach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the\nevidence [they] hear[d] and read in th[e] courtroom.” App. 1026a.\nPeremptory challenges, too, “provid[e] protection against [prejudice],”\nUnited States ex rel.

See\nsupra, at 8, n. 6.23\n   The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware\nof the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity,\nto ensure against jury bias. At Skilling’s urging, the court\nexamined each prospective juror individually, thus pre­\nventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other\nvenire members. See Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 425. To en­\ncourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that\nthere were “no right and wrong answers to th[e] ques­\ntions.” E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling’s re­\nquest for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience,\npotential jurors were “more forthcoming” when the court,\nrather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805.\nThe parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask\nfollow-up questions of every prospective juror brought to\n——————\n   22 The dissent’s analysis undervalues the 77-item questionnaire, a\n\npart of the selection process difficult to portray as “cursory,” post, at 30,\nor “anemic,” post, at 35. Notably, the “open-ended questions about\n[prospective jurors’] impressions of Enron or Skilling” that the dissent\ncontends should have been asked, post, at 30, were asked—on the\nquestionnaire, see supra, at 5–6, n. 4. Moreover, the District Court\ngave Skilling’s counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about\ntheir responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g., App. 869a–870a; id., at\n878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus follow-up opportunity to\ninterrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling’s counsel “clear ave­\nnue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.” But see post, at 31, n. 17. See also\nApp. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (“Judge, for the record, if I don’t ask\nany questions, it’s because the Court and other counsel have covered\nit.”).\n   23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the “Big Five” public ac­\n\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen. See supra, at 8, n. 6. Among media\nreaders and auditors, the name and reputation of Arthur Andersen\nlikely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of\nJeffrey Skilling.

Skilling’s counsel declined to ask\nanything of more than half of the venire members ques­\ntioned individually, including eight eventually selected for\nthe jury, because, he explained, “the Court and other\ncounsel have covered” everything he wanted to know.\nApp. 967a.\n   Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the\nindividuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,\nnotwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection\nprocess successfully secured jurors who were largely un­\ntouched by Enron’s collapse.24 Eleven of the seated jurors\nand alternates reported no connection at all to Enron,\nwhile all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial\nlink. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (“I once met a\nguy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his\nname.”).25 As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alter­\nnates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention\nto Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a–860a (Juror\n\n——————\n  24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury,\n\nthe dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that\njury.

Statements by\nnonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury­\nselection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one\nindicator that the process fulfilled its function.

In the months before Irvin’s trial, “a barrage” of\npublicity was “unleashed against him,” including reports\nof his confessions to the slayings and robberies. Id., at\n725–726. This Court’s description of the media coverage\nin Irvin reveals why the dissent’s “best case” is not an apt\ncomparison:\n    “[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin’s] background,\n    including a reference to crimes committed when a ju­\n    venile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years pre­\n    viously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL\n    charges during the war. He was accused of being a\n    parole violator. The headlines announced his police\n    line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test,\n    had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the\n    six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess.\n    Finally, they announced [Irvin’s] confession to the six\n    murders and the fact of his indictment for four of\n    them in Indiana. They reported [Irvin’s] offer to plead\n    guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the de­\n    termination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to\n    secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had con­\n    fessed to 24 burglaries (the modus operandi of these\n    robberies was compared to that of the murders and\n    the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed\n    the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing\n    [Irvin’s] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin]\n    as remorseless and without conscience but also as\n    having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of\n    doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described\n    as the ‘confessed slayer of six,’ a parole violator and\n    fraudulent-check artist.       [Irvin’s] court-appointed\n    counsel was quoted as having received ‘much criticism\n    over being Irvin’s counsel’ and it was pointed out, by\n28               SKILLING v.

On\n     the day before the trial the newspapers carried the\n     story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of\n     [one victim] as well as ‘the robbery-murder of [a sec­\n     ond individual]; the murder of [a third individual],\n     and the slaughter of three members of [a different\n     family].’ ” Id., at 725–726.\n“[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were\ndelivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in” the county\nwhere the trial occurred, which had a population of only\n30,000; “radio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed\nthat county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the\nsame incidents.” Id., at 725.\n  Reviewing Irvin’s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that\n“the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice” in the commu­\nnity “was clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir\ndire”: “370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those exam­\nined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,”\nand “[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.”\nId., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although\nthese jurors declared they could be impartial, we held\nthat, “[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much\nthat [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so\nhuge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one\nin which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing\nany testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.” Id., at\n728.\n  In this case, as noted, supra, at 17, news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­\nmation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies\nand murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in\ncommon with the rural community in which Irvin’s trial\nproceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media\nsources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling’s seated jurors, moreover, exhib­\nited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin. See\nsupra, at 24–26 (noting, inter alia, that none of Skilling’s\njurors answered “yes” when asked if they “ha[d] an opinion\nabout . . . Skilling”). See also post, at 19 (dissent) (distin­\nguishing Mu’Min from Irvin on similar bases: the “offense\noccurred in [a large] metropolitan . . . area,” media “cover­\nage was not as pervasive as in Irvin and did not contain\nthe same sort of damaging information,” and “the seated\njurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion\nabout the case” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In\nlight of these large differences, the District Court had far\nless reason than did the trial court in Irvin to discredit\njurors’ promises of fairness.\n   The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire\nmembers who proclaimed their impartiality at their\nword.30 As noted, all of Skilling’s jurors had already af­\nfirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no\ntrouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.\nNevertheless, the court followed up with each individually\nto uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to\ngauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information\nfrom the questionnaires regarding jurors’ backgrounds,\nopinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy\nfoundation to assess fitness for jury service. See 554 F. 3d,\nat 562 (The District Court made “thorough” credibility\ndeterminations that “requir[ed] more than just the [venire\n——————\n   30 The court viewed with skepticism, for example, Venire Member\n\n104’s promises that she could “abide by law,” follow the court’s instruc­\ntions, and find Skilling not guilty if the Government did not prove its\ncase, App. 1004a; “I have to gauge . . . demeanor, all the answers she\ngave me,” the court stated, and “[s]he persuaded me that she could not\nbe fair and impartial, so she’s excused,” id., at 1006a.\n30                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmembers’] statements that [they] could be fair.”). The\njury’s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts\nafter nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests\nthe court’s assessments were accurate. See United States\nv. Haldeman, 559 F. 2d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976).31\nSkilling, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell\nshort of constitutional requirements.32\n\n——————\n    31 The dissent asserts that “the Government placed relatively little\n\nemphasis on [these] insider trading counts during its closing argu­\nment.” Post, at 39. As the record shows, however, counsel described in\ndetail the evidence supporting Count 50, one of the insider-trading\ncounts on which the jury returned a not-guilty verdict. See Record\n37008–37010. Skilling, Government counsel asserted, sold “half of his\nstock” based on “material inside information” and then lied in testi­\nmony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by claim­\ning the “only reason [he] sold Enron stock was because of [the] Septem­\nber 11th [terrorist attacks].” Id., at 37009 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As counsel summarized: “Mr. Skilling used our nation’s\ntragedy to cover his tracks. . . . I’d suggest . . . the reason he was lying\nis because he didn’t want [the SEC] to know that he had done it before.\n. . . [T]hat’s Count 50. That’s proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at\n37010.       Regarding the remaining insider-trading counts, counsel\nreminded jurors they had heard similar evidence of Skilling’s other\nsales, and urged them to “conclude, based on the evidence,” that “Skill­\ning had information that he used to sell his stock” at the “key periods in\ntime.” Ibid.\n    32 Skilling emphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who\n\nsuffered from Enron’s collapse because the District Court failed to grant\nhis for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund\nlost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron\nstock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on\nSkilling’s jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory chal­\nlenge. “[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge’s erroneous for­\ncause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently\nconvicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,” we have held, “he has\nnot been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.” United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 307 (2000). Indeed, the “use [of] a\nperemptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error”\nexemplifies “a principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the\nconstitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.” Id., at 316.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            31\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                3\n    Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and\ncontends they were openly biased. See United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 316 (2000) (“[T]he seat­\ning of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause\n. . . require[s] reversal.”). In reviewing claims of this type,\nthe deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: “A\ntrial court’s findings of juror impartiality may be over­\nturned only for manifest error.” Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 428\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover,\nunsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for\ncause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the [other]\njurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as\nto his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557–558\n(1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to\nSkilling’s specific allegations of juror partiality.\n    Skilling contends that Juror 11—the only seated juror\nhe challenged for cause—“expressed the most obvious\nbias.” Brief for Petitioner 35. See also post, at 36 (dis­\nsent). Juror 11 stated that “greed on Enron’s part” trig­\ngered the company’s bankruptcy and that corporate execu­\ntives, driven by avarice, “walk a line that stretches\nsometimes the legality of something.” App. 854a–855a.\nBut, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11\n    “had ‘no idea’ whether Skilling had ‘crossed that line,’\n    and he ‘didn’t say that’ every CEO is probably a crook.\n    He also asserted that he could be fair and require the\n    government to prove its case, that he did not believe\n    everything he read in the paper, that he did not ‘get\n    into the details’ of the Enron coverage, that he did not\n    watch television, and that Enron was ‘old news.’ ” 554\n    F. 3d, at 563–564.\nDespite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that\nSkilling “earned [his] salar[y],” App. 857a, and said he\nwould have “no problem” telling his co-worker, who had\n32                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlost 401(k) funds due to Enron’s collapse, that the jury\nvoted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, id., at 854a.\nThe District Court, noting that it had “looked [Juror 11] in\nthe eye and . . . heard all his [answers],” found his asser­\ntions of impartiality credible. Id., at 858a; cf. supra, at 29,\nn. 30. We agree with the Court of Appeals that “[t]he\nexpress finding that Juror 11 was fair is not reversible\nerror.” 554 F. 3d, at 564.33\n   Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six spe­\ncific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he\nnot already exhausted his peremptory challenges. See\nsupra, at 8–9. Juror 20, he observes, “said she was ‘angry’\nabout Enron’s collapse and that she, too, had been ‘forced\nto forfeit [her] own 401(k) funds to survive layoffs.’ ” Reply\nBrief 13. But Juror 20 made clear during voir dire that\nshe did not “personally blame” Skilling for the loss of her\nretirement account. App. 875a. Having not “pa[id] much\nattention” to Enron-related news, she “quite honestly” did\nnot “have enough information to know” whether Skilling\nwas probably guilty, id., at 873a, and she “th[ought] [she]\ncould be” fair and impartial, id., at 875a. In light of these\nanswers, the District Court did not commit manifest error\nin finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.\n   The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out,\nwrote on her questionnaire “that [Skilling] ‘probably knew\n[he] w[as] breaking the law.’ ” Reply Brief 13. During voir\ndire, however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not “really\nhave an opinion [about Skilling’s guilt] either way,” App.\n936a; she did not “know what [she] was thinking” when\nshe completed the questionnaire, but she “absolutely”\npresumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her under­\nstanding that the Government would “have to prove” his\n——————\n  33 Skilling’s trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not\n\nregard Juror 11 as so “obvious[ly] bias[ed],” Brief for Petitioner 35, as to\nwarrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In response to follow-up questions from\nSkilling’s counsel, she again stated she would not presume\nthat Skilling violated any laws and could “[a]bsolutely”\ngive her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a–938a.\n“Jurors,” we have recognized, “cannot be expected invaria­\nbly to express themselves carefully or even consistently.”\nYount, 467 U. S., at 1039. See also id., at 1040 (“It is here\nthat the federal [appellate] court’s deference must operate,\nfor while the cold record arouses some concern, only the\ntrial judge could tell which of these answers was said with\nthe greatest comprehension and certainty.”). From where\nwe sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.\n   The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have\nexcluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign\nof prejudice we can discern. See App. 891a–892a (Juror\n38) (remembered no media coverage about Enron and said\nnothing in her experience would prevent her from being\nfair and impartial); Supp. App. 131sa–133sa, 136sa (Juror\n67) (had no connection to Enron and no anger about its\ncollapse); App. 969a (Juror 78) (did not “know much about”\nEnron); Supp. App. 165sa, App. 971a (Juror 84) (had not\nheard or read anything about Enron and said she did not\n“know enough to answer” the question whether she was\nangry about the company’s demise). Skilling’s counsel\ndeclined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors\nand, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because\nshe “gave all the right answers.” Id., at 972a. Whatever\nSkilling’s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi­\nviduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis­\nplayed a disqualifying bias.34\n——————\n   34 Although Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at\n\ntrial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for\nPetitioner 14–15; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,\nthe voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that\nthey were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a–853a (Juror 10) (did not\nprejudge Skilling’s guilt, indicated he could follow the court’s instruc­\n34                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption\nof prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\ntried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,\nneed not enter the box with empty heads in order to de­\ntermine the facts impartially. “It is sufficient if the ju­\nror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.”\nIrvin, 366 U. S., at 723. Taking account of the full record,\nrather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from\nit, we find no cause to upset the lower courts’ judgment\nthat Skilling’s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm\nthe Fifth Circuit’s ruling that Skilling received a fair\ntrial.35\n                           III\n   We next consider whether Skilling’s conspiracy convic­\ntion was premised on an improper theory of honest­\nservices wire fraud. The honest-services statute, §1346,\nSkilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna­\ntively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within\nthe statute’s compass.\n                            A\n To place Skilling’s constitutional challenge in context,\nwe first review the origin and subsequent application of\n——————\ntions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair\nto Skilling, and said he would “judge on the facts”); id., at 974a (Juror\n87) (had “not formed an opinion” on whether Skilling was guilty and\naffirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).\n   35 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror\n\nprejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu’Min, 500 U. S. 415;\nPatton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.\n794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest\nconveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a\npremise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions\nwhen they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence\npresented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and\nthe District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe honest-services doctrine.\n                               1\n   Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the\npredecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,\nproscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to\nadvance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” See McNally\nv. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con­\ngress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,\n“any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money\nor property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.” §1341 (emphasis added); see\nid., at 357–358. Emphasizing Congress’ disjunctive phras­\ning, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted\nthe term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include depri­\nvations not only of money or property, but also of intangi­\nble rights.\n   In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi­\nble-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110\n(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu­\ntion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from\nentrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial\nto the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city]\nwas to make and did make a saving by the operations\nthere could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court\nof Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. “A scheme to get a\npublic contract on more favorable terms than would likely\nbe got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court\nobserved, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of\nbribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.”\nId., at 115.\n   The Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Shushan stimulated the\ndevelopment of an “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike\nfraud in which the victim’s loss of money or property\nsupplied the defendant’s gain, with one the mirror image\nof the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,\n36              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor­\nruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender\nprofited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of\nmoney or property; instead, a third party, who had not\nbeen deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a\ncity mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third\nparty in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,\nyet the contract terms were the same as any that could\nhave been negotiated at arm’s length, the city (the be­\ntrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,\n483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,\nactionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to\nthe offender’s “honest services.” See, e.g., United States v.\nDixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).\n   “Most often these cases . . . involved bribery of public\nofficials,” United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167, 1171\n(CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector\nhonest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application\nof the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing\na bribery scheme, explained:\n     “When one tampers with [the employer-employee] re­\n     lationship for the purpose of causing the employee to\n     breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is de­\n     frauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual\n     deception that is practised is in the continued repre­\n     sentation of the employee to the employer that he is\n     honest and loyal to the employer’s interests.” United\n     States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp. 676, 678\n     (Mass. 1942).\n  Over time, “[a]n increasing number of courts” recognized\nthat “a recreant employee”—public or private—“c[ould] be\nprosecuted under [the mail-fraud statute] if he breache[d]\nhis allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kick­\nbacks in the course of his employment,” United States v.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

United States,\nstopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine\nin its tracks. McNally involved a state officer who, in\nselecting Kentucky’s insurance agent, arranged to procure\na share of the agent’s commissions via kickbacks paid to\ncompanies the official partially controlled. 483 U. S., at\n360. The prosecutor did not charge that, “in the absence of\nthe alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid\na lower premium or secured better insurance.” Ibid. In­\nstead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback\nscheme “defraud[ed] the citizens and government of Ken­\ntucky of their right to have the Commonwealth’s affairs\nconducted honestly.” Id., at 353.\n  We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.\n“Rather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that\nleaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the\nFederal Government in setting standards of disclosure and\ngood government for local and state officials,” we read the\nstatute “as limited in scope to the protection of property\nrights.” Id., at 360. “If Congress desires to go further,” we\nstated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid.\n\n\n\n——————\n  36 In addition to upholding honest-services prosecutions, courts also\n\nincreasingly approved use of the mail-fraud statute to attack corruption\nthat deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights, including\nelection fraud and privacy violations. See, e.g., Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 18, n. 2 (2000); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.\n350, 362–364, and nn. 1–4 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n38               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              3\n\n   Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it\nenacted a new statute “specifically to cover one of the\n‘intangible rights’ that lower courts had protected . . . prior\nto McNally: ‘the intangible right of honest services.’ ”\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19–20 (2000). In\nfull, the honest-services statute stated:\n     “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United\n     States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud,\n     §1341, and wire fraud, §1343], the term ‘scheme or\n     artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to\n     deprive another of the intangible right of honest ser­\n     vices.” §1346.\n                              B\n  Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not\nclearly: He asserts that §1346 is unconstitutionally vague.\nTo satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordi­\nnary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461\nU. S. 352, 357 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine\nembraces these requirements.\n  According to Skilling, §1346 meets neither of the two\ndue process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible\nright of honest services,” he contends, does not adequately\ndefine what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38–39.\nSecond, he alleges, §1346’s “standardless sweep allows\npolicemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal\npredilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] opportunistic and\narbitrary prosecutions.” Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461\nU. S., at 358).\n  In urging invalidation of §1346, Skilling swims against\nour case law’s current, which requires us, if we can, to\nconstrue, not condemn, Congress’ enactments. See, e.g.,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  39\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.

S. 29, 32 (1963) (stressing, in response to a\nvagueness challenge, “[t]he strong presumptive validity\nthat attaches to an Act of Congress”). Alert to §1346’s\npotential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on\nhow best to interpret the statute.37 Uniformly, however,\nthey have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia­\nbly vague.38\n   We agree that §1346 should be construed rather than\ninvalidated. First, we look to the doctrine developed in\npre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the mean­\ning of the phrase “the intangible right of honest services.”\nSecond, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the\nstatute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to\nits core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved\nfraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services\nthrough bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who\nhad not been deceived. Confined to these paramount\n——————\n  37 Courts have disagreed about whether §1346 prosecutions must be\n\nbased on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v. Brum\nley, 116 F. 3d 728, 734–735 (CA5 1997) (en banc), with, e.g., United\nStates v. Weyhrauch, 548 F. 3d 1237, 1245–1246 (CA9 2008), vacated\nand remanded, post, p. ___; whether a defendant must contemplate that\nthe victim suffer economic harm, compare, e.g., United States v.

Black, 530 F. 3d 596, 600–602 (CA7 2008), vacated and\nremanded, post, p. ___; and whether the defendant must act in pursuit\nof private gain, compare, e.g., United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napplications, §1346 presents no vagueness problem.\n                               1\n  There is no doubt that Congress intended §1346 to refer\nto and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized\nin Court of Appeals’ decisions before McNally derailed the\nintangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner\n39; Brief for United States 37–38; post, at 2, 8 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress\nenacted §1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision’s terminology. See 483 U. S.,\nat 355 (“intangible righ[t]”); id., at 362 (STEVENS, J., dis­\nsenting) (“right to . . . honest services”).39 As the Second\nCircuit observed in its leading analysis of §1346:\n     “The definite article ‘the’ suggests that ‘intangible\n     right of honest services’ had a specific meaning to\n     Congress when it enacted the statute—Congress was\n     recriminalizing mail- and wire-fraud schemes to de­\n     prive others of that ‘intangible right of honest ser­\n     vices,’ which had been protected before McNally, not\n     all intangible rights of honest services whatever they\n     might be thought to be.” United States v. Rybicki, 354\n     F. 3d 124, 137–138 (2003) (en banc).40\n\n——————\n  39 Although verbal formulations varied slightly, the words employed\n\nby the Courts of Appeals prior to McNally described the same concept:\n“honest services,” e.g., United States v. Bruno, 809 F. 2d 1097, 1105\n(CA5 1987); “honest and faithful services,” e.g., United States v. Brown,\n540 F. 2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); and “faithful and honest services,” e.g.,\nUnited States v. Diggs, 613 F. 2d 988, 998 (CADC 1979).\n  40 We considered a similar Court-Congress interplay in McDermott\n\nInt’l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991), which involved the inter­\npretation of the term “seaman” in the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688\n(2000 ed.). The Act, we recognized, “respond[ed] directly to” our deci­\nsion in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 (1903), and “adopt[ed] without\nfurther elaboration the term used in” that case, so we “assume[d] that\nthe Jones Act use[d] ‘seaman’ in the same way.” 498 U.

See infra, at 43–44, 46. In parsing the Courts of\nAppeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling’s vague­\nness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\npreceding McNally were not models of clarity or consis­\ntency. See Brief for Petitioner 39–42 (describing divisions\nof opinions). See also post, at 3–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nWhile the honest-services cases preceding McNally domi­\nnantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to brib­\nery and kickback schemes—schemes that were the basis of\nmost honest-services prosecutions—there was consider­\nable disarray over the statute’s application to conduct\noutside that core category. In light of this disarray, Skill­\ning urges us, as he urged the Fifth Circuit, to invalidate\nthe statute in toto. Brief for Petitioner 48 (Section 1346 “is\nintolerably and unconstitutionally vague.”); Brief of De­\nfendant-Appellant Jeffrey K. Skilling in No. 06–20885\n(CA5), p. 65, n. 21 (“[S]ection 1346 should be invalidated\nas unlawfully vague on its face.”).\n  It has long been our practice, however, before striking\na federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider\nwhether the prescription is amenable to a limiting con­\nstruction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n657 (1895) (“The elementary rule is that every reasonable\nconstruction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute\nfrom unconstitutionality.” (emphasis added)). See also\nBoos v.

And if this general class of\noffenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reason­\nable construction of the statute, this Court is under a duty\nto give the statute that construction.”).\n  Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling\ncontends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable\nhonest-services core; “the pre-McNally caselaw,” he as­\nserts, “is a hodgepodge of oft-conflicting holdings” that are\n“hopelessly unclear.” Brief for Petitioner 39 (some capi­\ntalization and italics omitted).

Stating that he “know[s] of no\nprecedent for . . . ‘paring down’ ” the pre-McNally case law to its core,\nibid., he contends that the Court today “wield[s] a power we long ago\nabjured: the power to define new federal crimes,” post, at 1. See also,\ne.g., post, at 9, 10, 11. As noted supra, at 41–42, and n. 41, cases\n“paring down” federal statutes to avoid constitutional shoals are legion.\nThese cases recognize that the Court does not legislate, but instead\nrespects the legislature, by preserving a statute through a limiting\ninterpretation. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 267–268,\nn. 6 (1997) (This Court does not “create a common law crime” by adopt­\ning a “narrow[ing] constru[ction].” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nsupra, at 44–45, n. 43. Given that the Courts of Appeals uniformly\nrecognized bribery and kickback schemes as honest-services fraud\nbefore McNally, 483 U. S. 350, and that these schemes composed the\nlion’s share of honest-services cases, limiting §1346 to these heartland\napplications is surely “fairly possible.” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,\n331 (1988); cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380 (2005) (opinion of\nthe Court by SCALIA, J.) (when adopting a limiting construction, “[t]he\nlowest common denominator, as it were, must govern”). So construed,\nthe statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 48–49; post, at\n8. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged\nthrough a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step\nwith precedent.\n46              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand “Congress clearly intended to revive th[at] nondisclo­\nsure theory.” Id., at 44. Moreover, “[a]lthough not as\nnumerous as the bribery and kickback cases,” the Gov­\nernment asserts, “the pre-McNally cases involving undis­\nclosed self-dealing were abundant.” Ibid.\n   Neither of these contentions withstands close inspec­\ntion. McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 37,\n43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public official, in\nexchange for routing Kentucky’s insurance business\nthrough a middleman company, arranged for that com­\npany to share its commissions with entities in which the\nofficial held an interest. 483 U. S., at 352–353, 360. This\nwas no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest;\nrather, the official conspired with a third party so that\nboth would profit from wealth generated by public con­\ntracts. See id., at 352–353. Reading §1346 to proscribe\nbribes and kickbacks—and nothing more—satisfies Con­\ngress’ undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n   Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of­\ninterest cases constitute core applications of the honest­\nservices doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\nhonest-services convictions for “some schemes of non­\ndisclosure and concealment of material information,”\nMandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on\nwhich schemes qualified. In light of the relative infre­\nquency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to\nbribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit incon­\nsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable\nlimiting construction of §1346 must exclude this amor­\nphous category of cases.\n   Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar\nprinciple that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal\nstatutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” Cleveland,\n531 U. S., at 25 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.

The\nGovernment proposes a standard that prohibits the “taking of official\naction by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial\ninterests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he\nowes a fiduciary duty,” so long as the employee acts with a specific\nintent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim\nto change its behavior. Id., at 43–44. See also id., at 40–41. That\nformulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct\nor significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To\nwhat extent does the official action have to further that interest in\norder to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and\nwhat information should it convey? These questions and others call for\nparticular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohi­\nbition in this context.\n48              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               4\n\n   Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\nschemes, §1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. Recall\nthat the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns\nabout (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory\nprosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. A prohibi­\ntion on fraudulently depriving another of one’s honest\nservices by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present\na problem on either score.\n   As to fair notice, “whatever the school of thought con­\ncerning the scope and meaning of ” §1346, it has always\nbeen “as plain as a pikestaff that” bribes and kickbacks\nconstitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951), and the statute’s mens rea\nrequirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g.,\nScrews v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101–104 (1945)\n(plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU. S. 601, 608 (1973) (“[E]ven if the outermost boundaries\nof [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little\nrelevance . . . where appellants’ conduct falls squarely\nwithin the ‘hard core’ of the statute’s proscriptions.”).\nToday’s decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls\nwithin §1346’s province. See United States v. Lanier, 520\nU.

Its prohibition on\nbribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-\nMcNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscrib­\ning—and defining—similar crimes. See, e.g., 18 U. S.

A criminal defendant who participated in\na bribery or kickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably\ncomplain about prosecution under §1346 on vagueness\ngrounds.\n                               C\n    It remains to determine whether Skilling’s conduct\nviolated §1346. Skilling’s honest-services prosecution, the\nGovernment concedes, was not “prototypical.” Brief for\nUnited States 49. The Government charged Skilling with\nconspiring to defraud Enron’s shareholders by misrepre­\nsenting the company’s fiscal health, thereby artificially\ninflating its stock price. It was the Government’s theory\nat trial that Skilling “profited from the fraudulent scheme\n. . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and\nthrough the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron\nstock, which netted him $89 million.” Id., at 51.\n    The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skill­\ning solicited or accepted side payments from a third party\nin exchange for making these misrepresentations. See\nRecord 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government\nto the District Court) (“[T]he indictment does not allege,\nand the government’s evidence did not show, that [Skill­\n——————\n  46 Overlap with other federal statutes does not render §1346 superflu­\n\nous. The principal federal bribery statute, §201, for example, generally\napplies only to federal public officials, so §1346’s application to state\nand local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct\nthat might otherwise go unpunished.\n50                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning] engaged in bribery.”). It is therefore clear that, as we\nread §1346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.\n   Because the indictment alleged three objects of the con-\nspiracy—honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property\nwire fraud, and securities fraud—Skilling’s conviction\nis flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298\n(1957) (constitutional error occurs when a jury is in­\nstructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a\ngeneral verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory).\nThis determination, however, does not necessarily require\nreversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently con­\nfirmed, in Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008) (per\ncuriam), that errors of the Yates variety are subject to\nharmless-error analysis. The parties vigorously dispute\nwhether the error was harmless. Compare Brief for\nUnited States 52 (“[A]ny juror who voted for conviction\nbased on [the honest-services theory] also would have\nfound [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities\nfraud.”) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government “cannot\nshow that the conspiracy conviction rested only on the\nsecurities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally­\nflawed honest-services theory.”). We leave this dispute for\nresolution on remand.47\n   Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count\ntouches any of Skilling’s other convictions is also an open\nquestion. All of his convictions, Skilling contends, hinged\non the conspiracy count and, like dominoes, must fall if it\n\n——————\n  47 The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, “if\n\nany of the three objects of Skilling’s conspiracy offers a legally insuffi­\ncient theory,” it “must set aside his conviction.” 554 F. 3d, at 543. That\nreasoning relied on the mistaken premise that Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555\nU. S. ___ (2008) (per curiam), governs only cases on collateral review.\nSee 554 F. 3d, at 543, n. 10.

UNITED \n\n                    STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, and\nwith whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins except as to Part III,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  I agree with the Court that petitioner Jeffrey Skilling’s\nchallenge to the impartiality of his jury and to the District\nCourt’s conduct of the voir dire fails. I therefore join Parts\nI and II of the Court’s opinion. I also agree that the deci­\nsion upholding Skilling’s conviction for so-called “honest­\nservices fraud” must be reversed, but for a different rea­\nson. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S. C. §1346\n(2006 ed., Supp. II) that “scheme or artifice to defraud” in\nthe mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, §§1341 and 1343\n(2006 ed.), includes “a scheme or artifice to deprive an­\nother of the intangible right of honest services,” is vague,\nand therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility\nin proclaiming that our task is “not to destroy the Act . . .\nbut to construe it,” ante, at 43 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in transforming the prohibition of “honest­\nservices fraud” into a prohibition of “bribery and kick­\nbacks” it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the\npower to define new federal crimes. See United States v.\nHudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\n2                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it\nproscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague\ncannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan\nzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by\njudicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its\ntext does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.\n214, 219–221 (1876). Our cases have described vague\nstatutes as failing “to provide a person of ordinary intelli­\ngence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so\nstandardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri­\nously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Wil\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues\nthat §1346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages\narbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of\nthe right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.\nBrief for Petitioner 38–39, 42–44. In my view Skilling is\ncorrect.\n   The Court maintains that “the intangible right of honest\nservices ” means the right not to have one’s fiduciaries\naccept “bribes or kickbacks.” Its first step in reaching\nthat conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to\n“the doctrine developed” in cases decided by lower federal\ncourts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,\n483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I\nagree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the\nlower-court case law that had been disapproved by\nMcNally—what the Court calls “the pre-McNally honest­\nservices doctrine,” ante, at 43. The problem is that that\ndoctrine provides no “ascertainable standard of guilt,”\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89\n(1921), and certainly is not limited to “bribes or kick­\nbacks.”\n   Investigation into the meaning of “the pre-McNally\nhonest-services doctrine” might logically begin with\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nMcNally itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the\nmany Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the\nmeaning of “fraud” in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat­\nutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483\nU. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi­\ntion of “bribery and kickbacks,” one would have expected\nthose words to appear in the opinion’s description of the\ncases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally\neven provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing\ntheory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right\nof citizens “to have the [State]’s affairs conducted hon­\nestly,” id., at 353, to “honest and impartial government,”\nid., at 355, to “good government,” id., at 356, and “to have\npublic officials perform their duties honestly,” id., at 358.\nIt described prior case law as holding that “a public official\nowes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office\nfor private gain is a fraud,” id., at 355.\n   But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not\nlimited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held\nthat those fiduciaries subject to the “honest services”\nobligation included private individuals who merely par­\nticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.\nGray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295–1296 (CA6 1986) (citing\nUnited States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2\n1982)), and even private employees who had no role in\npublic decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720\nF. 2d 1327, 1335–1336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von\nBarta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, “to say\nthat a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it\ngives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations\ndoes he owe as a fiduciary?” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318\nU. S. 80, 85–86 (1943). None of the “honest services”\ncases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those\npertaining to private employees, defined the nature and\ncontent of the fiduciary duty central to the “fraud” offense.\n   There was not even universal agreement concerning the\n4                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsource of the fiduciary obligation—whether it must be\npositive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.\nRabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen­\neral principles, such as the “obligations of loyalty and\nfidelity” that inhere in the “employment relationship,”\nLemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed\nhad grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)\ntrust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes­\ntooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec­\nond) of Trusts §§169–185 (1976). Another pre-McNally\ncase referred to the general law of agency, United States v.\nBallard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on\nother grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes\nduties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re­\nstatement (Second) of Agency §§377–398 (1957).\n   This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes\nthat the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common­\nlaw fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde­\nfined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad\nlanguage. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5\n1967), loftily declared that “[l]aw puts its imprimatur on\nthe accepted moral standards and condemns conduct\nwhich fails to match the ‘reflection of moral uprightness,\nof fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the\ngeneral and business life of members of society.’ ” Id., at\n671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109\n(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any\nscheme “contrary to public policy” was also condemned by\n——————\n    1 The\n        Court is untroubled by these divisions because “these debates\nwere rare in bribe and kickback cases,” in which “[t]he existence of a\nfiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually\nbeyond dispute,” ante, at 43, n. 42. This misses the point. The Courts\nof Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a\nbribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not\nconsistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a\nfiduciary.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Mandel, 591\nF. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is “contrary\nto public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of\nmoral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and\nright dealing”). Even opinions that did not indulge in such\ngrandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond\nloyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005–\n1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be\ngreater for public officials than for private employees, see,\ne.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,\nn. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never\nmade clear.\n   The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many\ncourts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere\nbreach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest­\nservices fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col­\nlecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512\n(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute\nabout that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing\nduties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d\n234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that\ndid require something additional where a public official\nwas involved, there was disagreement as to what the\naddition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,\n522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate­\nrial misrepresentations and active concealment were\nenough, id., at 647–648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,\nthe Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was\nneeded, id., at 1026.\n   Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private\nemployees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must\nuse his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare\nLemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron\nston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion\nupheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the\n6                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndefendant’s “failure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and\nconsulting fees from [his employer’s] suppliers resulted in\na breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of\nhis loyal and honest services.” United States v. Bryza, 522\nF. 2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however,\ndemanded more than an intentional failure to disclose:\n“There must be a failure to disclose something which in\nthe knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an\nindependent business risk to the employer.” Lemire, 720\nF. 2d, at 1337. Other courts required that the victim\nsuffer some loss, see, e.g., Ballard, supra, at 541–542—a\nproposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981);\nUnited States v. O’Malley, 535 F. 2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).\nThe Court’s statement today that there was a deprivation\nof honest services even if “the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party,” ante, at 36, is\ntherefore true, except to the extent it is not.\n   In short, the first step in the Court’s analysis—holding\nthat “the intangible right of honest services” refers to “the\nhonest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals’\ndecisions before McNally,” ante, at 40—is a step out of the\nfrying pan into the fire. The pre-McNally cases provide no\nclear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of\nhonest services. The possibilities range from any action\nthat is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to\nonly the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his\nprincipal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator’s position\nof trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The\nduty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but\nmaybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the\ncase of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time §1346\nwas enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing\namong these options, for conclusively settling what was in\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

It knows that adopting\nby reference “the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine,”\nante, at 43, is adopting by reference nothing more precise\nthan the referring term itself (“the intangible right of\nhonest services”). Hence the deus ex machina: “[W]e pare\nthat body of precedent down to its core,” ante, at 39. Since\nthe honest-services doctrine “had its genesis” in bribery\nprosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for\nSkilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as “core”\nor “paradigm” or “typical” examples, or “[t]he most obvious\nform,” of honest-services fraud, ante, at 43–44 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel\nfor the Government say that they formed the “vast major­\nity,” or “most” or at least “[t]he bulk” of honest-services\ncases, ante, at 43–44 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nTHEREFORE it must be the case that they are all\nCongress meant by its reference to the honest-services\ndoctrine.\n   Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it\nwould not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the stat­\nute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what\nacts constitute a breach of the “honest services” obligation\nunder the pre-McNally law. But it would not solve the\nmost fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the\n“fiduciary capacity” to which the bribery and kickback\n——————\n   2 Courts since §1346’s enactment have fared no better, reproducing\n\nsome of the same disputes that predated McNally. See, e.g., Sorich v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3–4) (collecting cases). We have previ­\nously found important to our vagueness analysis “the conflicting results\nwhich have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges\nin seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.”\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921). I am at\na loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.\n8                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                             Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nrestriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials?\nOr in addition to private individuals who contract with the\npublic? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer\nhere? The pre-McNally case law does not provide an\nanswer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limita­\ntion the statute does not answer the question “What is the\ncriterion of guilt?”\n   But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvi­\nous that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was\nnot the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and\nkickbacks represented “the core” of the doctrine, or that\nmost cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,\nis not to say that they are the doctrine. All it proves is\nthat the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with\nregard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much\nmore. Among all the pre-McNally smörgåsbord-offerings\nof varieties of honest-services fraud, not one is limited to\nbribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has\ncooked up all on its own.\n   Thus, the Court’s claim to “respec[t] the legislature,”\nante, at 45, n. 44 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely\nclear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to\nreinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law; and\nentirely clear that that prohibited much more (though\nprecisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kick­\nbacks. Perhaps it is true that “Congress intended §1346 to\nreach at least bribes and kickbacks,” ante, at 44. That\nsimply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that “§1346\ncriminalizes only” bribery and kickbacks, ante, at 45.\n   Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation\nbut invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal stan­\ndard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (in­\ncluded within the vague one) that can pass constitutional\nmuster. I know of no precedent for such “paring down,”3\n——————\n    3 The   only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is Civil Ser\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This is\nnot, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of\nadopting a “limiting construction” in the face of potential\nunconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care­\nful to note, the narrowing construction must be “fairly\npossible,” Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), “rea­\nsonable,” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),\nor not “plainly contrary to the intent of Congress,” Edward\nJ. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &\nConstr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we\nhave seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before\nMcNally concluded that the “deprivation of honest ser­\nvices” meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If\nit were a “fairly possible” or “reasonable” construction, not\n“contrary to the intent of Congress,” one would think that\nsome court would have adopted it. The Court does not\neven point to a post-McNally case that reads §1346 to\ncover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the\nCourt so heavily relies, see ante, at 41–42, states that\n“when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the\n——————\nvice Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in­\nvolved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of\nthe Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a\nvagueness challenge—not, however, by “paring down” the adjudications\nto a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what\nthey held was not vague. See id., at 571–574. The string of cases the\nCourt lists, see ante, at 41–42, n. 41, (almost none of which addressed\nclaims of vagueness), have nothing to do with “paring down.” The one\nthat comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.\n363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized\nby statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be\ncommenced and completed. That is not much different from “reading\nin” a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con­\ntracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or “paring down” of\nthe statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that\nthe proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370–371, and noted that\n(unlike here) it was not “decid[ing] issues of policy,” id., at 372.\n10               SKILLING v.

Attorney General v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United\nStates v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45 (1953) (describing the\ncanon as decisive “in the choice of fair alternatives”). Here\nthere is no choice to be made between two “fair alterna­\ntives.” Until today, no one has thought (and there is no\nbasis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib­\nited only bribery and kickbacks.\n   I certainly agree with the Court that we must, “if we\ncan,” uphold, rather than “condemn,” Congress’s enact­\nments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the\npower, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.\nCongress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest­\nservices law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)\nunclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the\ntemptation to make all things right with the stroke of our\npen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).\nI would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill­\ning’s conviction on the basis that §1346 provides no “ascer­\ntainable standard” for the conduct it condemns, L. Cohen,\n255 U. S., at 89. Instead, the Court today adds to our\nfunctions the prescription of criminal law.\n                              III\n   A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted\nsupra, at 2, Skilling has argued that §1346 cannot be\nconstitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi­\nnition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though\nthis reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling’s\nchallenge a “facial” one, in the sense that it seeks invalida­\ntion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to\npreventing its enforcement against him. I continue to\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See Chicago v.\nMorales, 527 U. S. 41, 77 (1999) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIn the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skill­\ning identifies in §1346 may mean that if he wins, anyone\nelse prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see\nSmith, supra, at 576–578. But Skilling only asks that his\nconviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57–58, so the\nremedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.\n  I would therefore reverse Skilling’s conviction under\n§1346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it\nprohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions—\nobvious from my reasoning in the case—would be a matter\nfor stare decisis.\n                        *    *     *\n  It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the\ndescription of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be\ndone, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness\nopinions, United States v. Reese, 92 U. S., at 221:\n       “The question, then, to be determined, is, whether\n    we can introduce words of limitation into a penal\n    statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it\n    is general only.\n         “It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature\n    could set a net large enough to catch all possible of­\n    fenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and\n    say who could be rightfully detained, and who should\n    be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute\n    the judicial for the legislative department of the gov­\n    ernment. . . .\n         “To limit this statute in the manner now asked\n    for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old\n    one.

I write separately to address peti\ntioner’s jury-trial argument.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants\na trial before “an impartial jury.” In my view, this re\nquirement is satisfied so long as no biased juror is actually\nseated at trial. Of course, evidence of pretrial media\nattention and widespread community hostility may play a\nrole in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important\nin assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu’Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 428–432 (1991), or in reviewing\nthe denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for\ncause, see, e.g., Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036–\n1040 (1984). There are occasions in which such evidence\nweighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end,\nhowever, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no\nviolation of the defendant’s right to an impartial jury. See\nid., at 1031–1035, 1041; Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,\n800–801, 803 (1975); see also Rivera v. Illinois, 556 U. S.\n___, ___–___ (2009) (slip op., at 7–8); United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 311, 316–317 (2000);\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 215–218 (1982).\n   Petitioner advances a very different understanding of\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe jury-trial right. Where there is extraordinary pretrial\npublicity and community hostility, he contends, a court\nmust presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of\nvenue. Brief for Petitioner 25–34. I disagree. Careful voir\ndire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even\nwhere pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile\ncommunity sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been\nselected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to\ninsulate jurors from media coverage during the course of\nthe trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is “an\nimpartial jury.” If the jury that sits and returns a verdict\nis impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth\nAmendment requires.\n   The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text\nof the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It re\nquires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse\npretrial media coverage and community hostility in a\nparticular case has reached a certain level of severity, but\nthere is no clear way of demarcating that level or of de\ntermining whether it has been met.\n   Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960’s—\nSheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S.\n723 (1963). I do not read those cases as demanding peti\ntioner’s suggested approach.          As the Court notes,\nSheppard and Estes primarily “involved media interfer\nence with courtroom proceedings during trial.” Ante, at\n16, n. 14; see also post, at 20 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Rideau involved unique\nevents in a small community.\n   I share some of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concerns about\nthe adequacy of the voir dire in this case and the trial\njudge’s findings that certain jurors could be impartial. See\npost, at 34–37. But those highly fact-specific issues are\nnot within the question presented. Pet. for Cert. i.

I respect­\nfully dissent, however, from the Court’s conclusion that\nJeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial\njury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the\npublic’s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a\ncourt must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the\njury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The\nsudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of\npeople in the Houston area and shocked the entire com­\nmunity. The accompanying barrage of local media cover­\nage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As\nEnron’s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the\nstorm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not\nconstitutionally compel a change of venue, they required\nthe District Court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which\nprospective jurors’ attitudes about the case were closely\nscrutinized. The District Court’s inquiry lacked the neces­\nsary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether\nthe jury empaneled to decide Skilling’s case was capable of\nrendering an impartial decision based solely on the evi­\ndence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would\n2                SKILLING v.

The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.\nVirtually overnight, what had been the city’s “largest,\nmost visible, and most prosperous company,” its “foremost\nsocial and charitable force,” and “a source of civic pride”\nwas reduced to a “shattered shell.” App. ¶¶11, 13, pp.\n649a–650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company’s employ­\nees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van­\nish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,\nthousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses\nshuttered, and community groups that once benefited from\nEnron’s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con­\ntributions. See, e.g., 3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also\n554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (“Accounting firms that\nserviced Enron’s books had less work, hotels had more\nopen rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on”).\nEnron’s community ties were so extensive that the entire\nlocal U. S. Attorney’s Office was forced to recuse itself\nfrom the Government’s investigation into the company’s\nfall. See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).\n   With Enron’s demise affecting the lives of so many\nHoustonians, local media coverage of the story saturated\nthe community. According to a defense media expert, the\nHouston Chronicle—the area’s leading newspaper—\nassigned as many as 12 reporters to work on the Enron\nstory full time. App. 568a–569a. The paper mentioned\nEnron in more than 4,000 articles during the 3-year period\nfollowing the company’s December 2001 bankruptcy filing.\nHundreds of these articles discussed Skilling by name.\nSee 3 Supp. Record 2114. Skilling’s expert, a professional\njournalist and academic with 30 years’ experience, could\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Local television news coverage\nwas similarly pervasive and, in terms of “editorial theme,”\n“largely followed the Chronicle’s lead.” Id., ¶11, at 559a;\nsee also id., at 717a. Between May 2002 and October\n2004, local stations aired an estimated 19,000 news seg­\nments involving Enron, more than 1600 of which men­\ntioned Skilling. 3 Supp. Record 2116.\n   While many of the stories were straightforward news\nitems, many others conveyed and amplified the commu­\nnity’s outrage at the top executives perceived to be respon­\nsible for the company’s bankruptcy. A Chronicle report on\nSkilling’s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the\ncoverage. It began, “Across Houston, Enron employees\nwatched former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling’s congres­\nsional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry\nand then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy\nand detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance\nabout critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed\nenergy giant.” App. 1218a. “ ‘He is lying; he knew every­\nthing,’ said [an employee], who said she had seen Skilling\nfrequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling\nwas known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at\nthe company. ‘I am getting sicker by the minute.’ ” Id., at\n1219a. A companion piece quoted a local attorney who\ncalled Skilling an “idiot” who was “in denial”; he added,\n“I’m glad [Skilling’s] not my client.” Id., at 592a–593a.\n   Articles deriding Enron’s senior executives were juxta­\nposed with pieces expressing sympathy toward and soli­\ndarity with the company’s many victims. Skilling’s media\nexpert counted nearly a hundred victim-related stories in\nthe Chronicle, including a “multi-page layout entitled ‘The\nFaces of Enron,’ ” which poignantly described the gut­\nwrenching experiences of former employees who lost vast\n4                   SKILLING v.

The conventional wisdom that blame for\nEnron’s devastating implosion and the ensuing human\ntragedy ultimately rested with Skilling and former Enron\nChairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the\npopular imagination that references to their involvement\neven turned up on the sports pages: “If you believe the\nstory about [Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do\nwith the end of Emmitt Smith’s Cowboys career, then you\nprobably believe in other far-fetched concepts. Like Jeff\nSkilling having nothing to do with Enron’s collapse.” 3\nSupp. Record 811.\n   When a federal grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and\nRichard Causey—Enron’s former chief accounting officer—\nin 2004 on charges of conspiracy to defraud, securities\nfraud, and other crimes, the media placed them directly in\nits crosshairs. In the words of one article, “there was one\nthing those whose lives were touched by the once-exalted\ncompany all seemed to agree upon: The indictment of\nformer Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was overdue.” App.\n1393a. Scoffing at Skilling’s attempts to paint himself as\n“a ‘victim’ of his subordinates,” id., at 1394a, the Chronicle\nderided “the doofus defense” that Lay and Skilling were\nexpected to offer, id., at 1401a.1 The Chronicle referred to\n——————\n    1 See\n        also App. 735a (describing Enron as “hardball fraud” and noting\nthat “Enron prosecutors have approached the case more like an organ­\nized crime investigation than a corporate fraud prosecution,” a “tactic\n[that] makes sense” given “the sheer pervasiveness of fraud, corruption,\nand self-dealing”); id., at 1403a (“Lay stood proudly in front of Enron’s\nfacade of success, while Skilling and his own prot[égé], [Andrew]\nFastow, ginned up increasingly convoluted mechanisms for concealing\nthe financial reality. . . .

During arraignment, news outlets “fol­\nlowed each man as he drove from his home to FBI headquarters, to the\ncourt, and back home, often providing ‘color’ commentary—such as\ninterviewing former Enron employees for comment on the day’s events.”\nId., ¶60, at 581a.\n  3 Reporting on the change-of-venue motion, the Chronicle described\n\nSkilling as a “desperate defendant,” and the Austin American-\nStatesman opined that while a change of venue may make sense “[f]rom\na legal perspective,” “from the standpoint of pure justice, the wealthy\nexecutives really should be judged right where their economic hurri­\ncane struck with the most force.” Id., at 748a, 747a.\n6                    SKILLING v.

Two-thirds of the jurors\n(about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the\ndefendants that suggested a potential predisposition to\nconvict. In many instances, they did not mince words,\ndescribing Skilling as “smug,” “arrogant,” “brash,” “con­\nceited,” “greedy,” “deceitful,” “totally unethical and crimi­\nnal,” “a crook,” “the biggest liar on the face of the earth,”\nand “guilty as sin” (capitalization omitted).4 Only about 5\npercent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read\nthe Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise “heard or read\nabout any of the Enron cases,” Record 13019, were not\nconnected to Enron victims, and gave no answers suggest­\n——————\n   4 See, e.g., Juror 1 (“Ken Lay and the others are guilty as all get out\n\nand ought to go to jail”; Skilling is “[b]rash, [a]rrogant [and]\n[c]onceited”; “I find it morally awful that these people are still running\nloose”); Juror 70 (“Mr. Skilling is the biggest liar on the face of the\nearth”); Juror 163 (Skilling “would lie to his mother if it would further\nhis cause”); Juror 185 (“I think [Skilling] was arrogant and a crook”);\nJuror 200 (Skilling is a “[s]killful [l]iar [and] crook” who did “a lot of the\ndirty work”; the defendants would “have to be blind, deaf, [and] stupid\nto be unaware of what was happening!” (emphasis deleted)); Juror 206\n(Skilling is “[t]otally unethical and criminal”; the defendants “are all\nguilty and should be reduced to having to beg on the corner [and] live\nunder a bridge”); Juror 238 (“They are all guilty as sin—come on now”);\nJuror 299 (Skilling “initiated, designed, [and] authorized certain illegal\nactions”); Juror 314 (Lay “should ‘fess up’ and take his punishment like\na man”; “[t]he same goes for Jeffrey Skilling. . . .

Skilling’s Renewed Venue Motion.\n8                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nplea wreaks havoc for Lay, Skilling.” Record 12049, n. 13;\nsee also ibid. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who de­\nscribed the plea as “a serious blow to the defense”). A\nChronicle editorial opined that “Causey’s admission of\nsecurities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay’s claim that\nmost of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial\npressure rather than actual wrongdoing.” Id., at 12391.\n   With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re­\nnewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the\nquestionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con­\nfirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In\nthe alternative, Skilling asserted that “defendants are\nentitled to a more thorough jury selection process than\ncurrently envisioned by the [c]ourt.” Id., at 12067. The\ncourt had announced its intention to question individual\njurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre­\nsent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,\ne.g., id., at 11804–11805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter\nalia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in\nquestioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri­\nvately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would\nbe easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,\nclients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070–12072; and\nthat the court “avoid leading questions,” which “tend to\n[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that\nmay not reflect their actual views,” id., at 12072. At a\nminimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a\ncontinuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques­\ntionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at\n12074–12075.\n   The District Court denied Skilling’s motion without a\nhearing, stating in a brief order that it was “not persuaded\nthat the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .\nestablish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju­\ndice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id.,\nat 14115. According to the court, the “jury questionnaires\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the\ncourt’s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide\nadequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the\nselection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.” Id., at\n14115–14116. The court did agree to delay the trial by\ntwo weeks, until January 30, 2006.\n  The coming trial featured prominently in local news\noutlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle\ndescribed “the hurt and anger and resentment” that had\nbeen “churn[ing] inside” Houstonians since Enron’s col­\nlapse. Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for\noffering a “doofus defense” (“a plea of not guilty by reason\nof empty-headedness”), the paper stated that “Lay and\nSkilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet\nnow fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.”\nIbid. The article allowed that the defendants’ guilt,\n“though perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an\nassertion. A jury now takes up the task of deciding\nwhether that assertion is valid.” Id., at 39947. The next\nparagraph, however, assured readers that “it’s normal for\nyour skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe­\neyed innocence that they were unaware that something\nwas amiss at Enron. The company’s utter failure belies\nthe claim.” Ibid. (one paragraph break omitted); see also\nid., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would “have\nto offer a convincing explanation for how executives once\ntouted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark\nabout the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their\nown company”).\n  It is against this backdrop of widespread community\nimpact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection\nin Skilling’s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective\njurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse lo­\ncated “about six blocks from Enron’s former headquar­\nters.” 554 F. 3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the\nDistrict Court began by briefly describing the case and\n10                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nproviding a standard admonition about the need to be fair\nand impartial and to decide the case based solely on the\ntrial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked\nwhether anyone had “any reservations about your ability\nto conscientiously and fairly follow these very important\nrules.” App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands\nand were called forward to the bench. One told the court\nthat he thought Lay and Skilling “knew exactly what they\nwere doing” and would have to prove their innocence. Id.,\nat 818a–819a. The second juror, who had stated on his\nwritten questionnaire that he held no opinion that would\npreclude him from being impartial, declared that he\n“would dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to\nclaim responsibility, at least 1⁄12 of the responsibility, for\nputting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their\nlives.” Id., at 819a–820a. The court excused both jurors\nfor cause.\n   The court proceeded to question individual jurors from\nthe bench. As the majority recounts, ante, at 7–8, the\ncourt asked them a few general yes/no questions about\ntheir exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of,\n“Do you recall any particular articles that stand out that\nyou’ve read about the case?” App. 850a. The court also\nasked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,\nfocusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly\npartial comments, the prospective jurors believed they\n“could be fair” and “put the government to its proof.” Id.,\nat 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues\nraised by the court. The court made clear, however, that\nits patience would be limited, see, e.g., id., at 879a, and\nquestioning tended to be brief—generally less than five\nminutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying\nbiases among several prospective jurors who had earlier\nexpressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.7\n——————\n 7 See   App. 894a (Juror 43) (expressed the view that the defendants\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Once it identified 38 qualified prospective jurors, the\ncourt allowed the defense and Government to exercise\ntheir allotted peremptory challenges. This left 12 jurors\nand 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for\nthe first time, “not [to] read anything dealing with the\ncase or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or\ntelevision or access any Internet sites that may deal with\nthe case” and to “inform your friends and family members\nthat they should not discuss with you anything they may\nhave read or heard about this case.” Id., at 1026a. Start\nto finish, the selection process took about five hours.\n  Skilling’s trial commenced the next day and lasted four\nmonths. After several days of deliberations, the jury\nfound Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities\nfraud, 5 counts of making false representations to audi­\ntors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 in­\nsider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all\ncounts.\n  On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his\nconstitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\nAddressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by\ndisavowing the District Court’s findings concerning “com­\nmunity hostility.” There was, the court concluded, “suffi­\ncient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding\nof presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense\nvolume of coverage.” 554 F. 3d, at 559. “[P]rejudice was\n[also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator’s well­\n\n——————\n“stole money” from their employees); id., at 922a (Juror 55) (admitted\nthat she “lean[ed] towards prejudging” the defendants); id., at 946a\n(Juror 71) (stated that she would place the burden of proof on the\ndefendants); id., at 954a–960a (Juror 75) (indicated that she could not\nset aside her view that there was fraud at Enron); id., at 1003a–1006a\n(Juror 104) (stated that she questioned the defendants’ innocence and\nthat she “would be very upset with the government if they could not\nprove their case”); id., at 1008a (Juror 112) (expressed that the view\nthat the defendants were guilty).\n12              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npublicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.”\nIbid. The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District\nCourt for failing to “consider the wider context.” Id., at\n560. “[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess\nthe tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the\nvolume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the\nreal inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele­\nvant sources.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, “[t]he district court\nseemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more\nthan just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer\nnumber of victims.” Ibid.\n  Having determined that “Skilling was entitled to a\npresumption of prejudice,” the Court of Appeals proceeded\nto explain that “the presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the\ngovernment may demonstrate from the voir dire that an\nimpartial jury was actually impanelled.” Id., at 561 (in­\nternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire\nas “exemplary,” “searching,” and “proper and thorough,”\nid., at 562, the court concluded that “[t]he government\n[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that\nconvicted Skilling was impartial,” id., at 564–565. On this\nbasis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling’s claim and\naffirmed his convictions.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and\nthe due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran­\ntee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside\npreconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and\ndecide guilt or innocence “based on the evidence presented\nin court.” Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see\nalso Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966).\nCommunity passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial\npublicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsome instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of\nthe community becomes so severe as to give rise to a “pre­\nsumption of [juror] prejudice.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S.\n1025, 1031 (1984).\n   The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre­\nsumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:\nOnce the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com­\nmunity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to\nprove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly\nenvisions a fixed point at which public passions become so\nintense that prejudice to a defendant’s fair-trial rights\nmust be presumed. The majority declines, however, to\ndecide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the\nCourt of Appeals held.\n   This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive\nprejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely\nconvey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of\npublic enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju­\ndices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The under­\nlying question has always been this: Do we have confi­\ndence that the jury’s verdict was “induced only by evidence\nand argument in open court, and not by any outside influ­\nence, whether of private talk or public print”? Patterson v.\nColorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,\n462 (1907).\n   The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a\njury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the\nintensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial\npublicity and community animus.           Reviewing courts,\nmeanwhile, must assess whether the trial court’s proce­\ndures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury\nfree from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421\nU. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for “any\nindications in the totality of circumstances that peti­\ntioner’s trial was not fundamentally fair”). This Court’s\nprecedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different\n14              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsituations to safeguard a defendant’s constitutional right\nto a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n   At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare\noccasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circum­\nstances that it has reversed a defendant’s conviction\n“without pausing to examine . . . the voir dire examination\nof the members of the jury.” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373\nU. S. 723, 727 (1963). In Rideau, repeated television\nbroadcasts of the defendant’s confession to murder, rob­\nbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local senti­\nment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir\ndire could have secured an impartial jury. A change of\nvenue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to\nassure a fair trial. Ibid.; see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §23.2(a), p. 264\n(3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (“The best reading of\nRideau is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial\npublicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that\nthe voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the\nlikely prejudice among prospective jurors”).\n   As the majority describes, ante, at 14, this Court\nreached similar conclusions in Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S.\n532 (1965), and Sheppard, 384 U. S. 333. These cases\ninvolved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media\ndisruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argu­\nment that the defendants were not entitled to relief from\ntheir convictions because they “ha[d] established no isola­\ntable prejudice,” the Court described the “untoward cir­\ncumstances” as “inherently suspect.” Estes, 381 U. S., at\n542, 544. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to\nhave been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the “bed­\nlam” that surrounded them. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355.\nCriticizing the trial courts’ failures “to protect the jury\nfrom outside influence,” id., at 358, the Court stressed\nthat, “where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudi­\ncial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nshould continue the case until the threat abates, or trans­\nfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.”\nId., at 363. Estes and Sheppard thus applied Rideau’s\ninsight that in particularly extreme circumstances even\nthe most rigorous voir dire cannot suffice to dispel the\nreasonable likelihood of jury bias.\n   Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has\ndeclined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead\nexamined the particulars of the jury selection process to\ndetermine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted\nby pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court\nhas recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant\npervades the community there is a high risk that biased\njurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is\nnot merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately\nhide their prejudices, but also that, as “part of a commu­\nnity deeply hostile to the accused,” “they may unwittingly\n[be] influenced” by the fervor that surrounds them. Mur\nphy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in such\nadverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully con­\nsider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors\nand then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assur­\nances of fairness. Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719,\n729 (1992) (“[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant’s right\nto an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify\nunqualified jurors”).\n   Irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial\ncourt’s voir dire did not suffice to counter the “wave of\npublic passion” that had swept the community prior to the\ndefendant’s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news media\nhad “extensively covered” the crimes (a murder spree),\n“arous[ing] great excitement and indignation.” Id., at 719\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin’s\narrest, the press “blanketed” the community with “a bar­\nrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pic­\ntures” communicating numerous unfavorable details about\n16               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nIrvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. Id., at\n725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors ex­\namined during the trial court’s voir dire “entertained some\nopinion as to guilt—ranging in intensity from mere suspi­\ncion to absolute certainty.” Id., at 727. Of the 12 jurors\nseated, 8 “thought petitioner was guilty,” although “each\nindicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could ren­\nder an impartial verdict.” Id., at 727, 724.\n    Despite the seated jurors’ assurances of impartiality,\nthis Court invalidated Irvin’s conviction for want of due\nprocess. “It is not required,” this Court declared, “that the\njurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\n. . . It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression\nor opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence\npresented in court.” Id., at 722–723. The Court empha­\nsized, however, that a juror’s word on this matter is not\ndecisive, particularly when “the build-up of prejudice [in\nthe community] is clear and convincing.” Id., at 725.\nMany of Irvin’s jurors, the Court noted, had been influ­\nenced by “the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown\nto be present throughout the community.” Id., at 727\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not\n“doubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he\nwould be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so\nmany, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a state­\nment of impartiality can be given little weight.” Id., at\n728.\n    The media coverage and community animosity in Irvin\nwas particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this\nCourt recognized that high-profile cases may generate\nsubstantial publicity without stirring similar public pas­\nsions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court\nclarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case\nsuch as Irvin. So long as the trial court conducts a rea­\nsonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the abil­\nity of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     17\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\na verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would\ngenerally have no reason to doubt the jury’s impartiality.8\n  The first of these cases, Murphy, 421 U. S. 794, involved\na well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi­\ncized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied\nhis motion for a change of venue and during voir dire\nexcused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin­\nguishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir\ndire of “such hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who\nserved in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not\nbe laid aside.” 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors\n“had a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur­\nphy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]\npast crimes,” “none betrayed any belief in the relevance of\n[Murphy’s] past to the present case.” Ibid.; see also ibid.,\nn. 4 (contrasting a juror’s “mere familiarity with [a defen­\ndant] or his past” with “an actual predisposition against\nhim”). “[T]hese indicia of impartiality,” the Court sug­\ngested, “might be disregarded in a case where the general\natmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently\ninflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur­\nphy’s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.” Id., at 802.\n  In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant\nwas granted a new trial four years after being convicted of\nmurder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial\npublicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had\npreviously been convicted and had made confessions that\nwould be inadmissible in court. The state trial court\ndenied Yount’s motion and seated a jury following a 10­\nday voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the\n——————\n  8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court\n\nviolates a defendant’s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies\na for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on\nthe jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,\n316 (2000) (“[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed\nfor cause . . . would require reversal”).\n18               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nprospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent\n“admitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.”\nId., at 1029. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas\nreview, this Court stressed the significant interval be­\ntween Yount’s first trial—when “adverse publicity and the\ncommunity’s sense of outrage were at their height”—and\nhis second trial, which “did not occur until four years later,\nat a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly dimin­\nished and community sentiment had softened.” Id., at\n1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had\n“at some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount’s guilt,”\nthe “particularly extensive” voir dire confirmed that “time\nhad weakened or eliminated any” bias they once may have\nharbored. Id., at 1029–1030, 1034, n. 10, 1033. Accord­\ningly, this Court concluded, “the trial court did not commit\nmanifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was\nimpartial.” Id., at 1032.\n   This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of\npretrial publicity in Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415\n(1991). Mu’Min stood accused of murdering a woman\nwhile out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper\narticles about the crime, Mu’Min moved for a change of\nvenue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and at­\ntempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of\nthe 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard\nabout the case from media or other sources. Dividing\nthese prospective jurors into panels of four, the court\nasked further general questions about their ability to be\nfair given what they had heard or read. One juror an­\nswered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The\ncourt refused Mu’Min’s request to ask more specific ques­\ntions “relating to the content of news items that potential\njurors might have read or seen.” Id., at 419. Of the 12\npersons who served on the jury, “8 had at one time or\nanother read or heard something about the case. None\nhad indicated that he had formed an opinion about the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncase or would be biased in any way.” Id., at 421.\n   Rejecting Mu’Min’s attempt to analogize his case to\nIrvin, this Court observed that “the cases differ both in the\nkind of community in which the coverage took place and in\nextent of media coverage.” 500 U. S., at 429. Mu’Min’s\noffense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,\narea, “which has a population of over 3 million, and in\nwhich, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed\neach year.” Ibid. While the crime garnered “substantial”\npretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in\nIrvin and “did not contain the same sort of damaging\ninformation.” 500 U. S., at 429–430. Moreover, in con­\ntrast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed\nhaving ever formed an opinion about the case. Given\nthese circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu’Min’s asser­\ntion that the trial court committed constitutional error by\ndeclining to “make precise inquiries about the contents of\nany news reports that potential jurors have read.” 500\nU. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling\nwas context-specific: “Had the trial court in this case been\nconfronted with the ‘wave of public passion’ engendered by\npretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin’s\ntrial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend­\nment might well have required more extensive examina­\ntion of potential jurors than it undertook here.” Id., at\n429.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to determine how this case compares to\nour existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances\nso inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most\nscrupulous voir dire would have been “but a hollow formal­\nity” incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373\nU. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac­\nter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process\nsufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and\n20              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncommunity animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable\nof presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial\ninfluences?\n                              A\n   Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that\nthe prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was\nnot so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District\nCourt acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling’s mo­\ntion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this\nconclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the\nsize and diversity of the Houston community make it\nprobable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number\nof persons who were unaffected by Enron’s collapse, neu­\ntral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the\npublic furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while\nubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court\npoints out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or\nsimilar “smoking-gun” evidence of specific criminal acts.\nFor many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen­\ndant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the\npleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt\nsuggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds\nexposed to such information would not necessarily have\nformed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was\nguilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major­\nity of the county’s residents were “exposed repeatedly and\nin depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing\nin detail to the crimes with which he was later to be\ncharged”). Third, there is no suggestion that the court­\nroom in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a\n“carnival” in which the “calmness and solemnity” of the\nproceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at\n358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted).

While the procedures employed by the Dis­\ntrict Court might have been adequate in the typical high­\nprofile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary\ncircumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling’s constitu­\ntional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n\n——————\n  9 Whether   the District Court abused its discretion in declining to\nchange venue pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a\ndifferent question. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 21(a) (“Upon the defen­\ndant’s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that\ndefendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a\nprejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that\nthe defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there”). As this\nCourt has indicated, its supervisory powers confer “more latitude” to set\nstandards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.\nMu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 424 (1991). While the circumstances\nmay not constitutionally compel a change of venue “without pausing to\nexamine . . . the voir dire,” Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723, 727\n(1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the\ncommunity’s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that\nthe task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major chal­\nlenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far\neasier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story\nhad less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that “[i]t\nwould not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have\ngranted Skilling’s transfer motion.” 554 F. 3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009).\nSkilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers\nclaim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth\nCircuit, see id., at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. ante, at\n12, n. 11.\n22               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the “wide\ndiscretion” owed to trial courts when it comes to jury­\nrelated issues. Mu’Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20–\n21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public\nsentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox­\nimity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons\nin the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.\n“[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an\nindependent evaluation of the circumstances.” Sheppard,\n384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well\nqualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented\nprocedures adequate to keep community prejudices from\ninfecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not\nbefit the circumstances of the case, the trial court’s rulings\non impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See\nMorgan, 504 U. S., at 729–730 (“ ‘Without an adequate\nvoir dire the trial judge’s responsibility to remove prospec­\ntive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the\ncourt’s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be\nfulfilled’ ” (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451\nU. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also\nMu’Min, 500 U. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Our\nwillingness to accord substantial deference to a trial\ncourt’s finding of juror impartiality rests on our expecta­\ntion that the trial court will conduct a sufficient voir dire\nto determine the credibility of a juror professing to be\nimpartial”).\n                             1\n   As the Court of Appeals apprehended, the District Court\ngave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public\nhostility. For Houstonians, Enron’s collapse was an event\nof once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the\nvolume of media coverage “immense” and frequently in­\ntemperate, but “the sheer number of victims” created a\nclimate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

The pre­\ntrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news\nreports, most of which were “largely factual in nature.”\nMurphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no indication that\nthe relevant communities had been captivated by the\ncases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In\ncontrast, the number of media reports in this case reached\nthe tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of\nSkilling were common. The much closer analogy is thus to\nIrvin, which similarly featured a “barrage” of media cover­\nage and a “huge . . . wave of public passion,” 366 U. S., at\n725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve\ndirect harm to entire segments of the community.10\n   Attempting to distinguish Irvin, the majority suggests\nthat Skilling’s economic offenses were less incendiary than\nIrvin’s violent crime spree and that “news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor­\nmation rife in reports about Irvin’s rampage of robberies\nand murders.” Ante, at 28. Along similar lines, the Dis­\ntrict Court described “the facts of this case [as] neither\nheinous nor sensational.” App. to Brief for United States\n10a. The majority also points to the four years that\npassed between Enron’s declaration of bankruptcy and the\nstart of Skilling’s trial, asserting that “the decibel level of\nmedia attention diminished somewhat” over this time.\nAnte, at 17. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n   First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread\ncommunity outrage more readily than crimes involving\nmonetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of\n——————\n 10 One of Skilling’s experts noted that, “[i]n cases involving 200 or\n\nmore articles, trial judges granted a change of venue 59% of the time.”\nApp. ¶30, p. 611a.\n24                    SKILLING v.

Indeed, the record in this case is\nreplete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling\nand other Enron executives. See, e.g., Record 39946\n(front-page, eve-of-trial story describing “the hurt and\nanger and resentment . . . churn[ing] inside” the people of\nHouston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other\nthings, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terror­\nist.11 As one commentator observed, “[i]t’s a sign of how\nshocked Houstonians are about Enron’s ignominious\ndemise that Sept. 11 can be invoked—and is frequently—\nto explain the shock of the company’s collapse.” 3 Supp.\nRecord 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and\nother top executives hired private security to protect\nthemselves from persons inclined to take the law into their\nown hands. See, e.g., App. 1154a (“After taking the tem­\nperature of Enron’s victims, [a local lawyer] says the\nEnron executives are wise to take security precautions”).\n   Second, the passage of time did little to soften commu­\nnity sentiment. Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, ante,\nat 17, this case in no way resembles Yount, where, by the\ntime of the defendant’s retrial, “prejudicial publicity [had]\ngreatly diminished” and community animus had signifi­\n——————\n   11 See, e.g., 554 F. 3d, at 559, n. 42 (“I’m livid, absolutely livid . . . .

(in the\nmonths preceding the defendant’s retrial, newspaper\nreports about the case averaged “less than one article per\nmonth,” and public interest was “minimal”). The Enron\nstory was a continuing saga, and “publicity remained\nintense throughout.” 554 F. 3d, at 560. Not only did\nEnron’s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but\nso too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related\nevents.12 Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty\nplea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling’s\ntrial. If anything, the time that elapsed between the\nbankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an\nunbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members\nof the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related\nguilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their\ncertainty that Skilling too had engaged in—if not master­\nminded—criminal acts, particularly given that the media\n——————\n  12 Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress,\n\nand other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights;\nEnron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and\nsentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force\ncharged Enron CFO and Skilling-protégé Andrew Fastow with fraud,\nmoney laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees\npleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task\nForce indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr.\n(the company’s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant\ntreasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband\nServices; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received\nprison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.\nIn 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and\nCausey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding\nLay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered\nguilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers\nwere defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal\ninvolving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held\nin Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various\npretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay,\nand Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey\npleaded guilty to securities fraud.\n26                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncoverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7–8. The trial\nof Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had\ncome before. See Record 40002 (noting that “prosecutors\nfollowed the classic pattern of working their way up\nthrough the ranks”). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,\nshortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services\nexecutives ended without convictions, “The real trial, the\ntrue measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu­\nary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We’ve got\nbigger fish in need of frying.” App. 1460a (paragraph\nbreaks omitted); see also ibid. (“From the beginning, the\nEnron prosecution has had one true measure of success:\nLay and Skilling in a cold steel cage”).\n   Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston\ncommunity remained overwhelmingly negative was dis­\npelled by prospective jurors’ responses to the written\nquestionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5–7,\nmore than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew\nvictims of Enron’s collapse or were victims themselves,\nand two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen­\ndant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling\nwas palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of\nthe prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re­\nsponses. And this was before Causey’s guilty plea and the\nflurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of\ntrial. One of Skilling’s experts, a political scientist who\nhad studied pretrial publicity “for over 35 years” and\nconsulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he\nhad recommended against venue changes more often than\nnot), “c[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of\nbias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at\nleast one of the very highest I have ever encountered.”\nApp. ¶¶2, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).\n                              2\n     Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n362. As this Court has recognized, “[i]n a community\nwhere most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying preju­\ndice, the reliability of the others’ protestations may be\ndrawn into question.” Murphy, 421 U. S., at 803; see also\nGroppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 510 (1971) (“ ‘[A]ny\njudge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms\nthey are extremely likely to be impregnated by the envi­\nroning atmosphere’ ” (quoting Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.\n309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps be­\ncause it had underestimated the public’s antipathy toward\nSkilling, the District Court’s 5-hour voir dire was mani­\nfestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.13\n  As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not\n——————\n  13 The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the\n\nthree previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were simi­\nlarly brief. See ante, at 23. The circumstances of those cases, however,\nwere very different. In particular, the defendants had not been person­\nally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism\nthat had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, e.g.,\nsupra, at 25–26, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely\nseen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclu­\nsion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice\nto select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the\nprocesses used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.\n  Moreover, in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case, I do\nnot mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the\nadequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one,\nshould be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always\ntake care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a\ndefendant’s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court­\nled versus attorney-led voir dire. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,\nand I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial\njury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the\nscope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.\n28                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npursued at all. The majority accepts, for instance, that\n“publicity about a codefendant’s guilty plea calls for in­\nquiry to guard against actual prejudice.” Ante, at 19.\nImplying that the District Court undertook this inquiry,\nthe majority states that “[o]nly two venire members re­\ncalled [Causey’s] plea.” Ibid. In fact, the court asked very\nfew prospective jurors any questions directed to their\nknowledge of or feelings about that event.14 Considering\nhow much news the plea generated, many more than two\nvenire members were likely aware of it. The lack of ques­\ntioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea\non those jurors impossible to assess.\n   The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to de­\nscribe personal interactions they may have had about the\ncase, or to consider whether they might have difficulty\navoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or\ncolleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The\ntidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects\nprovided cause for concern. In response to general media­\nrelated questions, several prospective jurors volunteered\nthat they had spoken with others about the case. Juror\n74, for example, indicated that her husband was the “news\nperson,” that they had “talked about it,” that she had also\nheard things “from work,” and that what she heard was\n“all negative, of course.” App. 948a. The court, however,\ndid not seek elaboration about the substance of these\ninteractions. Surely many prospective jurors had similar\n\n——————\n  14 Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court’s\n\nquestion about whether he “recall[ed] listening to any particular\nprograms about the case.” App. 888a. Juror 96, meanwhile, told the\ncourt that he read the “whole” Houston Chronicle every day, including\n“all the articles about Enron.” Id., at 992a. The court, however, did not\nask any questions designed to elicit information about the Causey plea.\nInstead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling’s counsel\nmanaged to squeeze in a follow-up as to whether he had “read about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two.” Id., at 993a.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Yet this too was a subject\nthe District Court did not adequately explore. On the few\noccasions when prospective jurors were asked whether\nthey would feel pressure from the public to convict, they\nacknowledged that it might be difficult to return home\nafter delivering a not-guilty verdict. Juror 75, for in­\nstance, told the court, “I think a lot of people feel that\nthey’re guilty. And maybe they’re expecting something to\ncome out of this trial.” Id., at 956a. It would be “tough,”\nshe recognized, “to vote not guilty and go back into the\ncommunity.” Id., at 957a; see also id., at 852a (Juror 10)\n(admitting “some hesitancy” about “telling people the\ngovernment didn’t prove its case”).\n  With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the\nDistrict Court’s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly\ntroubling.15 Although Juror 101 responded in the negative\nwhen asked whether she had “read anything in the news­\npaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,” she volunteered that\nshe “just heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling\nand Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and\nthat there was an insurance policy that they could collect\non, also.” Id., at 998a. This information, she explained,\n“was just something I overheard today—other jurors\ntalking.” Ibid. It seemed suspicious, she intimated, “to\nhave an insurance policy ahead of time.” Id., at 999a. The\ncourt advised her that “most corporations provide insur­\nance for their officers and directors.” Ibid. The court,\nhowever, did not investigate the matter further, even\n——————\n  15 Portions of the voir dire transcript erroneously refer to this pro­\n\nspective juror as “Juror 110.” See, e.g., id., at 996a.\n30                 SKILLING v.

It is thus\nnot apparent whether other prospective jurors also over­\nheard the information and whether they too believed that\nit reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar­\nent what other outside information may have been shared\namong the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101’s\nstatements indicate that the court’s questions were failing\nto bring to light the extent of jurors’ exposure to poten­\ntially prejudicial facts and that some prospec-\ntive jurors were having difficulty following the court’s\ndirectives.\n   The topics that the District Court did cover were ad­\ndressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were\nasked just a few yes/no questions about their general\nexposure to media coverage and a handful of additional\nquestions concerning any responses to the written ques­\ntionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their\nanswers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely\nsought to draw them out with open-ended questions about\ntheir impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited\npatience for counsel’s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at\n\n\n——————\n  16 Thecourt’s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:\n  “Q.

See\nid., at 863a (“[H]e said he thought that he would find them\nguilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said\nthat it would be worse than a German trying to say that\nthey didn’t kill the Jews”).19 Other jurors may well have\nencountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary\nrhetoric.\n  These deficiencies in the form and content of the voir\n——————\n  17 The  majority’s criticism of Skilling’s counsel for failing to ask ques­\ntions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. ante, at 23–24, is thus\nmisplaced. Given the District Court’s express warning early in the voir\ndire that it would not allow counsel “to ask individual questions if\n[they] abuse[d]” that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for\ndeclining to test the court’s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the\ncourt’s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave\ncounsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.\n   18 Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the com­\n\nmunity hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial\npublicity, acknowledging that “all of us have been exposed to substan­\ntial media attention about this case.” Id., at 841a. The court even\nmade an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions,\n“the Nigerian barge case,” apparently expecting that the prospective\njurors would understand the reference. Id., at 840a.\n   19 Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective ju­\n\nrors, Juror 17 stated that he “thought the guy [on the radio] was pretty\nnarrow minded,” that “everyone should be considered innocent totally\nuntil they get a chance to come [to] court,” and that the Government\nmight have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions.\nId., at 863a–864a. He added, however, that he “believe[d] there was\nprobably some accounting fraud [at Enron].” Id., at 864a. The District\nCourt denied the Government’s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,\nbut he did not ultimately sit on the jury.\n32                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ndire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis­\ntrict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment\nof prospective jurors’ assurances of impartiality. Although\nthe Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran­\nscript indicates that the District Court essentially took\njurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In­\ndeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec­\ntive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar­\ntiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.\nJuror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that\nSkilling was “not an honest man.” App. 881a. During\nquestioning, she acknowledged having previously thought\nthe defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost\n$50,000–$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron’s col­\nlapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that\nshe would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,\n884a. Noting that she “blame[d] Enron for the loss of her\nmoney” and appeared to have “unshakeable bias,” Skill­\ning’s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The\ncourt, however, declined to remove her, stating that “she\nanswered candidly she’s going to have an open mind now”\nand “agree[ing]” with the Government’s assertion that “we\nhave to take her at her word.” Id., at 885a–886a.20 As\n——————\n  20 The  majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by\nnoting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a\nperemptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 32. The\nmajority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members\nwho were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments\nof these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar­\ntiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly “part of a community\ndeeply hostile to the accused” and who may have been “unwittingly\ninfluenced by it.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also\nIrvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the\nDistrict Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror\n29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it\nthrough to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi­\ndence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    33\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthis Court has made plain, jurors’ assurances of impartial­\nity simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic signifi­\ncance. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (“[T]he juror’s\nassurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi­\ntive of the accused’s rights”); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728\n(“Where so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a\nstatement of impartiality can be given little weight”).\n   Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions\naccepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal\non their face. Prospective jurors who “hope[d]” they could\npresume innocence and did “not necessarily” think Skill­\ning was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.\n932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her\nquestionnaire, “Shame on him.” Id., at 931a. Asked by\nthe court about this, she stated that, “innocent or guilty,\nhe was at the helm” and “should have known what was\ngoing on at the company.” Ibid.; see also id., at 934a\n(Skilling is “probably” “in the same boat as” Lay). The\ncourt then asked, “can you presume, as you start this trial,\nthat Mr. Lay is innocent?” Id., at 932a. She responded, “I\nhope so, but you know. I don’t know. I can’t honestly\nanswer that one way or the other.” Ibid.; see also id., at\n933a (“I bring in my past history. I bring in my biases. I\nwould like to think I could rise above those, but I’ve never\nbeen in this situation before. So I don’t know how I could\nhonestly answer that question one way or the other. . . . I\ndo have some concerns”). Eventually, however, Juror 61\nanswered “Yes” when the court asked if she would be able\nto acquit if she had “a reasonable doubt that the defen­\ndants are guilty.” Id., at 933a–934a. Challenging her for\ncause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received\n“a clear and unequivocal answer” about her ability to be\n—————— \n\nlittle is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave §23.2(f), at 288 (“The\n\nresponses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated\n\njurors who were familiar with the same publicity”). \n\n34                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nfair. Ibid. The court denied the challenge, stating, “You\nknow, she tried.” Ibid.\n                               3\n  The majority takes solace in the fact that most of the\npersons actually seated as jurors and alternates “specifi­\ncally stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron­\nrelated news.” Ante, at 24–25, and n. 26.21 In context,\nhowever, these general declarations reveal little about the\nseated jurors’ actual knowledge or views or the possible\npressure they might have felt to convict, and thus cannot\ninstill confidence that the jurors “were not under [the]\nsway” of the prevailing community sentiment. Cf. ante, at\n25. Jurors who did not “get into details” of Enron’s com­\nplicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless\nknew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that\nSkilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.\nJuror 63, for instance, told the court that she “may have\nheard a little bit” about Enron-related litigation but had\nnot “really pa[id] attention.” Id., at 935a. Yet she was\nclearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire,\ndespite stating that she had not followed Enron-related\nnews, she wrote about “whistleblowers and Arthur Ander­\nsen lying about Enron’s accounting,” and she expressed\nthe view that Skilling and Lay “probably knew they were\nbreaking the law.” Supp. App. 105sa–106sa. During\nquestioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District\nCourt obtained no meaningful information about the\nactual extent of Juror 63’s familiarity with the case or the\nbasis for her belief in Skilling’s guilt. Yet it nevertheless\n——————\n  21 The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors\n\nand alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection. Ante, at\n24, and n. 25. This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and\nalternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost\njobs or money as a result of Enron’s collapse—a fact that does not strike\nme as particularly reassuring.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

App. 937a.22\n   Indeed, the District Court’s anemic questioning did little\nto dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numer­\nous other seated jurors and alternates. In my estimation,\nmore than half of those seated made written and oral\ncomments suggesting active antipathy toward the defen­\ndants. The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts\nthat “Skilling’s seated jurors . . . exhibited nothing like the\ndisplay of bias shown in Irvin.” Ante, at 29. Juror 10, for\ninstance, reported on his written questionnaire that he\nknew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he\npersonally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual\nfund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from\nthe “Houston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels,\nFox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]\nTexas Lawyer Magazine”; that he believed Enron’s col­\nlapse “was due to greed and mismanagement”; that “[i]f\n[Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he\nwas really a poor manager/leader”; and that the defen­\ndants were “suspect.” Supp. App. 11sa–19sa. During\nquestioning, he said he “th[ought]” he could presume\ninnocence and “believe[d]” he could put the Government to\nits proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have\n“some hesitancy” “in telling people the government didn’t\nprove its case.” App. 851a–852a.\n——————\n  22 As one of Skilling’s jury experts observed, there is a “tendency in\nvoir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their\nexposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any\nbiases they may have.” App. 763a; see also id., at 637a (“Those who\nperceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluc­\ntant to admit they cannot be fair”). For this reason, the fact that “none\nof the seated jurors and alternates checked the ‘yes’ box” on the written\nquestionnaire when “asked whether they ‘ha[d] an opinion about\n[Skilling],’ ” ante, at 26, is of minimal significance, particularly given\nthat the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant\nmedia coverage after the questionnaires were submitted.\n36                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Juror 11 wrote that he “work[ed] with someone who\nworked at Enron”; that he got Enron-related news from\nthe “Houston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13\nNews, O’Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co­\nworkers”; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site;\nthat “greed on Enron’s part” caused the company’s col­\nlapse; and that “a lot of people were hurt financially.”\nSupp. App. 26sa–30sa. During questioning, he stated that\nhe would have “no problem” requiring the Government to\nprove its case, but he also told the court that he believed\nLay was “greedy” and that corporate executives are often\n“stretching the legal limits . . . . I’m not going to say that\nthey’re all crooks, but, you know.” App. 857a, 854a.\nAsked whether he would “star[t] the case with sort of an\ninkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done\nsomething illegal,” he offered an indeterminate “not neces­\nsarily.” Id., at 857.23\n——————\n  23 Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly trou­\n\nbling sentiments. See, e.g., Supp. App. 57sa–60sa (Juror 20) (obtained\nEnron-related news from the Chronicle and “local news stations”;\nblamed Enron’s collapse on “[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective\naudit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets”; and\nwas “angry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement\nsavings”); id., at 72sa–75sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news\nfrom various sources, including the Chronicle; was “angry about what\nhappened”; and “fe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and invested in\nthe corp[oration] only to have it all taken away”); id., at 117sa–118sa\n(Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money;\nheard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as\n“sad” because “people lost jobs [and] money—lots of money”; and\nbelieved the Government “did the right thing” in its investigation); id.,\nat 177sa–181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the\nChronicle, Channel 13 news, the O’Reilly Factor, Internet news sources,\nand friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron’s collapse to\n“[p]oor management [and] bad judgment—greed”; lamented “[t]he sad\nstate of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their\nretirement accounts”; and “admire[d] [the] bravery” of Enron whistle­\nblower Sherron Watkins “for bringing the situation to the attention of\nthe public, which stopped things from getting worse”); id., at 191sa–\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Juror 13, for\ninstance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard\nabout the Enron cases from the “[n]ews.” Supp. App. 42sa.\nThe court questioned him for two minutes, during which\ntime he confirmed that he had “heard what’s on the news,\nbasically,” including “that the trial had moved from the\n17th to the 31st.” He added that the story “was all over\nthe news on every detail of Enron.” App. 858a–860a. No\nmeaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes\nwas obtained. Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not\nfollowed Enron-related news but was aware that “[m]any\npeople lost their jobs.” Supp. App. 151sa. The court ques­\ntioned her for less than 90 seconds. During that time, she\nacknowledged that she had “caught glimpses” of the cov­\nerage and “kn[e]w generally, you know, that the company\nwent bankrupt” and that there “were some employees that\nwent off and did their own businesses.” App. 969a. Little\nmore was learned.24\n——————\n195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news from his wife, co-workers,\nand television; wrote that “[i]t’s not right for someone . . . to take” away\nthe money that the “small average worker saves . . . for retirement all\nhis life”; and described the Government’s Enron investigation as “a\ngood thing”); id., at 221sa–225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information\nabout Enron from a “co-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs.\nFastow’s trial”; worked for an employer who lost money as a result of\nEnron’s collapse; found it “sad” that the collapse had affected “such a\nhuge number of people”; and thought “someone had to be doing some­\nthing illegal”); id., at 236sa–237sa (Juror 116) (knew a colleague who\nlost money in Enron’s collapse; obtained Enron-related news from the\n“Houston Chronicle, Time Magazine, local TV news [and] radio, friends,\nfamily, [and] co-workers, [and] internet news sources”; and noted\nthat what stood out was “[t]he employees and retirees that lost their\nsavings”).\n  24 Several other jurors fell into this category. Juror 67 wrote on his\n38                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In assessing the likelihood that bias lurked in the minds\nof at least some of these seated jurors, I find telling the\nway in which voir dire played out. When the District\nCourt asked the prospective jurors as a group whether\nthey had any reservations about their ability to presume\ninnocence and put the Government to its proof, only two\nanswered in the affirmative, and both were excused for\ncause. Id., at 815a–820a. The District Court’s individual\nquestioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying\nprejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors\nwho had earlier expressed no concerns about their impar­\ntiality. See n. 7, supra. It thus strikes me as highly likely\nthat at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that\nthey could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more\nprobing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. Yount,\n467 U. S., at 1034, n. 10 (holding that the trial court’s\n“particularly extensive” 10-day voir dire assured the jury’s\nimpartiality).25\n——————\nquestionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle and\n“Internet news sources.” Id., at 133sa. He was questioned for 90\nseconds, during which time he indicated that he had read an article on\nthe Internet the preceding night “about the jury selection taking place\ntoday, stuff like that.” App. 944a. Juror 99 wrote that she had not\nheard or read about the Enron cases and did not “know anything about”\nEnron. Supp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely\none minute. She stated that she had “[n]ot really” learned more about\nthe case, but added that she had heard “this and that” from her par­\nents. App. 995a–996a. The court did not press further.\n  25 The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling “challenged only\n\none of the seated jurors for cause” indicates that he did not believe the\nother jurors were biased. Ante, at 31. Our decisions, however, distin­\nguish claims involving “the partiality of an individual juror” from\nantecedent claims directed at “the partiality of the trial jury as a\nwhole.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036 (1984); see also Frazier v.\nUnited States, 335 U. S. 497, 514 (1948) (“[T]he two sorts of challenge[s]\nare distinct and are therefore to be dealt with separately”). If the jury\nselection process does not, as here, give a defendant a fair opportunity\nto identify biased jurors, the defendant can hardly be faulted for failing\nto make for-cause challenges.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           39\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  The majority suggests, ante, at 17–18, 30, that the jury’s\ndecision to acquit Skilling on nine relatively minor insider\ntrading charges confirms its impartiality. This argument,\nhowever, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vin­\ndictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely\nbelieve in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor\ndisqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit\nwhere evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously\nresolving closer calls against the defendant rather than\ngiving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf. United States v.\nMcVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (preju­\ndice “may go unrecognized in those who are affected by it.\nThe prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a\nbias or discriminatory attitude. It includes an impairment\nof the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from\nevidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to some­\nthing not included in the evidence. That something has its\nmost powerful effect if it generates strong emotional re­\nsponses”). In this regard, it is significant that the Gov­\nernment placed relatively little emphasis on the nine\ninsider trading counts during its closing argument, declin­\ning to explain its theory on all but one of the counts in any\ndetail whatsoever. Record 37010. The acquittals on those\ncounts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of\nprejudice.\n                        *     *     *\n  In sum, I cannot accept the majority’s conclusion that\nvoir dire gave the District Court “a sturdy foundation to\nassess fitness for jury service.” Cf. ante, at 29. Taken\ntogether, the District Court’s failure to cover certain vital\nsubjects, its superficial coverage of other topics, and its\nuncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave\nme doubtful that Skilling’s jury was indeed free from the\ndeep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at\nlarge. “[R]egardless of the heinousness of the crime\n40              SKILLING v.
