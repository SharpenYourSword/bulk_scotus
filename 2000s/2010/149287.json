PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09–158.      Argued March 24, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder. After the Ala\n  bama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction pro\n  ceedings, he sought federal habeas relief. The District Court condi\n  tionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be\n  released or resentenced. The state trial court sentenced him to death\n  a second time. He filed another federal habeas application, challeng\n  ing this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warn\n  ing at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death\n  sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffec\n  tive assistance during the resentencing proceeding. The District\n  Court once again conditionally granted the writ. The Eleventh Cir\n  cuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s challenge to\n  his new death sentence was an unreviewable “second or successive”\n  challenge under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) because he could have raised his\n  fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n555 F. 3d 968, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV–B, concluding that because Magwood’s habeas application\n  challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not “second or suc\n  cessive” under §2244(b). Pp. 8–15, 17–22.\n    (a) This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a\n  “second or successive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).\n  The State contends that §2244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to\n  bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present. Under\n  this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s fair-warning claim was “sec\n2                       MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ond and successive” because he had an opportunity to raise it in his\n    first application but did not. Magwood counters that §2244(b) should\n    not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment interven\n    ing between habeas applications. This Court agrees. The phrase\n    “second or successive” is not defined by AEDPA and it is a “term of\n    art.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486. To determine its mean\n    ing, the Court looks first to the statutory context. Section 2244(b)’s\n    limitations apply only to a “habeas corpus application under §2254,”\n    i.e., an application on “behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n    judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1). Both §2254(b)’s text and the\n    relief it provides indicate that “second or successive” must be inter\n    preted with respect to the judgment challenged. A §2254 petitioner\n    “seeks invalidation . . . of the judgment authorizing [his] confine\n    ment,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83. If a conditional writ is\n    granted, “the State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or\n    a new sentencing proceeding).” Ibid. The State errs in contending\n    that, if §2254 is relevant at all, “custody” and not “judgment,” is the\n    proper reference because unlawful “custody” is the “substance” re\n    quirement for habeas relief. This argument is unpersuasive. Section\n    2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under\n    §2254. Because §2254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state\n    court judgment, that “judgment” is inextricable and essential to re\n    lief. It is a requirement that distinguishes §2254 from other statutes\n    permitting constitutional relief. See, e.g., §§2255, 2241. The State’s\n    “custody”-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying “sec\n    ond or successive” to any subsequent application filed before a pris\n    oner’s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous\n    custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy §2244(b)’s strict rules to\n    challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\n    statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result. Pp. 8–\n    13.\n       (b) This Court is also not convinced by the State’s argument that a\n    “one opportunity” rule would be consistent with the statute and\n    should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of pre\n    venting piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship. AEDPA uses “sec\n    ond or successive” to modify “application,” not “claim” as the State\n    contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of\n    §2244(b) that would “elid[e] the difference between an ‘application’\n    and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9. The State’s reading\n    also reflects a more fundamental error. It would undermine or ren\n    der superfluous much of §2244(b)(2). In some circumstances, it would\n    increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of\n    the-writ rules where §2244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions. In others, it\n    would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where §2244(b) mandates stricter\n  requirements. Pp. 13–15.\n     (c) This Court’s interpretation of §2244(b) is consistent with its\n  precedents. Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State in\n  vokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies “second\n  or successive” to an application challenging a new judgment, these\n  cases shed no light on the question presented here. Nor do post-\n  AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here. Only Burton v.\n  Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold ques\n  tion whether an application is “second or successive” if it challenges a\n  new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new\n  judgment is dispositive. In holding that both of the petitioner’s ha\n  beas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Bur\n  ton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment inter\n  vening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been\n  different. Here, there is such an intervening judgment. This is Mag\n  wood’s first application challenging that intervening judgment.\n  Magwood challenges not the trial court’s error in his first sentencing,\n  but the court’s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and\n  reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. Pp. 15, 17–21.\n     (d) Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underly\n  ing conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State’s objec\n  tion that this reading of §2244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a\n  conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application\n  challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\n  undisturbed conviction. Nor does the Court address whether Mag\n  wood’s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the\n  Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n  counsel claim.

After the Alabama courts denied\nrelief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings,\nMagwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus\nin Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction\nand his sentence. The District Court conditionally granted\nthe writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood\neither be released or resentenced. The state trial court\nconducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced\nMagwood to death. Magwood filed an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new\nsentence. The District Court once again conditionally\ngranted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new\nsentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nreversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s chal\nlenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable\n“second or successive” challenge under 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(b) because he could have mounted the same chal\nlenge to his original death sentence. We granted certio\n2                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrari, and now reverse. Because Magwood’s habeas appli\ncation1 challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is\nnot “second or successive” under §2244(b).\n                             I\n   After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served\nseveral years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama,\nunder the watch of Sheriff C. F. “Neil” Grantham. During\nhis incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of\nmental illness, became convinced that Grantham had\nimprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even\nupon his release. Magwood followed through on his\nthreat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his\nrelease, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sher\niff’s arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood\nshot him and fled the scene.\n   Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of\nan on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code\n§13–11–2(a)(5) (1975).2 He was tried in 1981. The prose\ncution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggra\nvated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought\nthe death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason\nof insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital\nmurder under §13–11–2(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of\ndeath based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.\n——————\n   1 Although 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) refers to a habeas “application,” we\n\nuse the word “petition” interchangeably with the word “application,” as\nwe have in our prior cases.\n   2 At the time of the murder, Alabama Code §13–11–2(a) provided: “If\n\nthe jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death\nwhen the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following\noffenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the\nindictment . . . .” The offenses included “murder of any . . . sheriff . . .\nwhile . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.” §13–\n11–2(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of “aggravating circum\nstances,” §13–11–6, but the trial court found that none existed in\nMagwood’s case.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Weighing the aggravation against the two\nmitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of\ndeath. The Alabama courts affirmed.

In Kyzer, the defen\ndant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of “two or\nmore human beings” under §13–11–2(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.\nThe crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,\njust as Magwood’s crime of murder, as defined under §13–11–2(a)(5),\nwas aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of\nthe sheriff’s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court\nultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower\ncourt on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged\ncrime, see §13–11–2(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death\neven without a finding of any “aggravating circumstance” enumerated\nin §13–11–6. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was\nconvicted under §13–11–2(a)(10), “the jury and the trial judge at the\nsentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict\nment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is\nnot listed in §13–11–6 as an aggravating circumstance.” Id., at 339\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n4                     MAGWOOD v.

S. C. §2254, and the District Court granted a stay of\nexecution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court\nupheld Magwood’s conviction but vacated his sentence and\nconditionally granted the writ based on the trial court’s\nfailure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating\nto Magwood’s mental state.5 See Magwood v.

See 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286; supra,\nat 5. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that\nMagwood’s death sentence was unconstitutional because\n“at the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have\nfair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at\nleast one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former\n1975 Ala. Code §13–11–6.” 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The\nDistrict Court also found the state court’s grounds for\nrejecting Magwood’s ineffective-assistance claim unrea\nsonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting\nthat Magwood’s attorney in fact had engaged substan\ntively in the “complete and new” resentencing, and al\nthough the attorney could not be expected to object on\nstate-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly\nineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning\nclaim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 555\nF. 3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in\ndetermining whether §2244(b) applies is to “separate the\nnew claims challenging the resentencing from the old\nclaims that were or should have been presented in the\nprior application.” Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Under the Court of Appeals’ approach, any\nclaim that “challenge[s] the new, amended component of\nthe sentence” should be “regarded as part of a first peti\ntion,” and any claim that “challenge[s] any component of\nthe original sentence that was not amended” should be\n“regarded as part of a second petition.” Ibid. Applying\nthis test, the court held that because Magwood’s fair\n8                    MAGWOOD v.

Id., at 975–976. The\nCourt of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Mag\nwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the\nexceptions to §2244(b)’s general rule requiring dismissal of\nclaims first presented in a successive application.7 See id.,\nat 976.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood’s\napplication challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed\nas part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ\nfrom the District Court, is subject to the constraints that\n§2244(b) imposes on the review of “second or successive”\nhabeas applications. 558 U.

More specifically, it turns on\nwhen a claim should be deemed to arise in a “second or\nsuccessive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).\nIf an application is “second or successive,” the petitioner\nmust obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing\nit with the district court. See §2244(b)(3)(A). The district\ncourt must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized\nsecond or successive application unless the applicant\nshows that the claim satisfies certain statutory require\nments. See §2244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood’s application\nwas “second or successive,” the District Court should have\ndismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the\nrequisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If,\nhowever, Magwood’s application was not second or succes\nsive, it was not subject to §2244(b) at all, and his fair\nwarning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).\n   The State contends that although §2244(b), as amended\nby AEDPA, applies the phrase “second or successive” to\n“application[s],” it “is a claim-focused statute,” Brief for\nRespondents 22–24, and “[c]laims, not applications, are\nbarred by §2244(b),” id., at 24 (citing Artuz v. Bennett, 531\n10                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 4, 9 (2000)). According to the State, the phrase\nshould be read to reflect a principle that “a prisoner is\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to\nwage a collateral attack.” See Brief for Respondents\n25–26 (citing Beyer v. Litscher, 306 F. 3d 504, 508 (CA7\n2002); internal quotation marks omitted). The State\nasserts that under this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s\nfair-warning claim was successive because he had an\nopportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not\ndo so. See Brief for Respondents 25–26.\n   Magwood, in contrast, reads §2244(b) to apply only to a\n“second or successive” application challenging the same\nstate-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986\nresentencing led to a new judgment, and his first applica\ntion challenging that new judgment cannot be “second or\nsuccessive” such that §2244(b) would apply. We agree.\n   We begin with the text. Although Congress did not\ndefine the phrase “second or successive,” as used to modify\n“habeas corpus application under section 2254,”\n§§2244(b)(1)–(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not\nsimply “refe[r] to all §2254 applications filed second or\nsuccessively in time,” Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930, 944 (2007); see id., at 947 (creating an “exceptio[n]” to\n§2244(b) for a second application raising a claim that\nwould have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in\nhis first application); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523\nU. S. 637, 643 (1998) (treating a second application as part\nof a first application where it was premised on a newly\nripened claim that had been dismissed from the first\napplication “as premature”); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S.\n473, 478, 487 (2000) (declining to apply §2244(b) to a\nsecond application where the District Court dismissed the\nfirst application for lack of exhaustion).8\n——————\n  8 In Slack v.

S. ____ (2010)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have described the phrase “second or successive” as\na “term of art.” Id., at 486. To determine its meaning, we\nlook first to the statutory context. The limitations im\nposed by §2244(b) apply only to a “habeas corpus applica\ntion under §2254,” that is, an “application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The reference to a state-court judgment in\n§2254(b) is significant because the term “application”\ncannot be defined in a vacuum. A §2254 petitioner is\napplying for something: His petition “seeks invalidation\n(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris\noner’s confinement,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83\n(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis\ntrict court’s granting of the writ, “the State may seek a\nnew judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing\nproceeding).” Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both\n§2254(b)’s text and the relief it provides indicate that the\nphrase “second or successive” must be interpreted with\nrespect to the judgment challenged.\n   The State disagrees, contending that if the cross\nreference to §2254 is relevant, we should focus not on the\nstatute’s reference to a “judgment” but on its reference to\n“custody,” Brief for Respondents 53; compare §§2254(a),\n(b) (establishing rules for review of “an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus” on “behalf of a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court” (emphasis\nadded)) with §2254(a) (specifying that an application may\nbe entertained “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is\nin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea\nties of the United States” (emphasis added)). The State\nexplains that unlawful “custody” is the key “ ‘substance\n—————— \n\nAEDPA.” 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-\n\nAEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question\n\npresented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13. \n\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement’ ” of §2254, whereas being held pursuant to a\nstate-court “judgment” is merely a “ ‘status requirement.’ ”\nBrief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman & Hertz,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §8.1,\np. 391).\n   We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254\narticulates the kind of confinement that may be chal\nlenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held “in\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.” §2254(a). The requirement of custody\npursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes §2254\nfrom other statutory provisions authorizing relief from\nconstitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows\nchallenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42\nU. S. C. §1983, which allows federal-court suits against\nstate and local officials. Custody is crucial for §2254\npurposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that\nauthorizes it.\n   The State’s “custody”-based rule is difficult to justify for\nanother reason. Under the State’s approach, applying the\nphrase “second or successive” to any subsequent applica\ntion filed before a prisoner’s release would mean that a\nprisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com\npletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the\nstrict rules for review under §2244(b) to challenge his\nunrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\nstatutory text or context supports, much less requires,\nsuch an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at\n507 (“[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral\nattack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of\nimprisonment”); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85 (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (“[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one\nof several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate\nthe challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

According to the State, a\n“one opportunity” rule is consistent with the statutory\ntext, and better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of preventing\npiecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.\n   We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase “second\nor successive” to modify “application.” See §§2244(b)(1),\n(2). The State reads the phrase to modify “claims.” See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (“Congress’ intent for\nAEDPA was to eradicate successive claims”). We cannot\nreplace the actual text with speculation as to Congress’\nintent. We have previously found Congress’ use of the\nword “application” significant, and have refused to adopt\nan interpretation of §2244(b) that would “elid[e] the differ\nence between an ‘application’ and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz, 531\nU. S., at 9; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 530\n(2005) (“[F]or purposes of §2244(b), an ‘application’ for\nhabeas relief is a filing that contains one or more\n‘claims’ ”). Therefore, although we agree with the State\nthat many of the rules under §2244(b) focus on claims,\nthat does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the\nphrase “second or successive” modify claims as well.10\n   The State’s reading leads to a second, more fundamental\n——————\n   9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements.\n\nSee Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to “ask for relief\nfrom the state-court judgment being contested”); Rule 2(e) (prescribing\nthat any “petitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one\nstate court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or\njudgments of each court”).\n   10 The dissent recognizes that the phrase “second or successive” ap\n\nplies to an application as a whole, see post, at 2–4 (opinion of KENNEDY,\nJ.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see\ninfra, at 14–15.\n14                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nerror. Under the State’s “one opportunity” rule, the\nphrase “second or successive” would apply to any claim\nthat the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise\nin a prior application. And the phrase “second or succes\nsive” would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not\nhave a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.\n   This reading of §2244(b) would considerably under\nmine—if not render superfluous—the exceptions to dis\nmissal set forth in §2244(b)(2). That section describes\ncircumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be\nconsidered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly\ndiscovered facts suggesting “that . . . no reasonable fact\nfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the under\nlying offense.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,\na petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity\nto raise the claim, so under the State’s rule the claim\nwould not be successive and §2244(b)(2) would not apply to\nit at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised\nin a second application challenging the same judgment.11\n   In addition to duplicating the exceptions under §2244(b)\nin some circumstances, the State’s rule would dilute them\nin others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact\nbased claims not presented in a prior application applies\nonly if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence\n——————\n  11 This case does not require us to determine whether §2244(b) ap\n\nplies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a\nstate-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court\njudgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,\n523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945\n(2007).\n  The dissent’s claim that our reading of §2244(b) calls one of those\ndecisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 7–8, is unfounded. The\nquestion in this case is whether a first application challenging a new\nsentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not\nwhether an application challenging the same state-court judgment\nmust always be second or successive.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense,” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State’s rule, all that\nmatters is that the facts “could not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence,”\n§2244(b)(2)(B)(i). We decline to adopt a reading that\nwould thus truncate §2244(b)(2)’s requirements.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that\nthe approach we take here contradicts our precedents.\nThe State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying\nreview of claims in second or successive applications\nwhere the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior\nopportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.\nUnited States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465\nU. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464\nU. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320\n(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467\n(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag\nwood’s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second\nor successive because he could have raised—but did not\nraise—the claim in his first application.\n   But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the\nphrase “second or successive” to an application challenging\na new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on\nthe question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the\nwrit rules, as modified by AEDPA under §2244(b)(2), apply\nat all to an application challenging a new judgment. The\nState’s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its\nfailure to distinguish between §2244(b)’s threshold inquiry\ninto whether an application is “second or successive,” and\nits subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive\napplication must be dismissed.\n16                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase\n“second or successive” by reference to our longstanding\ndoctrine governing abuse of the writ. AEDPA modifies\nthose abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statu\ntory rules under §2244(b). These rules apply only to “sec\nond or successive” applications. The dissent contends that\nthis reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range\nof abusive claims that would have been barred under prior\nrules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this\nCourt has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the\npetitioner raised it in an application challenging a new\njudgment.\n   The dissent’s conclusion that our reading of §2254 “un\nmoor[s] the phrase ‘second or successive’ from its textual\nand historical underpinnings,” post, at 8, is unwarranted.\nPre-AEDPA usage of the phrase “second or successive” is\nconsistent with our reading. A review of our habeas\nprecedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirma\ntively define the phrase “second or successive” as it ap\npears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase\n“second or successive” to applications filed by state prison\ners until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose\nin the federal context, see §2255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and\napplied only to applications raising previously adjudicated\nclaims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 12\n(1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit\ndismissal of “abusive” claims—as distinguished from\n“successive” claims, see ibid.—Congress codified restric\ntions on both types of claims in §2244(b), but still without\nusing the phrase “second or successive.” See §2244(b)\n(1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applica\ntions filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not\nuntil 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase “second or\nsuccessive” into §2244(b). In light of this complex history\nof the phrase “second or successive,” we must rely upon\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Stewart, 549 U. S. 147 (2007) (per\ncuriam), comes close to addressing the threshold question\nwhether an application is “second or successive” if it chal\nlenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the\nexistence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the\npetitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court\nin 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen\ntencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.\nId., at 150. The state appellate court affirmed the convic\ntion but remanded for a second resentencing. Ibid. In\nMarch 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment\nand new sentence. Id., at 151. In December 1998, with\nstate review of his new sentence still pending, the peti\ntioner filed a §2254 application challenging his 1994 con\nviction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.\n   In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,\nthe petitioner filed a §2254 petition challenging only his\n1998 sentence.

Although petitioner had styled his first\npetition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his\nsecond petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we\nconcluded that both attacked the same “judgment” be\ncause the 1998 sentence was already in place when the\npetitioner filed his first application for federal habeas\nrelief. See id., at 156. In other words, the judgment he\nchallenged in his 1998 application was “the same one\nchallenged in the subsequent 2002 petition”; it “was the\njudgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being\ndetained.” Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recog\nnized that the case might have been different had there\nbeen a “new judgment intervening between the two ha\nbeas petitions.” Ibid. There was no such judgment in\nBurton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.\n   This is Magwood’s first application challenging that\nintervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is\nobvious to us—and the State does not dispute—that his\nclaim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon\nnew errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning\nclaim does not, because the state court made the same\nmistake before. We disagree. An error made a second\ntime is still a new error. That is especially clear here,\nwhere the state court conducted a full resentencing and\nreviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. See Sentencing\nTr., R. Tab 1, at R–25 (“The Court in f[or]mulating the\npresent judgment has considered the original record of the\ntrial and sentence. . . . The present judgment and sentence\nhas been the result of a complete and new assessment of all\nof the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law” (emphasis\nadded)).13\n——————\n  13 Cf. Walker v.

A petitioner may not raise\nin federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in\nstate court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the\nerror. If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural re\nquirements for bringing an error to the state court’s atten\ntion—whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings,\nas state law may require—procedural default will bar\nfederal review. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n729–730 (1991); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 848\n(1999) (stating that the petitioner’s “failure to present\nthree of his federal habeas claims to the [state court] in a\ntimely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of\nthose claims”). In this case, the State argued that Mag\nwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by\nfailing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the\n1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground.\nOnly after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally\ndefault the claim did the District Court sua sponte con\nsider whether §2244(b) barred review.14 We leave that\nprocedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review\nin the first instance.

United States,\n540 U. S. 375, 381 (2003). Many examples can be given,\nbut one suffices to illustrate this point. Suppose that a\npetitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious\nclaims challenging his conviction. The district court\ngrants a conditional writ based on one of them, without\nreaching the remaining nine. Upon retrial, the state court\ncommits the same 10 legal mistakes. (These are new\nerrors, but no more new than the sentencing error in\nMagwood’s case.) Is an application presenting those same\n10 claims—now based on the errors in the new judg\nment—“second or successive”? Under the opportunity\nbased rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the\nanswer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dis\nmissed. See §2244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim\npresented in a prior application). The State attempts to\navoid this “procedural anomal[y],” Castro, supra, at 380,\nby suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims\nas part of a first application, because they were never\nadjudicated on the merits. Cf. Slack, 529 U. S., at\n478–481; Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 643–645.

We see no need to engage in such novel and complex\nrationalizations.    AEDPA’s text commands a more\nstraightforward rule: where, unlike in Burton, there is a\n“new judgment intervening between the two habeas peti\ntions,” 549 U. S., at 156, an application challenging the\nresulting new judgment is not “second or successive” at all.\n                            V\n   The State objects that our reading of §2244(b) would\nallow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his\nsentence to file a subsequent application challenging not\nonly his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\nundisturbed conviction. The State believes this result\nfollows because a sentence and conviction form a single\n“judgment” for purposes of habeas review. This case gives\nus no occasion to address that question, because Magwood\nhas not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16\nWe base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not\naltered by consequences the State speculates will follow in\nanother case.17\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood’s first\napplication challenging his new sentence under the 1986\njudgment is not “second or successive” under §2244(b).\n\n——————\n  16 Several Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds\non a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the\n“portion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful\naction.” Lang v.

The Court neither purports to alter nor\ndoes alter our holding in Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930 (2007). See ante, at 14, n. 11. In Panetti, we “declined\nto interpret ‘second or successive’ as referring to all §2254\napplications filed second or successively in time, even\nwhen the later filings address a state-court judgment\nalready challenged in a prior §2254 application.” 551 U. S.\nat 944 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, we\ndetermine how 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) applies to a habeas\npetition that is the first petition to address a new “state\ncourt judgment” that has not “already [been] challenged in\na prior §2254 application.” And, for the reasons provided\nby the Court, such a “first” petition is not “second or suc\ncessive.” Of course, as the dissent correctly states, if\nMagwood were challenging an undisturbed state-court\njudgment for the second time, abuse-of-the-writ principles\nwould apply, including Panetti’s holding that an “applica\ntion” containing a “claim” that “the petitioner had no fair\nopportunity to raise” in his first habeas petition is not a\n“second or successive” application. Post, at 3 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.).

The Court, in my\nrespectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misread\ning precedents on the meaning of the phrase “second or\nsuccessive” in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The Court then rewrites\nAEDPA’s text but refuses to grapple with the logical con\nsequences of its own editorial judgment. A straightfor\nward application of the principles articulated in Panetti v.\nQuarterman, 551 U. S. 930 (2007), consistent with the\nconclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have con\nsidered this issue, dictates the opposite result. The design\nand purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of\nhabeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ’s\nintrusive effect on state criminal justice systems. But\ntoday’s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step\nback from AEDPA protection for States but also a step\nback even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in\nplace before AEDPA. So this respectful dissent becomes\nnecessary.\n2                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n  Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the\nrelevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:\n    “A claim presented in a second or successive habeas\n    corpus application under section 2254 that was not\n    presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\n    . . . .” 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2).\nThe question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy\nJoe Magwood filed “a second or successive” application by\nraising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had\navailable and yet failed to raise in his first petition.\n   The term “second or successive” is a habeas “term of\nart.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It\nincorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi\nple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to\ndetermine whether an application is “second or succes\nsive,” a court must look to the substance of the claim the\napplication raises and decide whether the petitioner had a\nfull and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior\napplication. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this\nanalytical framework puts applications into one of three\ncategories.\n   First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to\nraise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time\napplication that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as\n“second or successive.” This is consistent with pre-AEDPA\ncases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar\non “second or successive” applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo\nv. United States, 265 U. S. 239, 241 (1924) (second applica\ntion barred where petitioner had a “full opportunity to\noffer proof” of the same claim in his first habeas applica\ntion); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U. S. 377, 379 (1984)\n(Powell, J., concurring, writing for a majority of the Court)\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n(second application barred for claims that “could and\nshould have been raised in [the] first petition”); Delo v.\nStokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (subsequent\napplication barred for a claim that “could have been raised\nin his first petition for federal habeas corpus”). As\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, “a\npetitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub\nsequent petition that he could have raised in his first,\nregardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier\nstemmed from a deliberate choice.” See also Habeas Cor\npus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to “specify all\nthe grounds for relief available to [them]” and to “state the\nfacts supporting each ground”); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298, 317–323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,\nthrough legislation and judicial decision, of modified res\njudicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§4406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata doctrine bars “matters that [were not, but] ought\nto have been raised” in prior litigation).\n   Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise\nthe claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica\ntion raising that claim is not “second or successive,” and\n§2244(b)(2)’s bar does not apply. This can occur where the\nclaim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,\ne.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation\noccurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as\nthe State’s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required\nby state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898–\n899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v. Norris, 251 F. 3d 720, 723–725\n(CA8 2001); In re Cain, 137 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).\nAnd to respond to the Court’s concern, see ante, at 20, if\nthe applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he\nraised in his first petition but the District Court left unad\ndressed at its own discretion, the second application would\nnot be “second or successive.” Reraising a previously\n4                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the\nCourt believes there are “[m]any examples” where abuse\nof-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris\noners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would\nthink the Court would be able to come up with an exam\nple. It does not do so.\n   Third, a “mixed petition”—raising both abusive and\nnonabusive claims—would be “second or successive.” In\nthat circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain\nauthorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the\nnonabusive claims. See §2244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore\net al., Federal Practice §671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After\nthe court of appeals makes its determination, a district\ncourt may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner\nhad no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and\ndismiss the abusive claims. See §2244(b)(4).\n   The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the\nCourt’s decision in Panetti. Panetti’s claim that he was\nmentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain\nwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until\nafter the denial of his first habeas petition. When the\nFord claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas\npetition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con\ncluding that this second habeas petition was not a “second\nor successive” application, this Court explained that “sec\nond or successive” did not “refe[r] to all §2254 applications\nfiled second or successively in time,” but was rather a\nterm-of-art that “takes its full meaning from our case law,\nincluding decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].”\n551 U. S., at 943–944. The Court relied on AEDPA’s\npurpose of “ ‘further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,\nand federalism,’ ” id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the “empty\nformality requiring prisoners to file unripe” claims, 551\nU. S., at 946, and this Court’s pre-AEDPA cases regarding\nthe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nlooked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in\ntime habeas petition to determine that the application was\nnot “second or successive.” Ibid.\n  The above principles apply to a situation, like the pre\nsent one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceed\ning succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,\nwhich allows the state court to correct an error that oc\ncurred at the original sentencing. Assume, as alleged\nhere, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing\nproceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake\nthat also occurred at the first sentencing. The second\napplication is “second or successive” with respect to that\nclaim because the alleged error “could and should have”\nbeen raised in the first petition. Woodard, 464 U. S., at\n379 (opinion of Powell, J.). Put another way, under abuse\nof-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to chal\nlenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportu\nnity after his claim becomes ripe. On the other hand, if\nthe petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition\nthat could not have been raised in the earlier petition—\nperhaps because the error occurred for the first time dur\ning resentencing—then the application raising the claim is\nnot “second or successive” and §2244(b)(2)’s bar does not\napply.\n  Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to\nshow that the application in this case is “second or succes\nsive,” it must be noted that no previous case from this\nCourt has dealt with the precise sequence of events here:\nA petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim\nafter a second resentencing proceeding that followed a\ngrant of federal habeas relief. The conclusion that such an\napplication is barred as “second or successive” unless the\nclaim was previously unavailable is consistent with the\napproach of every court of appeals that has considered the\nissue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties\nthat are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.\n6                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nSee, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62–63 (CA1\n1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37–38 (CA2\n1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871\n(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351−353\n(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context\nof federal prisoners’ challenges to their convictions or\nsentences under 28 U. S. C. §2255, the “second or succes\nsive” bar under §2244(b) applies to §2255 motions. See\n§2255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).\n   In the present case the Court should conclude that\nMagwood has filed a “second or successive habeas corpus\napplication.” In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti\ntion raising nine claims, including that the trial court\nimproperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when\nit imposed Magwood’s death sentence. The District Court\ngranted Magwood’s petition and ordered relief only on the\nmitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a\nnew sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of\nthe mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.\nIn 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this\ntime raising an argument that could have been, but was\nnot, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he\nwas not eligible for the death penalty because he did not\nhave fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi\nble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have\nraised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.\nBecause Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju\ndicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in\n1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as\n“second or successive.”\n                             II\n  The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill\ndefined exception to the “second or successive” application\nbar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical\nerrors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti’s claim-based\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\napproach to determining whether an application is “second\nor successive.” Second, it imposes an atextual exception to\n§2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” applications,\nrequiring that the second-in-time application be brought\nagainst the same judgment. This second error is under\nscored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the\nlogical implications of its newly created rule.\n                              A\n   The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to\n“second or successive” applications rather than “second or\nsuccessive” claims, the nature of the claims raised in the\nsecond application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (“[A]l\nthough we agree with the State that many of the rules\nunder §2244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to\nrewrite the statute to make the phrase ‘second or succes\nsive’ modify claims as well”). This is incorrect. As ex\nplained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether\nan application itself is “second or successive” requires\nlooking to the nature of the claim that the application\nraises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and\nfair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.\nIndeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that\nthe application there was not “second or successive” was to\nlook at the underlying claim the application raised. 551\nU. S., at 947.\n   While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into\ndoubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to\nexplain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“Before\nAEDPA’s enactment, the phrase ‘second or successive’\nmeant the same thing it does today—any subsequent\nfederal habeas application challenging a state-court judg\nment”). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting\nits new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously\nunexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti\n8                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nto the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (“Today’s decision thus stands only for the\nproposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special\n(and unjustified) exemption from the statute’s plain\nimport”).\n   Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid\ning whether an application is barred as “second or succes\nsive” raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time\nhabeas petition challenging an alleged violation that\noccurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for\nexample, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time\npromised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of\ngood-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court’s\nrule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng\ning those alleged violations would be barred as “second or\nsuccessive” because it would be a second-in-time applica\ntion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.\nThat result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ\nprinciples and might work a suspension of the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\n                              B\n  Having unmoored the phrase “second or successive”\nfrom its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court\ncreates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is\nnot what makes an application “second or successive,”\nthen to what should a court look? Finding no reference\npoint in §2244(b)’s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for\na different peg.\n  The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different\nprovision:\n    “[A] district court shall entertain an application for a\n    writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody\n    pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the\n    ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti\n    tution or laws or treaties of the United States.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    §2254(a).\nBut this provision does not purport to create any prerequi\nsites to §2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” appli\ncations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is\nthat this is a mere “status requirement.” See 1 R. Hertz &\nJ. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce\ndure §8.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for\nthe simple proposition that a petitioner must be held\n“pursuant to the judgment of a State court” to be able to\nfile any §2254(b) petition in the first place. That reading\nalso explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not\nonly the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is\nbeing held but also “the duration of sentence . . . and . . .\nthe conditions under which that sentence is being served,”\nincluding rules such as “the basis of parole” and “good\ntime” credits. Id., §9.1, at 475–481.\n   The Court’s reading of the phrase “pursuant to the\njudgment of a State court” as a limitation on §2244(b)(2)’s\n“second or successive” application bar is artificial. The\nCourt would amend §2244(b)(2) to read: “A claim pre\nsented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\nunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior\napplication [against the same judgment] shall be dis\nmissed.” This is not what §2244(b)(2) says.\n   The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob\nlem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the\nnotion that “[a]n error made a second time is still a new\nerror.” Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the\nCourt can mean one of two very different things:\n   First, it could mean that any error logically encom\npassed in a reentered judgment is a “new” error. A crimi\nnal “judgment” generally includes both the conviction and\nthe sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a\ncriminal judgment “must set forth the plea, the jury ver\ndict or the court’s findings, the adjudication, and the\n10               MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsentence”); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)\n(“As we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily\nincludes the sentence imposed upon the defendant”). This\nwell-established principle applies in the federal habeas\ncontext, where petitioner is “in custody pursuant to the\njudgment.” §2254(b). A person cannot be held in custody\n“pursuant to” a sentence, but only pursuant to “the” (e.g.,\none) judgment, which includes both the conviction and\nsentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156–157\n(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations did not run until the judgment—“both his\nconviction and sentence became final” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Under this principle, the Court’s holding today would\nallow a challenger in Magwood’s position to raise any\nchallenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment\nagainst him in his second application, since a “new” judg\nment—consisting of both the conviction and sentence—has\nnow been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)\noccurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court\nhere reentered the following judgment after resentencing:\n“IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY\nTHE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the\noffense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag\nwood is sentenced to death.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.\nThis would mean that Magwood’s attorney could dig\nthrough anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross\nexamination of witnesses to the jury’s guilty verdict, and\nraise any alleged errors for the first time in his second\nhabeas application, all because the trial court did not\nproperly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood’s\nfirst sentencing proceeding.\n   Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even\nfurther from the statutory text and conclude that only\nsome parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal\nlenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfor example, argues that he can only challenge previously\nunraised errors made during sentencing. Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, n. 8. Indeed, Magwood goes further and sug\ngests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a\ncase where a court’s order leads the trial court to revise\nonly the defendant’s term of supervised release. Id., at 28,\nn. 11. If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the\ncriminal-judgment exception to the “second or successive”\napplication bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood\nnow raises is a “new error” at all. After all, Magwood did\nnot challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas peti\ntion but only disputed that he should not get the death\npenalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court prop\nerly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.\nThe state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no\nreason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Mag\nwood is death eligible. It is hard to see how the trial\ncourt’s failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous death\neligibility finding is a “new error,” any more than its fail\nure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken\nplace at the guilt phase would have been new errors.\n   The Court contends the approach dictated by Panetti\n“considerably undermine[s]—if not render[s] superfluous,”\nante, at 14, the exceptions in §2244(b)(2), which allow a\npetitioner to bring a claim in a “second or successive”\napplication based on certain factual discoveries or based\non a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied\nretroactively. The Court seems to be saying that applying\nPanetti’s rule would make the exceptions superfluous,\nbecause any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would\nnecessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the\nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. But the Court misconceives\nthe scope of the rule that an application is only “second or\nsuccessive” if it raises for the first time a claim that could\nhave been raised before. A second petition raising a claim\nthat could have been raised in a prior petition, even\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthough strengthened by a new decision from this Court or\nbased upon newly discovered evidence, is still “second or\nsuccessive.” Thus this subsequent application would only\nbe permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection\n(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court’s approach that\nlimits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.\nUnder the Court’s theory, the “second or successive” bar\ndoes not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in\nMagwood’s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep\ntions would have no operation in that context.\n                               III\n   The Court’s approach disregards AEDPA’s “ ‘principles\nof comity, finality, and federalism.’ ” Panetti, 551 U. S., at\n945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the\nCourt’s newly created exception to the “second or succes\nsive” application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even\nthe most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc\ning would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims\nin his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he\nfailed to raise in his first petition. “[I]f reexamination of\n[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal\nism and comity, the offense increases when a State must\ndefend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas\nproceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti\ntion.” McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.\n   The Court’s novel exception would also allow the once\nsuccessful petitioner to reraise every argument against a\nsentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the\nfirst round of federal habeas review. As respondents\nexplain, under the Court’s theory, “a post-resentencing\npetitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the\nwords, ‘§2254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,’ to his\npreviously adjudicated petition.” Brief for Respondents\n47. Because traditional res judicata principles do not\napply to federal habeas proceedings, see Salinger v. Loisel,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924), this would force federal courts\nto address twice (or thrice, or more) the same claims of\nerror. The State and the victims would have to bear anew\nthe “ significant costs of federal habeas corpus review,”\nMcCleskey, supra, at 490–491, all because the petitioner\npreviously succeeded on a wholly different, discrete, and\npossibly unrelated claim.\n   The Court’s suggestion that “[i]t will not take a court\nlong to dispose of such claims where the court has already\nanalyzed the legal issues,” ante, at 20, n. 15, misses the\npoint. This reassurance will be cold comfort to overworked\nstate district attorneys, who will now have to waste time\nand resources writing briefs analyzing dozens of claims\nthat should be barred by abuse-of-the-writ principles. It is\ndifficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals\nto do their best work, day after day, when they have to\ndeal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously\nrejected or otherwise abusive claims. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court is mandating, under a statute that was\ndesigned to require just the opposite result. If the analy\nsis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States\nwill document the ill effects of the Court’s opinion so that\nits costs and deficiencies are better understood if this\nissue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.\n   The Court’s new exception will apply not only to death\npenalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised\nclaim appears arguably meritorious. It will apply to all\nfederal habeas petitions following a prior successful peti\ntion, most of which will not be in death cases and where\nthe abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack\nmerit. And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court’s\ndecision means that States subject to federal habeas re\nview henceforth receive less recognition of a finality inter\nest than the Federal Government does on direct review of\nfederal criminal convictions. See United States v. Parker,\n101 F. 3d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (“A party\n14                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second\nappeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in\nthe first appeal because the remand did not affect it”).\n   The Court’s approach also turns AEDPA’s bar against\n“second or successive” applications into a one-way ratchet\nthat favors habeas petitioners. Unless today’s decision is\nread to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7–8, AEDPA\nstill incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of\nthe-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ\nously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But after today’s holding, AEDPA now “modi\nfie[s],” ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows\npetitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have\nwon any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti\ntion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new\nloophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge\ntheir sentences based on grounds they previously ne\nglected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand\ning that AEDPA adds “new restrictions on successive\npetitions” and “further restricts the availability of relief to\nhabeas petitioners.” Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664\n(1996).\n                        *    *     *\n  Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all\nagree that claims then available, but not raised, would be\nbarred.

The Court is mistaken in concluding that\nCongress, in enacting a statute aimed at placing new\nrestrictions on successive petitions, would have intended\nthis irrational result.\n  Magwood had every chance to raise his death-eligibility\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Argued March 24, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder. After the Ala\n  bama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction pro\n  ceedings, he sought federal habeas relief. The District Court condi\n  tionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be\n  released or resentenced. The state trial court sentenced him to death\n  a second time. He filed another federal habeas application, challeng\n  ing this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warn\n  ing at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death\n  sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffec\n  tive assistance during the resentencing proceeding. The District\n  Court once again conditionally granted the writ. The Eleventh Cir\n  cuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s challenge to\n  his new death sentence was an unreviewable “second or successive”\n  challenge under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) because he could have raised his\n  fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n555 F. 3d 968, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV–B, concluding that because Magwood’s habeas application\n  challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not “second or suc\n  cessive” under §2244(b). Pp. 8–15, 17–22.\n    (a) This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a\n  “second or successive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).\n  The State contends that §2244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to\n  bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present. Under\n  this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s fair-warning claim was “sec\n2                       MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ond and successive” because he had an opportunity to raise it in his\n    first application but did not. Magwood counters that §2244(b) should\n    not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment interven\n    ing between habeas applications. This Court agrees. The phrase\n    “second or successive” is not defined by AEDPA and it is a “term of\n    art.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486. To determine its mean\n    ing, the Court looks first to the statutory context. Section 2244(b)’s\n    limitations apply only to a “habeas corpus application under §2254,”\n    i.e., an application on “behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n    judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1). Both §2254(b)’s text and the\n    relief it provides indicate that “second or successive” must be inter\n    preted with respect to the judgment challenged. A §2254 petitioner\n    “seeks invalidation . . . of the judgment authorizing [his] confine\n    ment,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83. If a conditional writ is\n    granted, “the State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or\n    a new sentencing proceeding).” Ibid. The State errs in contending\n    that, if §2254 is relevant at all, “custody” and not “judgment,” is the\n    proper reference because unlawful “custody” is the “substance” re\n    quirement for habeas relief. This argument is unpersuasive. Section\n    2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under\n    §2254. Because §2254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state\n    court judgment, that “judgment” is inextricable and essential to re\n    lief. It is a requirement that distinguishes §2254 from other statutes\n    permitting constitutional relief. See, e.g., §§2255, 2241. The State’s\n    “custody”-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying “sec\n    ond or successive” to any subsequent application filed before a pris\n    oner’s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous\n    custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy §2244(b)’s strict rules to\n    challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\n    statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result. Pp. 8–\n    13.\n       (b) This Court is also not convinced by the State’s argument that a\n    “one opportunity” rule would be consistent with the statute and\n    should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of pre\n    venting piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship. AEDPA uses “sec\n    ond or successive” to modify “application,” not “claim” as the State\n    contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of\n    §2244(b) that would “elid[e] the difference between an ‘application’\n    and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9. The State’s reading\n    also reflects a more fundamental error. It would undermine or ren\n    der superfluous much of §2244(b)(2). In some circumstances, it would\n    increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of\n    the-writ rules where §2244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions. In others, it\n    would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where §2244(b) mandates stricter\n  requirements. Pp. 13–15.\n     (c) This Court’s interpretation of §2244(b) is consistent with its\n  precedents. Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State in\n  vokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies “second\n  or successive” to an application challenging a new judgment, these\n  cases shed no light on the question presented here. Nor do post-\n  AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here. Only Burton v.\n  Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold ques\n  tion whether an application is “second or successive” if it challenges a\n  new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new\n  judgment is dispositive. In holding that both of the petitioner’s ha\n  beas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Bur\n  ton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment inter\n  vening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been\n  different. Here, there is such an intervening judgment. This is Mag\n  wood’s first application challenging that intervening judgment.\n  Magwood challenges not the trial court’s error in his first sentencing,\n  but the court’s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and\n  reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. Pp. 15, 17–21.\n     (d) Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underly\n  ing conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State’s objec\n  tion that this reading of §2244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a\n  conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application\n  challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\n  undisturbed conviction. Nor does the Court address whether Mag\n  wood’s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the\n  Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n  counsel claim.

Magwood filed an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new\nsentence. The District Court once again conditionally\ngranted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new\nsentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nreversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s chal\nlenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable\n“second or successive” challenge under 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(b) because he could have mounted the same chal\nlenge to his original death sentence. We granted certio\n2                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrari, and now reverse. Because Magwood’s habeas appli\ncation1 challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is\nnot “second or successive” under §2244(b).\n                             I\n   After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served\nseveral years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama,\nunder the watch of Sheriff C. F. “Neil” Grantham. During\nhis incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of\nmental illness, became convinced that Grantham had\nimprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even\nupon his release. Magwood followed through on his\nthreat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his\nrelease, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sher\niff’s arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood\nshot him and fled the scene.\n   Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of\nan on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code\n§13–11–2(a)(5) (1975).2 He was tried in 1981. The prose\ncution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggra\nvated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought\nthe death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason\nof insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital\nmurder under §13–11–2(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of\ndeath based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.\n——————\n   1 Although 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) refers to a habeas “application,” we\n\nuse the word “petition” interchangeably with the word “application,” as\nwe have in our prior cases.\n   2 At the time of the murder, Alabama Code §13–11–2(a) provided: “If\n\nthe jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death\nwhen the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following\noffenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the\nindictment . . . .” The offenses included “murder of any . . . sheriff . . .\nwhile . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.” §13–\n11–2(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of “aggravating circum\nstances,” §13–11–6, but the trial court found that none existed in\nMagwood’s case.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nIn accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed\nthe basis for the jury’s decision. See §§13–11–3, 13–11–4.\nAlthough the court did not find the existence of any statu\ntory “aggravating circumstance” under §13–11–6, the\ncourt relied on Ex parte Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330 (Ala. 1981),\nto find that murder of a sheriff while “on duty or because\nof some official or job-related acts,” §13–11–2(a)(5), is a\ncapital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation\nsufficient for a death sentence.3 The trial court found that\nMagwood’s young age (27 at the time of the offense) and\nlack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating\nfactors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood’s\nmental state. Weighing the aggravation against the two\nmitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of\ndeath. The Alabama courts affirmed. See Magwood v.\nState, 426 So. 2d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Ex parte\nMagwood, 426 So. 2d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983). We denied\ncertiorari. Magwood v. Alabama, 462 U. S. 1124 (1983).\nAfter the Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date of\n——————\n   3 As relevant here, Kyzer did away with the prior Alabama rule that\n\nan aggravating component of a capital felony could not double as an\naggravating factor supporting a capital sentence. In Kyzer, the defen\ndant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of “two or\nmore human beings” under §13–11–2(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.\nThe crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,\njust as Magwood’s crime of murder, as defined under §13–11–2(a)(5),\nwas aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of\nthe sheriff’s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court\nultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower\ncourt on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged\ncrime, see §13–11–2(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death\neven without a finding of any “aggravating circumstance” enumerated\nin §13–11–6. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was\nconvicted under §13–11–2(a)(10), “the jury and the trial judge at the\nsentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict\nment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is\nnot listed in §13–11–6 as an aggravating circumstance.” Id., at 339\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n4                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nJuly 22, 1983, Magwood filed a coram nobis petition and\nan application for a stay of execution. The trial court held\na hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18,\n1983.4\n   Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood\nfiled an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. §2254, and the District Court granted a stay of\nexecution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court\nupheld Magwood’s conviction but vacated his sentence and\nconditionally granted the writ based on the trial court’s\nfailure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating\nto Magwood’s mental state.5 See Magwood v. Smith, 608\nF. Supp. 218, 225–226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985). The Court of\nAppeals affirmed. See Magwood v. Smith, 791 F. 2d 1438,\n1450 (CA11 1986).\n   In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court\nheld a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.\nThis time, the judge found that Magwood’s mental state,\nas well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as\nstatutory mitigating circumstances. As before, the court\nfound that Magwood’s capital felony under §13–11–2(a)(5)\nincluded sufficient aggravation to render him death eligi\nble. In his proposed findings, Magwood’s attorney agreed\nthat Magwood’s offense rendered him death eligible, but\nargued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in\nlight of the mitigating factors. The trial court imposed a\n——————\n    4 The  Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently affirmed the\ndenial of Magwood’s coram nobis petition, see Magwood v.

S. 923 (1989).\n   Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama’s\nformer Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987)\n(now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming,\ninter alia, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum\nsentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence\nviolated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nbecause it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of\nthe capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney ren\ndered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentenc\ning. The trial court denied relief. It held that the statu\ntory basis for Magwood’s death sentence had been\naffirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The\ntrial court also held that Magwood’s attorney played no\nsubstantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation\nto dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court\nhad required only that the trial court consider additional\nmitigating factors.\n   Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition,\narguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional\nbecause he did not have fair warning that his offense could\nbe punished by death, and that he received constitution\nally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing. See\nRecord in Appeal No. 92–843 (Ala. Crim. App.), Tab 25,\npp. 23–24, 53–61.\n   The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, citing\nits decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the\ndeath sentence. See Magwood v. State, 689 So. 2d 959,\n965 (1996) (citing Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330, and Jackson v.\n6                  MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nState, 501 So. 2d 542 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986)).6 The Ala\nbama Supreme Court denied certiorari, see 689 So. 2d, at\n959, as did this Court, see Magwood v. Alabama, 522 U. S.\n836 (1997).\n   In April 1997, Magwood sought leave to file a second or\nsuccessive application for a writ of habeas corpus challeng\ning his 1981 judgment of conviction. See §2244(b)(3)(A)\n(requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a\nsecond or successive application). The Court of Appeals\ndenied his request. See In re Magwood, 113 F. 3d 1544\n(CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,\nwhich the District Court conditionally granted. See Mag\nwood v. Culliver, 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala.\n2007). In that petition, Magwood again argued that his\nsentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair\nwarning at the time of his offense that his conduct would\nbe sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama\nlaw, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance\nduring the resentencing proceeding.\n   Before addressing the merits of Magwood’s fair-warning\nclaim, the District Court sua sponte considered whether\nthe application was barred as a “successive petition” under\n§2244, and concluded that it was not.

See 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286; supra,\nat 5. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that\nMagwood’s death sentence was unconstitutional because\n“at the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have\nfair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at\nleast one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former\n1975 Ala. Code §13–11–6.” 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The\nDistrict Court also found the state court’s grounds for\nrejecting Magwood’s ineffective-assistance claim unrea\nsonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting\nthat Magwood’s attorney in fact had engaged substan\ntively in the “complete and new” resentencing, and al\nthough the attorney could not be expected to object on\nstate-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly\nineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning\nclaim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 555\nF. 3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in\ndetermining whether §2244(b) applies is to “separate the\nnew claims challenging the resentencing from the old\nclaims that were or should have been presented in the\nprior application.” Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Under the Court of Appeals’ approach, any\nclaim that “challenge[s] the new, amended component of\nthe sentence” should be “regarded as part of a first peti\ntion,” and any claim that “challenge[s] any component of\nthe original sentence that was not amended” should be\n“regarded as part of a second petition.” Ibid. Applying\nthis test, the court held that because Magwood’s fair\n8                    MAGWOOD v.

Id., at 975–976. The\nCourt of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Mag\nwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the\nexceptions to §2244(b)’s general rule requiring dismissal of\nclaims first presented in a successive application.7 See id.,\nat 976.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood’s\napplication challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed\nas part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ\nfrom the District Court, is subject to the constraints that\n§2244(b) imposes on the review of “second or successive”\nhabeas applications. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                         II\n  As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.

More specifically, it turns on\nwhen a claim should be deemed to arise in a “second or\nsuccessive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).\nIf an application is “second or successive,” the petitioner\nmust obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing\nit with the district court. See §2244(b)(3)(A). The district\ncourt must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized\nsecond or successive application unless the applicant\nshows that the claim satisfies certain statutory require\nments. See §2244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood’s application\nwas “second or successive,” the District Court should have\ndismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the\nrequisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If,\nhowever, Magwood’s application was not second or succes\nsive, it was not subject to §2244(b) at all, and his fair\nwarning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).\n   The State contends that although §2244(b), as amended\nby AEDPA, applies the phrase “second or successive” to\n“application[s],” it “is a claim-focused statute,” Brief for\nRespondents 22–24, and “[c]laims, not applications, are\nbarred by §2244(b),” id., at 24 (citing Artuz v. Bennett, 531\n10                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 4, 9 (2000)). According to the State, the phrase\nshould be read to reflect a principle that “a prisoner is\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to\nwage a collateral attack.” See Brief for Respondents\n25–26 (citing Beyer v. Litscher, 306 F. 3d 504, 508 (CA7\n2002); internal quotation marks omitted). The State\nasserts that under this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s\nfair-warning claim was successive because he had an\nopportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not\ndo so. See Brief for Respondents 25–26.\n   Magwood, in contrast, reads §2244(b) to apply only to a\n“second or successive” application challenging the same\nstate-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986\nresentencing led to a new judgment, and his first applica\ntion challenging that new judgment cannot be “second or\nsuccessive” such that §2244(b) would apply. We agree.\n   We begin with the text. Although Congress did not\ndefine the phrase “second or successive,” as used to modify\n“habeas corpus application under section 2254,”\n§§2244(b)(1)–(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not\nsimply “refe[r] to all §2254 applications filed second or\nsuccessively in time,” Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930, 944 (2007); see id., at 947 (creating an “exceptio[n]” to\n§2244(b) for a second application raising a claim that\nwould have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in\nhis first application); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523\nU. S. 637, 643 (1998) (treating a second application as part\nof a first application where it was premised on a newly\nripened claim that had been dismissed from the first\napplication “as premature”); Slack v.

To determine its meaning, we\nlook first to the statutory context. The limitations im\nposed by §2244(b) apply only to a “habeas corpus applica\ntion under §2254,” that is, an “application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The reference to a state-court judgment in\n§2254(b) is significant because the term “application”\ncannot be defined in a vacuum. A §2254 petitioner is\napplying for something: His petition “seeks invalidation\n(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris\noner’s confinement,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83\n(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis\ntrict court’s granting of the writ, “the State may seek a\nnew judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing\nproceeding).” Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both\n§2254(b)’s text and the relief it provides indicate that the\nphrase “second or successive” must be interpreted with\nrespect to the judgment challenged.\n   The State disagrees, contending that if the cross\nreference to §2254 is relevant, we should focus not on the\nstatute’s reference to a “judgment” but on its reference to\n“custody,” Brief for Respondents 53; compare §§2254(a),\n(b) (establishing rules for review of “an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus” on “behalf of a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court” (emphasis\nadded)) with §2254(a) (specifying that an application may\nbe entertained “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is\nin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea\nties of the United States” (emphasis added)). The State\nexplains that unlawful “custody” is the key “ ‘substance\n—————— \n\nAEDPA.” 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-\n\nAEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question\n\npresented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13. \n\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement’ ” of §2254, whereas being held pursuant to a\nstate-court “judgment” is merely a “ ‘status requirement.’ ”\nBrief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman & Hertz,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §8.1,\np. 391).\n   We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254\narticulates the kind of confinement that may be chal\nlenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held “in\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.” §2254(a). The requirement of custody\npursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes §2254\nfrom other statutory provisions authorizing relief from\nconstitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows\nchallenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42\nU. S. C. §1983, which allows federal-court suits against\nstate and local officials. Custody is crucial for §2254\npurposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that\nauthorizes it.\n   The State’s “custody”-based rule is difficult to justify for\nanother reason. Under the State’s approach, applying the\nphrase “second or successive” to any subsequent applica\ntion filed before a prisoner’s release would mean that a\nprisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com\npletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the\nstrict rules for review under §2244(b) to challenge his\nunrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\nstatutory text or context supports, much less requires,\nsuch an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at\n507 (“[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral\nattack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of\nimprisonment”); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85 (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (“[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one\nof several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate\nthe challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

According to the State, a\n“one opportunity” rule is consistent with the statutory\ntext, and better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of preventing\npiecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.\n   We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase “second\nor successive” to modify “application.” See §§2244(b)(1),\n(2). The State reads the phrase to modify “claims.” See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (“Congress’ intent for\nAEDPA was to eradicate successive claims”). We cannot\nreplace the actual text with speculation as to Congress’\nintent. We have previously found Congress’ use of the\nword “application” significant, and have refused to adopt\nan interpretation of §2244(b) that would “elid[e] the differ\nence between an ‘application’ and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz, 531\nU. S., at 9; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 530\n(2005) (“[F]or purposes of §2244(b), an ‘application’ for\nhabeas relief is a filing that contains one or more\n‘claims’ ”). Therefore, although we agree with the State\nthat many of the rules under §2244(b) focus on claims,\nthat does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the\nphrase “second or successive” modify claims as well.10\n   The State’s reading leads to a second, more fundamental\n——————\n   9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements.\n\nSee Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to “ask for relief\nfrom the state-court judgment being contested”); Rule 2(e) (prescribing\nthat any “petitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one\nstate court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or\njudgments of each court”).\n   10 The dissent recognizes that the phrase “second or successive” ap\n\nplies to an application as a whole, see post, at 2–4 (opinion of KENNEDY,\nJ.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see\ninfra, at 14–15.\n14                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nerror. Under the State’s “one opportunity” rule, the\nphrase “second or successive” would apply to any claim\nthat the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise\nin a prior application. And the phrase “second or succes\nsive” would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not\nhave a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.\n   This reading of §2244(b) would considerably under\nmine—if not render superfluous—the exceptions to dis\nmissal set forth in §2244(b)(2). That section describes\ncircumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be\nconsidered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly\ndiscovered facts suggesting “that . . . no reasonable fact\nfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the under\nlying offense.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,\na petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity\nto raise the claim, so under the State’s rule the claim\nwould not be successive and §2244(b)(2) would not apply to\nit at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised\nin a second application challenging the same judgment.11\n   In addition to duplicating the exceptions under §2244(b)\nin some circumstances, the State’s rule would dilute them\nin others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact\nbased claims not presented in a prior application applies\nonly if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence\n——————\n  11 This case does not require us to determine whether §2244(b) ap\n\nplies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a\nstate-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court\njudgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,\n523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945\n(2007).\n  The dissent’s claim that our reading of §2244(b) calls one of those\ndecisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 7–8, is unfounded. The\nquestion in this case is whether a first application challenging a new\nsentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not\nwhether an application challenging the same state-court judgment\nmust always be second or successive.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense,” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State’s rule, all that\nmatters is that the facts “could not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence,”\n§2244(b)(2)(B)(i). We decline to adopt a reading that\nwould thus truncate §2244(b)(2)’s requirements.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that\nthe approach we take here contradicts our precedents.\nThe State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying\nreview of claims in second or successive applications\nwhere the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior\nopportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.\nUnited States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465\nU. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464\nU. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320\n(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467\n(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag\nwood’s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second\nor successive because he could have raised—but did not\nraise—the claim in his first application.\n   But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the\nphrase “second or successive” to an application challenging\na new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on\nthe question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the\nwrit rules, as modified by AEDPA under §2244(b)(2), apply\nat all to an application challenging a new judgment. The\nState’s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its\nfailure to distinguish between §2244(b)’s threshold inquiry\ninto whether an application is “second or successive,” and\nits subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive\napplication must be dismissed.\n16                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase\n“second or successive” by reference to our longstanding\ndoctrine governing abuse of the writ. AEDPA modifies\nthose abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statu\ntory rules under §2244(b). These rules apply only to “sec\nond or successive” applications. The dissent contends that\nthis reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range\nof abusive claims that would have been barred under prior\nrules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this\nCourt has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the\npetitioner raised it in an application challenging a new\njudgment.\n   The dissent’s conclusion that our reading of §2254 “un\nmoor[s] the phrase ‘second or successive’ from its textual\nand historical underpinnings,” post, at 8, is unwarranted.\nPre-AEDPA usage of the phrase “second or successive” is\nconsistent with our reading. A review of our habeas\nprecedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirma\ntively define the phrase “second or successive” as it ap\npears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase\n“second or successive” to applications filed by state prison\ners until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose\nin the federal context, see §2255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and\napplied only to applications raising previously adjudicated\nclaims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 12\n(1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit\ndismissal of “abusive” claims—as distinguished from\n“successive” claims, see ibid.—Congress codified restric\ntions on both types of claims in §2244(b), but still without\nusing the phrase “second or successive.” See §2244(b)\n(1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applica\ntions filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not\nuntil 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase “second or\nsuccessive” into §2244(b). In light of this complex history\nof the phrase “second or successive,” we must rely upon\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe current text to determine when the phrase applies,\nrather than pre-AEDPA precedents or superseded statu\ntory formulations.12\n                             C\n   Nor do our post-AEDPA cases contradict our approach.\nOnly one, Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147 (2007) (per\ncuriam), comes close to addressing the threshold question\nwhether an application is “second or successive” if it chal\nlenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the\nexistence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the\npetitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court\nin 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen\ntencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.\nId., at 150. The state appellate court affirmed the convic\ntion but remanded for a second resentencing. Ibid. In\nMarch 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment\nand new sentence. Id., at 151. In December 1998, with\nstate review of his new sentence still pending, the peti\ntioner filed a §2254 application challenging his 1994 con\nviction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.\n   In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,\nthe petitioner filed a §2254 petition challenging only his\n1998 sentence. The District Court denied relief on the\nmerits and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,\nholding that the petition challenging the sentence should\nhave been dismissed as an unauthorized “second or suc\ncessive” application. Id., at 153; see §2244(b)(3)(A). We\n\n——————\n  12 The dissent speculates about issues far beyond the question before\n\nthe Court. See, e.g., post, at 8–9 (suggesting that our judgment-based\nreading of §2244(b) calls into question precedents recognizing habeas\npetitions challenging the denial of good-time credits or parole). We\naddress only an application challenging a new state-court judgment for\nthe first time. We do not purport to constrain the scope of §2254 as we\nhave previously defined it.\n18                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected the petitioner’s argument “that his 1998 and 2002\npetitions challenged different judgments.” Id., at 155; see\nid., at 156–157. Although petitioner had styled his first\npetition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his\nsecond petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we\nconcluded that both attacked the same “judgment” be\ncause the 1998 sentence was already in place when the\npetitioner filed his first application for federal habeas\nrelief. See id., at 156. In other words, the judgment he\nchallenged in his 1998 application was “the same one\nchallenged in the subsequent 2002 petition”; it “was the\njudgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being\ndetained.” Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recog\nnized that the case might have been different had there\nbeen a “new judgment intervening between the two ha\nbeas petitions.” Ibid. There was no such judgment in\nBurton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.\n   This is Magwood’s first application challenging that\nintervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is\nobvious to us—and the State does not dispute—that his\nclaim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon\nnew errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning\nclaim does not, because the state court made the same\nmistake before. We disagree. An error made a second\ntime is still a new error. That is especially clear here,\nwhere the state court conducted a full resentencing and\nreviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. See Sentencing\nTr., R. Tab 1, at R–25 (“The Court in f[or]mulating the\npresent judgment has considered the original record of the\ntrial and sentence. . . . The present judgment and sentence\nhas been the result of a complete and new assessment of all\nof the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law” (emphasis\nadded)).13\n——————\n  13 Cf. Walker v. Roth, 133 F. 3d 454, 455 (CA7 1997) (“None of these\n\nnew claims were raised in his first petition, nor could they have been;\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

A petitioner may not raise\nin federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in\nstate court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the\nerror. If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural re\nquirements for bringing an error to the state court’s atten\ntion—whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings,\nas state law may require—procedural default will bar\nfederal review. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n729–730 (1991); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 848\n(1999) (stating that the petitioner’s “failure to present\nthree of his federal habeas claims to the [state court] in a\ntimely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of\nthose claims”). In this case, the State argued that Mag\nwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by\nfailing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the\n1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground.\nOnly after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally\ndefault the claim did the District Court sua sponte con\nsider whether §2244(b) barred review.14 We leave that\nprocedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review\nin the first instance. Here, we underscore only that proce\ndural-default rules continue to constrain review of claims\nin all applications, whether the applications are “second or\n\n——————\n[the petitioner] is attempting to challenge the constitutionality of a\nproceeding which obviously occurred after he filed, and obtained relief,\nin his first habeas petition”).\n  14 See 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1267 (MD Ala. 2007) (“This court split\n\nthe proceedings on the current petition into two stages: Stage I (deter\nmining whether the claims were procedurally defaulted) and Stage II\n(considering the merits of the claims that were not procedurally de\nfaulted)”). Few of Magwood’s claims survived the initial cut.\n20                    MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuccessive” or not.15\n   Ironically, in an effort to effectuate what they believe is\nCongress’ intent not to give any unfair benefit to habeas\npetitioners, the State and the dissent propose an alterna\ntive rule that would “close our doors to a class of habeas\npetitioners seeking review without any clear indication\nthat such was Congress’ intent.” Castro v. United States,\n540 U. S. 375, 381 (2003). Many examples can be given,\nbut one suffices to illustrate this point. Suppose that a\npetitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious\nclaims challenging his conviction. The district court\ngrants a conditional writ based on one of them, without\nreaching the remaining nine. Upon retrial, the state court\ncommits the same 10 legal mistakes. (These are new\nerrors, but no more new than the sentencing error in\nMagwood’s case.) Is an application presenting those same\n10 claims—now based on the errors in the new judg\nment—“second or successive”? Under the opportunity\nbased rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the\nanswer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dis\nmissed. See §2244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim\npresented in a prior application). The State attempts to\navoid this “procedural anomal[y],” Castro, supra, at 380,\nby suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims\nas part of a first application, because they were never\nadjudicated on the merits. Cf. Slack, 529 U. S., at\n478–481; Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 643–645. As for\nthe adjudicated claim, “[r]espondents assume that state\njudges will follow instructions imposed by federal courts,”\nand if not, “that federal courts will consider a petitioner’s\nclaim that the state court violated due process by failing to\n——————\n  15 The dissent’s concern that such a petitioner may “reraise every\n\nargument against a sentence that was rejected by the federal courts\nduring the first round of federal habeas review,” post, at 12, is similarly\nhyperbolic.

We see no need to engage in such novel and complex\nrationalizations.    AEDPA’s text commands a more\nstraightforward rule: where, unlike in Burton, there is a\n“new judgment intervening between the two habeas peti\ntions,” 549 U. S., at 156, an application challenging the\nresulting new judgment is not “second or successive” at all.\n                            V\n   The State objects that our reading of §2244(b) would\nallow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his\nsentence to file a subsequent application challenging not\nonly his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\nundisturbed conviction. The State believes this result\nfollows because a sentence and conviction form a single\n“judgment” for purposes of habeas review. This case gives\nus no occasion to address that question, because Magwood\nhas not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16\nWe base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not\naltered by consequences the State speculates will follow in\nanother case.17\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood’s first\napplication challenging his new sentence under the 1986\njudgment is not “second or successive” under §2244(b).\n\n——————\n  16 Several Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds\non a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the\n“portion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful\naction.” Lang v.

The Court neither purports to alter nor\ndoes alter our holding in Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930 (2007). See ante, at 14, n. 11. In Panetti, we “declined\nto interpret ‘second or successive’ as referring to all §2254\napplications filed second or successively in time, even\nwhen the later filings address a state-court judgment\nalready challenged in a prior §2254 application.” 551 U. S.\nat 944 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, we\ndetermine how 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) applies to a habeas\npetition that is the first petition to address a new “state\ncourt judgment” that has not “already [been] challenged in\na prior §2254 application.” And, for the reasons provided\nby the Court, such a “first” petition is not “second or suc\ncessive.” Of course, as the dissent correctly states, if\nMagwood were challenging an undisturbed state-court\njudgment for the second time, abuse-of-the-writ principles\nwould apply, including Panetti’s holding that an “applica\ntion” containing a “claim” that “the petitioner had no fair\nopportunity to raise” in his first habeas petition is not a\n“second or successive” application.

The Court, in my\nrespectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misread\ning precedents on the meaning of the phrase “second or\nsuccessive” in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The Court then rewrites\nAEDPA’s text but refuses to grapple with the logical con\nsequences of its own editorial judgment. A straightfor\nward application of the principles articulated in Panetti v.\nQuarterman, 551 U. S. 930 (2007), consistent with the\nconclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have con\nsidered this issue, dictates the opposite result. The design\nand purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of\nhabeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ’s\nintrusive effect on state criminal justice systems. But\ntoday’s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step\nback from AEDPA protection for States but also a step\nback even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in\nplace before AEDPA. So this respectful dissent becomes\nnecessary.\n2                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n  Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the\nrelevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:\n    “A claim presented in a second or successive habeas\n    corpus application under section 2254 that was not\n    presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\n    . . . .” 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2).\nThe question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy\nJoe Magwood filed “a second or successive” application by\nraising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had\navailable and yet failed to raise in his first petition.\n   The term “second or successive” is a habeas “term of\nart.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It\nincorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi\nple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to\ndetermine whether an application is “second or succes\nsive,” a court must look to the substance of the claim the\napplication raises and decide whether the petitioner had a\nfull and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior\napplication. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this\nanalytical framework puts applications into one of three\ncategories.\n   First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to\nraise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time\napplication that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as\n“second or successive.” This is consistent with pre-AEDPA\ncases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar\non “second or successive” applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo\nv. United States, 265 U. S. 239, 241 (1924) (second applica\ntion barred where petitioner had a “full opportunity to\noffer proof” of the same claim in his first habeas applica\ntion); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U. S. 377, 379 (1984)\n(Powell, J., concurring, writing for a majority of the Court)\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n(second application barred for claims that “could and\nshould have been raised in [the] first petition”); Delo v.\nStokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (subsequent\napplication barred for a claim that “could have been raised\nin his first petition for federal habeas corpus”). As\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, “a\npetitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub\nsequent petition that he could have raised in his first,\nregardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier\nstemmed from a deliberate choice.” See also Habeas Cor\npus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to “specify all\nthe grounds for relief available to [them]” and to “state the\nfacts supporting each ground”); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298, 317–323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,\nthrough legislation and judicial decision, of modified res\njudicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§4406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata doctrine bars “matters that [were not, but] ought\nto have been raised” in prior litigation).\n   Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise\nthe claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica\ntion raising that claim is not “second or successive,” and\n§2244(b)(2)’s bar does not apply. This can occur where the\nclaim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,\ne.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation\noccurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as\nthe State’s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required\nby state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898–\n899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v. Norris, 251 F. 3d 720, 723–725\n(CA8 2001); In re Cain, 137 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).\nAnd to respond to the Court’s concern, see ante, at 20, if\nthe applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he\nraised in his first petition but the District Court left unad\ndressed at its own discretion, the second application would\nnot be “second or successive.” Reraising a previously\n4                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the\nCourt believes there are “[m]any examples” where abuse\nof-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris\noners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would\nthink the Court would be able to come up with an exam\nple. It does not do so.\n   Third, a “mixed petition”—raising both abusive and\nnonabusive claims—would be “second or successive.” In\nthat circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain\nauthorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the\nnonabusive claims. See §2244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore\net al., Federal Practice §671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After\nthe court of appeals makes its determination, a district\ncourt may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner\nhad no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and\ndismiss the abusive claims. See §2244(b)(4).\n   The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the\nCourt’s decision in Panetti. Panetti’s claim that he was\nmentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain\nwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until\nafter the denial of his first habeas petition. When the\nFord claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas\npetition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con\ncluding that this second habeas petition was not a “second\nor successive” application, this Court explained that “sec\nond or successive” did not “refe[r] to all §2254 applications\nfiled second or successively in time,” but was rather a\nterm-of-art that “takes its full meaning from our case law,\nincluding decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].”\n551 U. S., at 943–944. The Court relied on AEDPA’s\npurpose of “ ‘further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,\nand federalism,’ ” id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the “empty\nformality requiring prisoners to file unripe” claims, 551\nU. S., at 946, and this Court’s pre-AEDPA cases regarding\nthe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nlooked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in\ntime habeas petition to determine that the application was\nnot “second or successive.” Ibid.\n  The above principles apply to a situation, like the pre\nsent one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceed\ning succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,\nwhich allows the state court to correct an error that oc\ncurred at the original sentencing. Assume, as alleged\nhere, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing\nproceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake\nthat also occurred at the first sentencing. The second\napplication is “second or successive” with respect to that\nclaim because the alleged error “could and should have”\nbeen raised in the first petition. Woodard, 464 U. S., at\n379 (opinion of Powell, J.). Put another way, under abuse\nof-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to chal\nlenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportu\nnity after his claim becomes ripe. On the other hand, if\nthe petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition\nthat could not have been raised in the earlier petition—\nperhaps because the error occurred for the first time dur\ning resentencing—then the application raising the claim is\nnot “second or successive” and §2244(b)(2)’s bar does not\napply.\n  Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to\nshow that the application in this case is “second or succes\nsive,” it must be noted that no previous case from this\nCourt has dealt with the precise sequence of events here:\nA petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim\nafter a second resentencing proceeding that followed a\ngrant of federal habeas relief. The conclusion that such an\napplication is barred as “second or successive” unless the\nclaim was previously unavailable is consistent with the\napproach of every court of appeals that has considered the\nissue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties\nthat are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.\n6                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nSee, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62–63 (CA1\n1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37–38 (CA2\n1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871\n(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351−353\n(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context\nof federal prisoners’ challenges to their convictions or\nsentences under 28 U. S. C. §2255, the “second or succes\nsive” bar under §2244(b) applies to §2255 motions. See\n§2255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).\n   In the present case the Court should conclude that\nMagwood has filed a “second or successive habeas corpus\napplication.” In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti\ntion raising nine claims, including that the trial court\nimproperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when\nit imposed Magwood’s death sentence. The District Court\ngranted Magwood’s petition and ordered relief only on the\nmitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a\nnew sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of\nthe mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.\nIn 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this\ntime raising an argument that could have been, but was\nnot, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he\nwas not eligible for the death penalty because he did not\nhave fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi\nble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have\nraised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.\nBecause Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju\ndicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in\n1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as\n“second or successive.”\n                             II\n  The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill\ndefined exception to the “second or successive” application\nbar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical\nerrors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti’s claim-based\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\napproach to determining whether an application is “second\nor successive.” Second, it imposes an atextual exception to\n§2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” applications,\nrequiring that the second-in-time application be brought\nagainst the same judgment. This second error is under\nscored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the\nlogical implications of its newly created rule.\n                              A\n   The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to\n“second or successive” applications rather than “second or\nsuccessive” claims, the nature of the claims raised in the\nsecond application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (“[A]l\nthough we agree with the State that many of the rules\nunder §2244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to\nrewrite the statute to make the phrase ‘second or succes\nsive’ modify claims as well”). This is incorrect. As ex\nplained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether\nan application itself is “second or successive” requires\nlooking to the nature of the claim that the application\nraises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and\nfair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.\nIndeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that\nthe application there was not “second or successive” was to\nlook at the underlying claim the application raised. 551\nU. S., at 947.\n   While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into\ndoubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to\nexplain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“Before\nAEDPA’s enactment, the phrase ‘second or successive’\nmeant the same thing it does today—any subsequent\nfederal habeas application challenging a state-court judg\nment”). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting\nits new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously\nunexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti\n8                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nto the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (“Today’s decision thus stands only for the\nproposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special\n(and unjustified) exemption from the statute’s plain\nimport”).\n   Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid\ning whether an application is barred as “second or succes\nsive” raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time\nhabeas petition challenging an alleged violation that\noccurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for\nexample, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time\npromised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of\ngood-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court’s\nrule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng\ning those alleged violations would be barred as “second or\nsuccessive” because it would be a second-in-time applica\ntion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.\nThat result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ\nprinciples and might work a suspension of the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\n                              B\n  Having unmoored the phrase “second or successive”\nfrom its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court\ncreates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is\nnot what makes an application “second or successive,”\nthen to what should a court look? Finding no reference\npoint in §2244(b)’s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for\na different peg.\n  The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different\nprovision:\n    “[A] district court shall entertain an application for a\n    writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody\n    pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the\n    ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti\n    tution or laws or treaties of the United States.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    §2254(a).\nBut this provision does not purport to create any prerequi\nsites to §2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” appli\ncations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is\nthat this is a mere “status requirement.” See 1 R. Hertz &\nJ. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce\ndure §8.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for\nthe simple proposition that a petitioner must be held\n“pursuant to the judgment of a State court” to be able to\nfile any §2254(b) petition in the first place. That reading\nalso explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not\nonly the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is\nbeing held but also “the duration of sentence . . . and . . .\nthe conditions under which that sentence is being served,”\nincluding rules such as “the basis of parole” and “good\ntime” credits. Id., §9.1, at 475–481.\n   The Court’s reading of the phrase “pursuant to the\njudgment of a State court” as a limitation on §2244(b)(2)’s\n“second or successive” application bar is artificial. The\nCourt would amend §2244(b)(2) to read: “A claim pre\nsented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\nunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior\napplication [against the same judgment] shall be dis\nmissed.” This is not what §2244(b)(2) says.\n   The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob\nlem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the\nnotion that “[a]n error made a second time is still a new\nerror.” Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the\nCourt can mean one of two very different things:\n   First, it could mean that any error logically encom\npassed in a reentered judgment is a “new” error. A crimi\nnal “judgment” generally includes both the conviction and\nthe sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a\ncriminal judgment “must set forth the plea, the jury ver\ndict or the court’s findings, the adjudication, and the\n10               MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsentence”); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)\n(“As we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily\nincludes the sentence imposed upon the defendant”). This\nwell-established principle applies in the federal habeas\ncontext, where petitioner is “in custody pursuant to the\njudgment.” §2254(b). A person cannot be held in custody\n“pursuant to” a sentence, but only pursuant to “the” (e.g.,\none) judgment, which includes both the conviction and\nsentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156–157\n(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA’s statute of\nlimitations did not run until the judgment—“both his\nconviction and sentence became final” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Under this principle, the Court’s holding today would\nallow a challenger in Magwood’s position to raise any\nchallenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment\nagainst him in his second application, since a “new” judg\nment—consisting of both the conviction and sentence—has\nnow been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)\noccurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court\nhere reentered the following judgment after resentencing:\n“IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY\nTHE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the\noffense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag\nwood is sentenced to death.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.\nThis would mean that Magwood’s attorney could dig\nthrough anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross\nexamination of witnesses to the jury’s guilty verdict, and\nraise any alleged errors for the first time in his second\nhabeas application, all because the trial court did not\nproperly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood’s\nfirst sentencing proceeding.\n   Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even\nfurther from the statutory text and conclude that only\nsome parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal\nlenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfor example, argues that he can only challenge previously\nunraised errors made during sentencing. Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, n. 8. Indeed, Magwood goes further and sug\ngests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a\ncase where a court’s order leads the trial court to revise\nonly the defendant’s term of supervised release. Id., at 28,\nn. 11. If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the\ncriminal-judgment exception to the “second or successive”\napplication bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood\nnow raises is a “new error” at all. After all, Magwood did\nnot challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas peti\ntion but only disputed that he should not get the death\npenalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court prop\nerly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.\nThe state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no\nreason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Mag\nwood is death eligible. It is hard to see how the trial\ncourt’s failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous death\neligibility finding is a “new error,” any more than its fail\nure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken\nplace at the guilt phase would have been new errors.\n   The Court contends the approach dictated by Panetti\n“considerably undermine[s]—if not render[s] superfluous,”\nante, at 14, the exceptions in §2244(b)(2), which allow a\npetitioner to bring a claim in a “second or successive”\napplication based on certain factual discoveries or based\non a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied\nretroactively. The Court seems to be saying that applying\nPanetti’s rule would make the exceptions superfluous,\nbecause any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would\nnecessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the\nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. But the Court misconceives\nthe scope of the rule that an application is only “second or\nsuccessive” if it raises for the first time a claim that could\nhave been raised before. A second petition raising a claim\nthat could have been raised in a prior petition, even\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthough strengthened by a new decision from this Court or\nbased upon newly discovered evidence, is still “second or\nsuccessive.” Thus this subsequent application would only\nbe permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection\n(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court’s approach that\nlimits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.\nUnder the Court’s theory, the “second or successive” bar\ndoes not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in\nMagwood’s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep\ntions would have no operation in that context.\n                               III\n   The Court’s approach disregards AEDPA’s “ ‘principles\nof comity, finality, and federalism.’ ” Panetti, 551 U. S., at\n945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the\nCourt’s newly created exception to the “second or succes\nsive” application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even\nthe most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc\ning would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims\nin his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he\nfailed to raise in his first petition. “[I]f reexamination of\n[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal\nism and comity, the offense increases when a State must\ndefend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas\nproceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti\ntion.” McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.\n   The Court’s novel exception would also allow the once\nsuccessful petitioner to reraise every argument against a\nsentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the\nfirst round of federal habeas review. As respondents\nexplain, under the Court’s theory, “a post-resentencing\npetitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the\nwords, ‘§2254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,’ to his\npreviously adjudicated petition.” Brief for Respondents\n47. Because traditional res judicata principles do not\napply to federal habeas proceedings, see Salinger v. Loisel,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924), this would force federal courts\nto address twice (or thrice, or more) the same claims of\nerror. The State and the victims would have to bear anew\nthe “ significant costs of federal habeas corpus review,”\nMcCleskey, supra, at 490–491, all because the petitioner\npreviously succeeded on a wholly different, discrete, and\npossibly unrelated claim.\n   The Court’s suggestion that “[i]t will not take a court\nlong to dispose of such claims where the court has already\nanalyzed the legal issues,” ante, at 20, n. 15, misses the\npoint. This reassurance will be cold comfort to overworked\nstate district attorneys, who will now have to waste time\nand resources writing briefs analyzing dozens of claims\nthat should be barred by abuse-of-the-writ principles. It is\ndifficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals\nto do their best work, day after day, when they have to\ndeal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously\nrejected or otherwise abusive claims. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court is mandating, under a statute that was\ndesigned to require just the opposite result. If the analy\nsis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States\nwill document the ill effects of the Court’s opinion so that\nits costs and deficiencies are better understood if this\nissue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.\n   The Court’s new exception will apply not only to death\npenalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised\nclaim appears arguably meritorious. It will apply to all\nfederal habeas petitions following a prior successful peti\ntion, most of which will not be in death cases and where\nthe abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack\nmerit. And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court’s\ndecision means that States subject to federal habeas re\nview henceforth receive less recognition of a finality inter\nest than the Federal Government does on direct review of\nfederal criminal convictions. See United States v. Parker,\n101 F. 3d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (“A party\n14                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second\nappeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in\nthe first appeal because the remand did not affect it”).\n   The Court’s approach also turns AEDPA’s bar against\n“second or successive” applications into a one-way ratchet\nthat favors habeas petitioners. Unless today’s decision is\nread to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7–8, AEDPA\nstill incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of\nthe-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ\nously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But after today’s holding, AEDPA now “modi\nfie[s],” ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows\npetitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have\nwon any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti\ntion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new\nloophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge\ntheir sentences based on grounds they previously ne\nglected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand\ning that AEDPA adds “new restrictions on successive\npetitions” and “further restricts the availability of relief to\nhabeas petitioners.” Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664\n(1996).\n                        *    *     *\n  Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all\nagree that claims then available, but not raised, would be\nbarred.
