PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u2013158.      Argued March 24, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder. After the Ala\n  bama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction pro\n  ceedings, he sought federal habeas relief. The District Court condi\n  tionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be\n  released or resentenced. The state trial court sentenced him to death\n  a second time. He filed another federal habeas application, challeng\n  ing this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warn\n  ing at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death\n  sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffec\n  tive assistance during the resentencing proceeding. The District\n  Court once again conditionally granted the writ. The Eleventh Cir\n  cuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\u2019s challenge to\n  his new death sentence was an unreviewable \u201csecond or successive\u201d\n  challenge under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b) because he could have raised his\n  fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n555 F. 3d 968, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV\u2013B, concluding that because Magwood\u2019s habeas application\n  challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not \u201csecond or suc\n  cessive\u201d under \u00a72244(b). Pp. 8\u201315, 17\u201322.\n    (a) This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a\n  \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus application.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1), (2).\n  The State contends that \u00a72244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to\n  bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present. Under\n  this \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, Magwood\u2019s fair-warning claim was \u201csec\n2                       MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ond and successive\u201d because he had an opportunity to raise it in his\n    first application but did not. Magwood counters that \u00a72244(b) should\n    not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment interven\n    ing between habeas applications. This Court agrees. The phrase\n    \u201csecond or successive\u201d is not defined by AEDPA and it is a \u201cterm of\n    art.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486. To determine its mean\n    ing, the Court looks first to the statutory context. Section 2244(b)\u2019s\n    limitations apply only to a \u201chabeas corpus application under \u00a72254,\u201d\n    i.e., an application on \u201cbehalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n    judgment of a State court,\u201d \u00a72254(b)(1). Both \u00a72254(b)\u2019s text and the\n    relief it provides indicate that \u201csecond or successive\u201d must be inter\n    preted with respect to the judgment challenged. A \u00a72254 petitioner\n    \u201cseeks invalidation . . . of the judgment authorizing [his] confine\n    ment,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83. If a conditional writ is\n    granted, \u201cthe State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or\n    a new sentencing proceeding).\u201d Ibid. The State errs in contending\n    that, if \u00a72254 is relevant at all, \u201ccustody\u201d and not \u201cjudgment,\u201d is the\n    proper reference because unlawful \u201ccustody\u201d is the \u201csubstance\u201d re\n    quirement for habeas relief. This argument is unpersuasive. Section\n    2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under\n    \u00a72254. Because \u00a72254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state\n    court judgment, that \u201cjudgment\u201d is inextricable and essential to re\n    lief. It is a requirement that distinguishes \u00a72254 from other statutes\n    permitting constitutional relief. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a72255, 2241. The State\u2019s\n    \u201ccustody\u201d-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying \u201csec\n    ond or successive\u201d to any subsequent application filed before a pris\n    oner\u2019s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous\n    custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy \u00a72244(b)\u2019s strict rules to\n    challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\n    statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result. Pp. 8\u2013\n    13.\n       (b) This Court is also not convinced by the State\u2019s argument that a\n    \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule would be consistent with the statute and\n    should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA\u2019s purpose of pre\n    venting piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship. AEDPA uses \u201csec\n    ond or successive\u201d to modify \u201capplication,\u201d not \u201cclaim\u201d as the State\n    contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of\n    \u00a72244(b) that would \u201celid[e] the difference between an \u2018application\u2019\n    and a \u2018claim,\u2019 \u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9. The State\u2019s reading\n    also reflects a more fundamental error. It would undermine or ren\n    der superfluous much of \u00a72244(b)(2). In some circumstances, it would\n    increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of\n    the-writ rules where \u00a72244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions. In others, it\n    would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where \u00a72244(b) mandates stricter\n  requirements. Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (c) This Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72244(b) is consistent with its\n  precedents. Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State in\n  vokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies \u201csecond\n  or successive\u201d to an application challenging a new judgment, these\n  cases shed no light on the question presented here. Nor do post-\n  AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here. Only Burton v.\n  Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold ques\n  tion whether an application is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it challenges a\n  new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new\n  judgment is dispositive. In holding that both of the petitioner\u2019s ha\n  beas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Bur\n  ton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment inter\n  vening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been\n  different. Here, there is such an intervening judgment. This is Mag\n  wood\u2019s first application challenging that intervening judgment.\n  Magwood challenges not the trial court\u2019s error in his first sentencing,\n  but the court\u2019s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and\n  reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. Pp. 15, 17\u201321.\n     (d) Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underly\n  ing conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State\u2019s objec\n  tion that this reading of \u00a72244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a\n  conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application\n  challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\n  undisturbed conviction. Nor does the Court address whether Mag\n  wood\u2019s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the\n  Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n  counsel claim.

TONY\n\n           PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Part IV\u2013B.\n  Petitioner Billy Joe Magwood was sentenced to death for\nmurdering a sheriff. After the Alabama courts denied\nrelief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings,\nMagwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus\nin Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction\nand his sentence. The District Court conditionally granted\nthe writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood\neither be released or resentenced. The state trial court\nconducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced\nMagwood to death. Magwood filed an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new\nsentence. The District Court once again conditionally\ngranted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new\nsentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nreversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\u2019s chal\nlenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d challenge under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(b) because he could have mounted the same chal\nlenge to his original death sentence. We granted certio\n2                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrari, and now reverse. Because Magwood\u2019s habeas appli\ncation1 challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is\nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a72244(b).\n                             I\n   After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served\nseveral years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama,\nunder the watch of Sheriff C. F. \u201cNeil\u201d Grantham. During\nhis incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of\nmental illness, became convinced that Grantham had\nimprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even\nupon his release. Magwood followed through on his\nthreat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his\nrelease, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sher\niff\u2019s arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood\nshot him and fled the scene.\n   Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of\nan on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code\n\u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5) (1975).2 He was tried in 1981. The prose\ncution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggra\nvated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought\nthe death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason\nof insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital\nmurder under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of\ndeath based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Although 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b) refers to a habeas \u201capplication,\u201d we\n\nuse the word \u201cpetition\u201d interchangeably with the word \u201capplication,\u201d as\nwe have in our prior cases.\n   2 At the time of the murder, Alabama Code \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a) provided: \u201cIf\n\nthe jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death\nwhen the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following\noffenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the\nindictment . . . .\u201d The offenses included \u201cmurder of any . . . sheriff . . .\nwhile . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.\u201d \u00a713\u2013\n11\u20132(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of \u201caggravating circum\nstances,\u201d \u00a713\u201311\u20136, but the trial court found that none existed in\nMagwood\u2019s case.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nIn accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed\nthe basis for the jury\u2019s decision. See \u00a7\u00a713\u201311\u20133, 13\u201311\u20134.\nAlthough the court did not find the existence of any statu\ntory \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d under \u00a713\u201311\u20136, the\ncourt relied on Ex parte Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330 (Ala. 1981),\nto find that murder of a sheriff while \u201con duty or because\nof some official or job-related acts,\u201d \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5), is a\ncapital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation\nsufficient for a death sentence.3 The trial court found that\nMagwood\u2019s young age (27 at the time of the offense) and\nlack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating\nfactors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood\u2019s\nmental state. Weighing the aggravation against the two\nmitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of\ndeath. The Alabama courts affirmed. See Magwood v.\nState, 426 So. 2d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Ex parte\nMagwood, 426 So. 2d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983). We denied\ncertiorari. Magwood v. Alabama, 462 U. S. 1124 (1983).\nAfter the Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 As relevant here, Kyzer did away with the prior Alabama rule that\n\nan aggravating component of a capital felony could not double as an\naggravating factor supporting a capital sentence. In Kyzer, the defen\ndant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of \u201ctwo or\nmore human beings\u201d under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.\nThe crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,\njust as Magwood\u2019s crime of murder, as defined under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5),\nwas aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of\nthe sheriff\u2019s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court\nultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower\ncourt on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged\ncrime, see \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death\neven without a finding of any \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d enumerated\nin \u00a713\u201311\u20136. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was\nconvicted under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10), \u201cthe jury and the trial judge at the\nsentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict\nment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is\nnot listed in \u00a713\u201311\u20136 as an aggravating circumstance.\u201d Id., at 339\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n4                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nJuly 22, 1983, Magwood filed a coram nobis petition and\nan application for a stay of execution. The trial court held\na hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18,\n1983.4\n   Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood\nfiled an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254, and the District Court granted a stay of\nexecution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court\nupheld Magwood\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and\nconditionally granted the writ based on the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating\nto Magwood\u2019s mental state.5 See Magwood v. Smith, 608\nF. Supp. 218, 225\u2013226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985). The Court of\nAppeals affirmed. See Magwood v. Smith, 791 F. 2d 1438,\n1450 (CA11 1986).\n   In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court\nheld a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.\nThis time, the judge found that Magwood\u2019s mental state,\nas well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as\nstatutory mitigating circumstances. As before, the court\nfound that Magwood\u2019s capital felony under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5)\nincluded sufficient aggravation to render him death eligi\nble. In his proposed findings, Magwood\u2019s attorney agreed\nthat Magwood\u2019s offense rendered him death eligible, but\nargued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in\nlight of the mitigating factors. The trial court imposed a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 The  Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently affirmed the\ndenial of Magwood\u2019s coram nobis petition, see Magwood v. State, 449\nSo. 2d 1267 (1984), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied Magwood\u2019s\nmotion to file an out-of-time appeal from that decision, see Ex parte\nMagwood, 453 So. 2d 1349 (1984).\n    5 See Ala. Code \u00a713\u201311\u20137 (\u201cMitigating circumstances shall be the\n\nfollowing: . . . (2) The capital felony was committed while the defendant\nwas under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\n. . . . (6) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of\nhis conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was\nsubstantially impaired\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

App. 1988); Ex parte Magwood,\n548 So. 2d 516, 516 (Ala. 1988), and this Court denied\ncertiorari, see Magwood v. Alabama, 493 U. S. 923 (1989).\n   Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama\u2019s\nformer Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987)\n(now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming,\ninter alia, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum\nsentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence\nviolated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nbecause it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of\nthe capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney ren\ndered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentenc\ning. The trial court denied relief. It held that the statu\ntory basis for Magwood\u2019s death sentence had been\naffirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The\ntrial court also held that Magwood\u2019s attorney played no\nsubstantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation\nto dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court\nhad required only that the trial court consider additional\nmitigating factors.\n   Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition,\narguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional\nbecause he did not have fair warning that his offense could\nbe punished by death, and that he received constitution\nally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing.

App.), Tab 25,\npp. 23\u201324, 53\u201361.\n   The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, citing\nits decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the\ndeath sentence. See Magwood v.

S.\n836 (1997).\n   In April 1997, Magwood sought leave to file a second or\nsuccessive application for a writ of habeas corpus challeng\ning his 1981 judgment of conviction. See \u00a72244(b)(3)(A)\n(requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a\nsecond or successive application). The Court of Appeals\ndenied his request. See In re Magwood, 113 F. 3d 1544\n(CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,\nwhich the District Court conditionally granted. See Mag\nwood v. Culliver, 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala.\n2007). In that petition, Magwood again argued that his\nsentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair\nwarning at the time of his offense that his conduct would\nbe sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama\nlaw, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance\nduring the resentencing proceeding.\n   Before addressing the merits of Magwood\u2019s fair-warning\nclaim, the District Court sua sponte considered whether\nthe application was barred as a \u201csuccessive petition\u201d under\n\u00a72244, and concluded that it was not.

See 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285\u20131286; supra,\nat 5. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that\nMagwood\u2019s death sentence was unconstitutional because\n\u201cat the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have\nfair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at\nleast one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former\n1975 Ala. Code \u00a713\u201311\u20136.\u201d 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The\nDistrict Court also found the state court\u2019s grounds for\nrejecting Magwood\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim unrea\nsonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting\nthat Magwood\u2019s attorney in fact had engaged substan\ntively in the \u201ccomplete and new\u201d resentencing, and al\nthough the attorney could not be expected to object on\nstate-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly\nineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning\nclaim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 555\nF. 3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in\ndetermining whether \u00a72244(b) applies is to \u201cseparate the\nnew claims challenging the resentencing from the old\nclaims that were or should have been presented in the\nprior application.\u201d Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).

Id., at 975\u2013976. The\nCourt of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Mag\nwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the\nexceptions to \u00a72244(b)\u2019s general rule requiring dismissal of\nclaims first presented in a successive application.7 See id.,\nat 976.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood\u2019s\napplication challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed\nas part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ\nfrom the District Court, is subject to the constraints that\n\u00a72244(b) imposes on the review of \u201csecond or successive\u201d\nhabeas applications. 558 U.

More specifically, it turns on\nwhen a claim should be deemed to arise in a \u201csecond or\nsuccessive habeas corpus application.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1), (2).\nIf an application is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d the petitioner\nmust obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing\nit with the district court. See \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The district\ncourt must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized\nsecond or successive application unless the applicant\nshows that the claim satisfies certain statutory require\nments. See \u00a72244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood\u2019s application\nwas \u201csecond or successive,\u201d the District Court should have\ndismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the\nrequisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If,\nhowever, Magwood\u2019s application was not second or succes\nsive, it was not subject to \u00a72244(b) at all, and his fair\nwarning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).\n   The State contends that although \u00a72244(b), as amended\nby AEDPA, applies the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to\n\u201capplication[s],\u201d it \u201cis a claim-focused statute,\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 22\u201324, and \u201c[c]laims, not applications, are\nbarred by \u00a72244(b),\u201d id., at 24 (citing Artuz v.

According to the State, the phrase\nshould be read to reflect a principle that \u201ca prisoner is\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to\nwage a collateral attack.\u201d See Brief for Respondents\n25\u201326 (citing Beyer v.

The State\nasserts that under this \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, Magwood\u2019s\nfair-warning claim was successive because he had an\nopportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not\ndo so. See Brief for Respondents 25\u201326.\n   Magwood, in contrast, reads \u00a72244(b) to apply only to a\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application challenging the same\nstate-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986\nresentencing led to a new judgment, and his first applica\ntion challenging that new judgment cannot be \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d such that \u00a72244(b) would apply. We agree.\n   We begin with the text.

To determine its meaning, we\nlook first to the statutory context. The limitations im\nposed by \u00a72244(b) apply only to a \u201chabeas corpus applica\ntion under \u00a72254,\u201d that is, an \u201capplication for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court,\u201d \u00a72254(b)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The reference to a state-court judgment in\n\u00a72254(b) is significant because the term \u201capplication\u201d\ncannot be defined in a vacuum. A \u00a72254 petitioner is\napplying for something: His petition \u201cseeks invalidation\n(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris\noner\u2019s confinement,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83\n(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis\ntrict court\u2019s granting of the writ, \u201cthe State may seek a\nnew judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing\nproceeding).\u201d Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both\n\u00a72254(b)\u2019s text and the relief it provides indicate that the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d must be interpreted with\nrespect to the judgment challenged.\n   The State disagrees, contending that if the cross\nreference to \u00a72254 is relevant, we should focus not on the\nstatute\u2019s reference to a \u201cjudgment\u201d but on its reference to\n\u201ccustody,\u201d Brief for Respondents 53; compare \u00a7\u00a72254(a),\n(b) (establishing rules for review of \u201can application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus\u201d on \u201cbehalf of a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d (emphasis\nadded)) with \u00a72254(a) (specifying that an application may\nbe entertained \u201conly on the ground that [the petitioner] is\nin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea\nties of the United States\u201d (emphasis added)). The State\nexplains that unlawful \u201ccustody\u201d is the key \u201c \u2018substance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nAEDPA.\u201d 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-\n\nAEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question\n\npresented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13. \n\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement\u2019 \u201d of \u00a72254, whereas being held pursuant to a\nstate-court \u201cjudgment\u201d is merely a \u201c \u2018status requirement.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman & Hertz,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a78.1,\np. 391).\n   We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254\narticulates the kind of confinement that may be chal\nlenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held \u201cin\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a72254(a). The requirement of custody\npursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes \u00a72254\nfrom other statutory provisions authorizing relief from\nconstitutional violations\u2014such as \u00a72255, which allows\nchallenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983, which allows federal-court suits against\nstate and local officials. Custody is crucial for \u00a72254\npurposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that\nauthorizes it.\n   The State\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d-based rule is difficult to justify for\nanother reason. Under the State\u2019s approach, applying the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to any subsequent applica\ntion filed before a prisoner\u2019s release would mean that a\nprisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com\npletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the\nstrict rules for review under \u00a72244(b) to challenge his\nunrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\nstatutory text or context supports, much less requires,\nsuch an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at\n507 (\u201c[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral\nattack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of\nimprisonment\u201d); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85 (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (\u201c[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one\nof several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate\nthe challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

According to the State, a\n\u201cone opportunity\u201d rule is consistent with the statutory\ntext, and better reflects AEDPA\u2019s purpose of preventing\npiecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.\n   We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase \u201csecond\nor successive\u201d to modify \u201capplication.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1),\n(2). The State reads the phrase to modify \u201cclaims.\u201d See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (\u201cCongress\u2019 intent for\nAEDPA was to eradicate successive claims\u201d). We cannot\nreplace the actual text with speculation as to Congress\u2019\nintent. We have previously found Congress\u2019 use of the\nword \u201capplication\u201d significant, and have refused to adopt\nan interpretation of \u00a72244(b) that would \u201celid[e] the differ\nence between an \u2018application\u2019 and a \u2018claim,\u2019 \u201d Artuz, 531\nU. S., at 9; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 530\n(2005) (\u201c[F]or purposes of \u00a72244(b), an \u2018application\u2019 for\nhabeas relief is a filing that contains one or more\n\u2018claims\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, although we agree with the State\nthat many of the rules under \u00a72244(b) focus on claims,\nthat does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d modify claims as well.10\n   The State\u2019s reading leads to a second, more fundamental\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements.\n\nSee Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to \u201cask for relief\nfrom the state-court judgment being contested\u201d); Rule 2(e) (prescribing\nthat any \u201cpetitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one\nstate court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or\njudgments of each court\u201d).\n   10 The dissent recognizes that the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d ap\n\nplies to an application as a whole, see post, at 2\u20134 (opinion of KENNEDY,\nJ.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see\ninfra, at 14\u201315.\n14                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nerror. Under the State\u2019s \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d would apply to any claim\nthat the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise\nin a prior application. And the phrase \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not\nhave a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.\n   This reading of \u00a72244(b) would considerably under\nmine\u2014if not render superfluous\u2014the exceptions to dis\nmissal set forth in \u00a72244(b)(2). That section describes\ncircumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be\nconsidered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly\ndiscovered facts suggesting \u201cthat . . . no reasonable fact\nfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the under\nlying offense.\u201d \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,\na petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity\nto raise the claim, so under the State\u2019s rule the claim\nwould not be successive and \u00a72244(b)(2) would not apply to\nit at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised\nin a second application challenging the same judgment.11\n   In addition to duplicating the exceptions under \u00a72244(b)\nin some circumstances, the State\u2019s rule would dilute them\nin others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact\nbased claims not presented in a prior application applies\nonly if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 This case does not require us to determine whether \u00a72244(b) ap\n\nplies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a\nstate-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court\njudgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,\n523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945\n(2007).\n  The dissent\u2019s claim that our reading of \u00a72244(b) calls one of those\ndecisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 7\u20138, is unfounded. The\nquestion in this case is whether a first application challenging a new\nsentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive.

We decline to adopt a reading that\nwould thus truncate \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s requirements.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that\nthe approach we take here contradicts our precedents.\nThe State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying\nreview of claims in second or successive applications\nwhere the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior\nopportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.\nUnited States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465\nU. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464\nU. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320\n(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467\n(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag\nwood\u2019s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second\nor successive because he could have raised\u2014but did not\nraise\u2014the claim in his first application.\n   But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to an application challenging\na new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on\nthe question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the\nwrit rules, as modified by AEDPA under \u00a72244(b)(2), apply\nat all to an application challenging a new judgment. The\nState\u2019s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its\nfailure to distinguish between \u00a72244(b)\u2019s threshold inquiry\ninto whether an application is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d and\nits subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive\napplication must be dismissed.\n16                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d by reference to our longstanding\ndoctrine governing abuse of the writ. AEDPA modifies\nthose abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statu\ntory rules under \u00a72244(b). These rules apply only to \u201csec\nond or successive\u201d applications. The dissent contends that\nthis reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range\nof abusive claims that would have been barred under prior\nrules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this\nCourt has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the\npetitioner raised it in an application challenging a new\njudgment.\n   The dissent\u2019s conclusion that our reading of \u00a72254 \u201cun\nmoor[s] the phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 from its textual\nand historical underpinnings,\u201d post, at 8, is unwarranted.\nPre-AEDPA usage of the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is\nconsistent with our reading. A review of our habeas\nprecedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirma\ntively define the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d as it ap\npears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to applications filed by state prison\ners until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose\nin the federal context, see \u00a72255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and\napplied only to applications raising previously adjudicated\nclaims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 12\n(1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit\ndismissal of \u201cabusive\u201d claims\u2014as distinguished from\n\u201csuccessive\u201d claims, see ibid.\u2014Congress codified restric\ntions on both types of claims in \u00a72244(b), but still without\nusing the phrase \u201csecond or successive.\u201d See \u00a72244(b)\n(1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applica\ntions filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not\nuntil 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d into \u00a72244(b). In light of this complex history\nof the phrase \u201csecond or successive,\u201d we must rely upon\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe current text to determine when the phrase applies,\nrather than pre-AEDPA precedents or superseded statu\ntory formulations.12\n                             C\n   Nor do our post-AEDPA cases contradict our approach.\nOnly one, Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147 (2007) (per\ncuriam), comes close to addressing the threshold question\nwhether an application is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it chal\nlenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the\nexistence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the\npetitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court\nin 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen\ntencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.\nId., at 150. The state appellate court affirmed the convic\ntion but remanded for a second resentencing. Ibid. In\nMarch 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment\nand new sentence. Id., at 151. In December 1998, with\nstate review of his new sentence still pending, the peti\ntioner filed a \u00a72254 application challenging his 1994 con\nviction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.\n   In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,\nthe petitioner filed a \u00a72254 petition challenging only his\n1998 sentence. The District Court denied relief on the\nmerits and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,\nholding that the petition challenging the sentence should\nhave been dismissed as an unauthorized \u201csecond or suc\ncessive\u201d application. Id., at 153; see \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). We\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent speculates about issues far beyond the question before\n\nthe Court. See, e.g., post, at 8\u20139 (suggesting that our judgment-based\nreading of \u00a72244(b) calls into question precedents recognizing habeas\npetitions challenging the denial of good-time credits or parole). We\naddress only an application challenging a new state-court judgment for\nthe first time. We do not purport to constrain the scope of \u00a72254 as we\nhave previously defined it.\n18                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected the petitioner\u2019s argument \u201cthat his 1998 and 2002\npetitions challenged different judgments.\u201d Id., at 155; see\nid., at 156\u2013157. Although petitioner had styled his first\npetition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his\nsecond petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we\nconcluded that both attacked the same \u201cjudgment\u201d be\ncause the 1998 sentence was already in place when the\npetitioner filed his first application for federal habeas\nrelief. See id., at 156. In other words, the judgment he\nchallenged in his 1998 application was \u201cthe same one\nchallenged in the subsequent 2002 petition\u201d; it \u201cwas the\njudgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being\ndetained.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recog\nnized that the case might have been different had there\nbeen a \u201cnew judgment intervening between the two ha\nbeas petitions.\u201d Ibid. There was no such judgment in\nBurton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.\n   This is Magwood\u2019s first application challenging that\nintervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is\nobvious to us\u2014and the State does not dispute\u2014that his\nclaim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon\nnew errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning\nclaim does not, because the state court made the same\nmistake before. We disagree. An error made a second\ntime is still a new error. That is especially clear here,\nwhere the state court conducted a full resentencing and\nreviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. See Sentencing\nTr., R. Tab 1, at R\u201325 (\u201cThe Court in f[or]mulating the\npresent judgment has considered the original record of the\ntrial and sentence. . . .

A petitioner may not raise\nin federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in\nstate court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the\nerror. If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural re\nquirements for bringing an error to the state court\u2019s atten\ntion\u2014whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings,\nas state law may require\u2014procedural default will bar\nfederal review. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n729\u2013730 (1991); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 848\n(1999) (stating that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to present\nthree of his federal habeas claims to the [state court] in a\ntimely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of\nthose claims\u201d). In this case, the State argued that Mag\nwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by\nfailing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the\n1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground.\nOnly after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally\ndefault the claim did the District Court sua sponte con\nsider whether \u00a72244(b) barred review.14 We leave that\nprocedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review\nin the first instance. Here, we underscore only that proce\ndural-default rules continue to constrain review of claims\nin all applications, whether the applications are \u201csecond or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[the petitioner] is attempting to challenge the constitutionality of a\nproceeding which obviously occurred after he filed, and obtained relief,\nin his first habeas petition\u201d).\n  14 See 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1267 (MD Ala. 2007) (\u201cThis court split\n\nthe proceedings on the current petition into two stages: Stage I (deter\nmining whether the claims were procedurally defaulted) and Stage II\n(considering the merits of the claims that were not procedurally de\nfaulted)\u201d). Few of Magwood\u2019s claims survived the initial cut.\n20                    MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuccessive\u201d or not.15\n   Ironically, in an effort to effectuate what they believe is\nCongress\u2019 intent not to give any unfair benefit to habeas\npetitioners, the State and the dissent propose an alterna\ntive rule that would \u201cclose our doors to a class of habeas\npetitioners seeking review without any clear indication\nthat such was Congress\u2019 intent.\u201d Castro v. United States,\n540 U. S. 375, 381 (2003). Many examples can be given,\nbut one suffices to illustrate this point. Suppose that a\npetitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious\nclaims challenging his conviction. The district court\ngrants a conditional writ based on one of them, without\nreaching the remaining nine. Upon retrial, the state court\ncommits the same 10 legal mistakes. (These are new\nerrors, but no more new than the sentencing error in\nMagwood\u2019s case.) Is an application presenting those same\n10 claims\u2014now based on the errors in the new judg\nment\u2014\u201csecond or successive\u201d? Under the opportunity\nbased rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the\nanswer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dis\nmissed. See \u00a72244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim\npresented in a prior application). The State attempts to\navoid this \u201cprocedural anomal[y],\u201d Castro, supra, at 380,\nby suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims\nas part of a first application, because they were never\nadjudicated on the merits. Cf. Slack, 529 U. S., at\n478\u2013481; Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 643\u2013645. As for\nthe adjudicated claim, \u201c[r]espondents assume that state\njudges will follow instructions imposed by federal courts,\u201d\nand if not, \u201cthat federal courts will consider a petitioner\u2019s\nclaim that the state court violated due process by failing to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The dissent\u2019s concern that such a petitioner may \u201creraise every\n\nargument against a sentence that was rejected by the federal courts\nduring the first round of federal habeas review,\u201d post, at 12, is similarly\nhyperbolic. It will not take a court long to dispose of such claims where\nthe court has already analyzed the legal issues.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

We see no need to engage in such novel and complex\nrationalizations.    AEDPA\u2019s text commands a more\nstraightforward rule: where, unlike in Burton, there is a\n\u201cnew judgment intervening between the two habeas peti\ntions,\u201d 549 U. S., at 156, an application challenging the\nresulting new judgment is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d at all.\n                            V\n   The State objects that our reading of \u00a72244(b) would\nallow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his\nsentence to file a subsequent application challenging not\nonly his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\nundisturbed conviction. The State believes this result\nfollows because a sentence and conviction form a single\n\u201cjudgment\u201d for purposes of habeas review. This case gives\nus no occasion to address that question, because Magwood\nhas not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16\nWe base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not\naltered by consequences the State speculates will follow in\nanother case.17\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood\u2019s first\napplication challenging his new sentence under the 1986\njudgment is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a72244(b).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Several Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds\non a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the\n\u201cportion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful\naction.\u201d Lang v.

The Court, in my\nrespectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misread\ning precedents on the meaning of the phrase \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The Court then rewrites\nAEDPA\u2019s text but refuses to grapple with the logical con\nsequences of its own editorial judgment. A straightfor\nward application of the principles articulated in Panetti v.\nQuarterman, 551 U. S. 930 (2007), consistent with the\nconclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have con\nsidered this issue, dictates the opposite result. The design\nand purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of\nhabeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ\u2019s\nintrusive effect on state criminal justice systems. But\ntoday\u2019s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step\nback from AEDPA protection for States but also a step\nback even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in\nplace before AEDPA.

S. C. \u00a72244(b)(2).\nThe question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy\nJoe Magwood filed \u201ca second or successive\u201d application by\nraising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had\navailable and yet failed to raise in his first petition.\n   The term \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a habeas \u201cterm of\nart.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It\nincorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi\nple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to\ndetermine whether an application is \u201csecond or succes\nsive,\u201d a court must look to the substance of the claim the\napplication raises and decide whether the petitioner had a\nfull and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior\napplication. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this\nanalytical framework puts applications into one of three\ncategories.\n   First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to\nraise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time\napplication that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as\n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d This is consistent with pre-AEDPA\ncases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar\non \u201csecond or successive\u201d applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo\nv. United States, 265 U. S. 239, 241 (1924) (second applica\ntion barred where petitioner had a \u201cfull opportunity to\noffer proof\u201d of the same claim in his first habeas applica\ntion); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.

S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (subsequent\napplication barred for a claim that \u201ccould have been raised\nin his first petition for federal habeas corpus\u201d). As\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, \u201ca\npetitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub\nsequent petition that he could have raised in his first,\nregardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier\nstemmed from a deliberate choice.\u201d See also Habeas Cor\npus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to \u201cspecify all\nthe grounds for relief available to [them]\u201d and to \u201cstate the\nfacts supporting each ground\u201d); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298, 317\u2013323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,\nthrough legislation and judicial decision, of modified res\njudicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata doctrine bars \u201cmatters that [were not, but] ought\nto have been raised\u201d in prior litigation).\n   Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise\nthe claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica\ntion raising that claim is not \u201csecond or successive,\u201d and\n\u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s bar does not apply. This can occur where the\nclaim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,\ne.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation\noccurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as\nthe State\u2019s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required\nby state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898\u2013\n899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v. Norris, 251 F. 3d 720, 723\u2013725\n(CA8 2001); In re Cain, 137 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).\nAnd to respond to the Court\u2019s concern, see ante, at 20, if\nthe applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he\nraised in his first petition but the District Court left unad\ndressed at its own discretion, the second application would\nnot be \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Reraising a previously\n4                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the\nCourt believes there are \u201c[m]any examples\u201d where abuse\nof-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris\noners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would\nthink the Court would be able to come up with an exam\nple. It does not do so.\n   Third, a \u201cmixed petition\u201d\u2014raising both abusive and\nnonabusive claims\u2014would be \u201csecond or successive.\u201d In\nthat circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain\nauthorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the\nnonabusive claims. See \u00a72244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore\net al., Federal Practice \u00a7671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After\nthe court of appeals makes its determination, a district\ncourt may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner\nhad no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and\ndismiss the abusive claims. See \u00a72244(b)(4).\n   The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Panetti. Panetti\u2019s claim that he was\nmentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain\nwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until\nafter the denial of his first habeas petition. When the\nFord claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas\npetition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con\ncluding that this second habeas petition was not a \u201csecond\nor successive\u201d application, this Court explained that \u201csec\nond or successive\u201d did not \u201crefe[r] to all \u00a72254 applications\nfiled second or successively in time,\u201d but was rather a\nterm-of-art that \u201ctakes its full meaning from our case law,\nincluding decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].\u201d\n551 U. S., at 943\u2013944. The Court relied on AEDPA\u2019s\npurpose of \u201c \u2018further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,\nand federalism,\u2019 \u201d id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the \u201cempty\nformality requiring prisoners to file unripe\u201d claims, 551\nU. S., at 946, and this Court\u2019s pre-AEDPA cases regarding\nthe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nlooked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in\ntime habeas petition to determine that the application was\nnot \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Ibid.\n  The above principles apply to a situation, like the pre\nsent one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceed\ning succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,\nwhich allows the state court to correct an error that oc\ncurred at the original sentencing. Assume, as alleged\nhere, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing\nproceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake\nthat also occurred at the first sentencing. The second\napplication is \u201csecond or successive\u201d with respect to that\nclaim because the alleged error \u201ccould and should have\u201d\nbeen raised in the first petition. Woodard, 464 U. S., at\n379 (opinion of Powell, J.). Put another way, under abuse\nof-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to chal\nlenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportu\nnity after his claim becomes ripe. On the other hand, if\nthe petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition\nthat could not have been raised in the earlier petition\u2014\nperhaps because the error occurred for the first time dur\ning resentencing\u2014then the application raising the claim is\nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d and \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s bar does not\napply.\n  Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to\nshow that the application in this case is \u201csecond or succes\nsive,\u201d it must be noted that no previous case from this\nCourt has dealt with the precise sequence of events here:\nA petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim\nafter a second resentencing proceeding that followed a\ngrant of federal habeas relief. The conclusion that such an\napplication is barred as \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless the\nclaim was previously unavailable is consistent with the\napproach of every court of appeals that has considered the\nissue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties\nthat are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.\n6                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nSee, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62\u201363 (CA1\n1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37\u201338 (CA2\n1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871\n(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351\u2212353\n(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context\nof federal prisoners\u2019 challenges to their convictions or\nsentences under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255, the \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d bar under \u00a72244(b) applies to \u00a72255 motions. See\n\u00a72255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).\n   In the present case the Court should conclude that\nMagwood has filed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus\napplication.\u201d In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti\ntion raising nine claims, including that the trial court\nimproperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when\nit imposed Magwood\u2019s death sentence. The District Court\ngranted Magwood\u2019s petition and ordered relief only on the\nmitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a\nnew sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of\nthe mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.\nIn 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this\ntime raising an argument that could have been, but was\nnot, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he\nwas not eligible for the death penalty because he did not\nhave fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi\nble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have\nraised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.\nBecause Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju\ndicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in\n1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as\n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d\n                             II\n  The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill\ndefined exception to the \u201csecond or successive\u201d application\nbar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical\nerrors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti\u2019s claim-based\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\napproach to determining whether an application is \u201csecond\nor successive.\u201d Second, it imposes an atextual exception to\n\u00a72244(b)\u2019s bar against \u201csecond or successive\u201d applications,\nrequiring that the second-in-time application be brought\nagainst the same judgment. This second error is under\nscored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the\nlogical implications of its newly created rule.\n                              A\n   The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d applications rather than \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d claims, the nature of the claims raised in the\nsecond application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (\u201c[A]l\nthough we agree with the State that many of the rules\nunder \u00a72244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to\nrewrite the statute to make the phrase \u2018second or succes\nsive\u2019 modify claims as well\u201d). This is incorrect. As ex\nplained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether\nan application itself is \u201csecond or successive\u201d requires\nlooking to the nature of the claim that the application\nraises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and\nfair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.\nIndeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that\nthe application there was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d was to\nlook at the underlying claim the application raised. 551\nU. S., at 947.\n   While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into\ndoubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to\nexplain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\u201cBefore\nAEDPA\u2019s enactment, the phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019\nmeant the same thing it does today\u2014any subsequent\nfederal habeas application challenging a state-court judg\nment\u201d). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting\nits new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously\nunexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti\n8                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nto the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cToday\u2019s decision thus stands only for the\nproposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special\n(and unjustified) exemption from the statute\u2019s plain\nimport\u201d).\n   Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid\ning whether an application is barred as \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time\nhabeas petition challenging an alleged violation that\noccurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for\nexample, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time\npromised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of\ngood-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court\u2019s\nrule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng\ning those alleged violations would be barred as \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d because it would be a second-in-time applica\ntion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.\nThat result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ\nprinciples and might work a suspension of the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\n                              B\n  Having unmoored the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d\nfrom its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court\ncreates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is\nnot what makes an application \u201csecond or successive,\u201d\nthen to what should a court look? Finding no reference\npoint in \u00a72244(b)\u2019s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for\na different peg.\n  The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different\nprovision:\n    \u201c[A] district court shall entertain an application for a\n    writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody\n    pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the\n    ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti\n    tution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    \u00a72254(a).\nBut this provision does not purport to create any prerequi\nsites to \u00a72244(b)\u2019s bar against \u201csecond or successive\u201d appli\ncations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is\nthat this is a mere \u201cstatus requirement.\u201d See 1 R. Hertz &\nJ. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce\ndure \u00a78.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for\nthe simple proposition that a petitioner must be held\n\u201cpursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d to be able to\nfile any \u00a72254(b) petition in the first place. That reading\nalso explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not\nonly the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is\nbeing held but also \u201cthe duration of sentence . . . and . . .\nthe conditions under which that sentence is being served,\u201d\nincluding rules such as \u201cthe basis of parole\u201d and \u201cgood\ntime\u201d credits. Id., \u00a79.1, at 475\u2013481.\n   The Court\u2019s reading of the phrase \u201cpursuant to the\njudgment of a State court\u201d as a limitation on \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application bar is artificial. The\nCourt would amend \u00a72244(b)(2) to read: \u201cA claim pre\nsented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\nunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior\napplication [against the same judgment] shall be dis\nmissed.\u201d This is not what \u00a72244(b)(2) says.\n   The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob\nlem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the\nnotion that \u201c[a]n error made a second time is still a new\nerror.\u201d Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the\nCourt can mean one of two very different things:\n   First, it could mean that any error logically encom\npassed in a reentered judgment is a \u201cnew\u201d error. A crimi\nnal \u201cjudgment\u201d generally includes both the conviction and\nthe sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a\ncriminal judgment \u201cmust set forth the plea, the jury ver\ndict or the court\u2019s findings, the adjudication, and the\n10               MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsentence\u201d); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)\n(\u201cAs we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily\nincludes the sentence imposed upon the defendant\u201d). This\nwell-established principle applies in the federal habeas\ncontext, where petitioner is \u201cin custody pursuant to the\njudgment.\u201d \u00a72254(b). A person cannot be held in custody\n\u201cpursuant to\u201d a sentence, but only pursuant to \u201cthe\u201d (e.g.,\none) judgment, which includes both the conviction and\nsentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156\u2013157\n(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations did not run until the judgment\u2014\u201cboth his\nconviction and sentence became final\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Under this principle, the Court\u2019s holding today would\nallow a challenger in Magwood\u2019s position to raise any\nchallenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment\nagainst him in his second application, since a \u201cnew\u201d judg\nment\u2014consisting of both the conviction and sentence\u2014has\nnow been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)\noccurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court\nhere reentered the following judgment after resentencing:\n\u201cIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY\nTHE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the\noffense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag\nwood is sentenced to death.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.\nThis would mean that Magwood\u2019s attorney could dig\nthrough anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross\nexamination of witnesses to the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, and\nraise any alleged errors for the first time in his second\nhabeas application, all because the trial court did not\nproperly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood\u2019s\nfirst sentencing proceeding.\n   Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even\nfurther from the statutory text and conclude that only\nsome parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal\nlenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfor example, argues that he can only challenge previously\nunraised errors made during sentencing. Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, n. 8. Indeed, Magwood goes further and sug\ngests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a\ncase where a court\u2019s order leads the trial court to revise\nonly the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release. Id., at 28,\nn. 11. If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the\ncriminal-judgment exception to the \u201csecond or successive\u201d\napplication bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood\nnow raises is a \u201cnew error\u201d at all. After all, Magwood did\nnot challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas peti\ntion but only disputed that he should not get the death\npenalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court prop\nerly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.\nThe state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no\nreason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Mag\nwood is death eligible. It is hard to see how the trial\ncourt\u2019s failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous death\neligibility finding is a \u201cnew error,\u201d any more than its fail\nure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken\nplace at the guilt phase would have been new errors.\n   The Court contends the approach dictated by Panetti\n\u201cconsiderably undermine[s]\u2014if not render[s] superfluous,\u201d\nante, at 14, the exceptions in \u00a72244(b)(2), which allow a\npetitioner to bring a claim in a \u201csecond or successive\u201d\napplication based on certain factual discoveries or based\non a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied\nretroactively. The Court seems to be saying that applying\nPanetti\u2019s rule would make the exceptions superfluous,\nbecause any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would\nnecessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the\nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. But the Court misconceives\nthe scope of the rule that an application is only \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d if it raises for the first time a claim that could\nhave been raised before. A second petition raising a claim\nthat could have been raised in a prior petition, even\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthough strengthened by a new decision from this Court or\nbased upon newly discovered evidence, is still \u201csecond or\nsuccessive.\u201d Thus this subsequent application would only\nbe permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection\n(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court\u2019s approach that\nlimits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.\nUnder the Court\u2019s theory, the \u201csecond or successive\u201d bar\ndoes not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in\nMagwood\u2019s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep\ntions would have no operation in that context.\n                               III\n   The Court\u2019s approach disregards AEDPA\u2019s \u201c \u2018principles\nof comity, finality, and federalism.\u2019 \u201d Panetti, 551 U. S., at\n945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the\nCourt\u2019s newly created exception to the \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even\nthe most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc\ning would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims\nin his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he\nfailed to raise in his first petition. \u201c[I]f reexamination of\n[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal\nism and comity, the offense increases when a State must\ndefend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas\nproceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti\ntion.\u201d McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.\n   The Court\u2019s novel exception would also allow the once\nsuccessful petitioner to reraise every argument against a\nsentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the\nfirst round of federal habeas review. As respondents\nexplain, under the Court\u2019s theory, \u201ca post-resentencing\npetitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the\nwords, \u2018\u00a72254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,\u2019 to his\npreviously adjudicated petition.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n47.

It is\ndifficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals\nto do their best work, day after day, when they have to\ndeal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously\nrejected or otherwise abusive claims. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court is mandating, under a statute that was\ndesigned to require just the opposite result. If the analy\nsis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States\nwill document the ill effects of the Court\u2019s opinion so that\nits costs and deficiencies are better understood if this\nissue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.\n   The Court\u2019s new exception will apply not only to death\npenalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised\nclaim appears arguably meritorious. It will apply to all\nfederal habeas petitions following a prior successful peti\ntion, most of which will not be in death cases and where\nthe abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack\nmerit. And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court\u2019s\ndecision means that States subject to federal habeas re\nview henceforth receive less recognition of a finality inter\nest than the Federal Government does on direct review of\nfederal criminal convictions. See United States v. Parker,\n101 F. 3d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (\u201cA party\n14                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second\nappeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in\nthe first appeal because the remand did not affect it\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s approach also turns AEDPA\u2019s bar against\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d applications into a one-way ratchet\nthat favors habeas petitioners. Unless today\u2019s decision is\nread to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7\u20138, AEDPA\nstill incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of\nthe-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ\nously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But after today\u2019s holding, AEDPA now \u201cmodi\nfie[s],\u201d ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows\npetitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have\nwon any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti\ntion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new\nloophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge\ntheir sentences based on grounds they previously ne\nglected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand\ning that AEDPA adds \u201cnew restrictions on successive\npetitions\u201d and \u201cfurther restricts the availability of relief to\nhabeas petitioners.\u201d Felker v.

PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u2013158.      Argued March 24, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nPetitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder. After the Ala\n  bama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction pro\n  ceedings, he sought federal habeas relief. The District Court condi\n  tionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be\n  released or resentenced. The state trial court sentenced him to death\n  a second time. He filed another federal habeas application, challeng\n  ing this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warn\n  ing at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death\n  sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffec\n  tive assistance during the resentencing proceeding. The District\n  Court once again conditionally granted the writ. The Eleventh Cir\n  cuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\u2019s challenge to\n  his new death sentence was an unreviewable \u201csecond or successive\u201d\n  challenge under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b) because he could have raised his\n  fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n555 F. 3d 968, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV\u2013B, concluding that because Magwood\u2019s habeas application\n  challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not \u201csecond or suc\n  cessive\u201d under \u00a72244(b). Pp. 8\u201315, 17\u201322.\n    (a) This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a\n  \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus application.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1), (2).\n  The State contends that \u00a72244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to\n  bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present. Under\n  this \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, Magwood\u2019s fair-warning claim was \u201csec\n2                       MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ond and successive\u201d because he had an opportunity to raise it in his\n    first application but did not. Magwood counters that \u00a72244(b) should\n    not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment interven\n    ing between habeas applications. This Court agrees. The phrase\n    \u201csecond or successive\u201d is not defined by AEDPA and it is a \u201cterm of\n    art.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486. To determine its mean\n    ing, the Court looks first to the statutory context. Section 2244(b)\u2019s\n    limitations apply only to a \u201chabeas corpus application under \u00a72254,\u201d\n    i.e., an application on \u201cbehalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\n    judgment of a State court,\u201d \u00a72254(b)(1). Both \u00a72254(b)\u2019s text and the\n    relief it provides indicate that \u201csecond or successive\u201d must be inter\n    preted with respect to the judgment challenged. A \u00a72254 petitioner\n    \u201cseeks invalidation . . . of the judgment authorizing [his] confine\n    ment,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83. If a conditional writ is\n    granted, \u201cthe State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or\n    a new sentencing proceeding).\u201d Ibid. The State errs in contending\n    that, if \u00a72254 is relevant at all, \u201ccustody\u201d and not \u201cjudgment,\u201d is the\n    proper reference because unlawful \u201ccustody\u201d is the \u201csubstance\u201d re\n    quirement for habeas relief. This argument is unpersuasive. Section\n    2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under\n    \u00a72254. Because \u00a72254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state\n    court judgment, that \u201cjudgment\u201d is inextricable and essential to re\n    lief. It is a requirement that distinguishes \u00a72254 from other statutes\n    permitting constitutional relief. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a72255, 2241. The State\u2019s\n    \u201ccustody\u201d-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying \u201csec\n    ond or successive\u201d to any subsequent application filed before a pris\n    oner\u2019s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous\n    custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy \u00a72244(b)\u2019s strict rules to\n    challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\n    statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result. Pp. 8\u2013\n    13.\n       (b) This Court is also not convinced by the State\u2019s argument that a\n    \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule would be consistent with the statute and\n    should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA\u2019s purpose of pre\n    venting piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship. AEDPA uses \u201csec\n    ond or successive\u201d to modify \u201capplication,\u201d not \u201cclaim\u201d as the State\n    contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of\n    \u00a72244(b) that would \u201celid[e] the difference between an \u2018application\u2019\n    and a \u2018claim,\u2019 \u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9. The State\u2019s reading\n    also reflects a more fundamental error. It would undermine or ren\n    der superfluous much of \u00a72244(b)(2). In some circumstances, it would\n    increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of\n    the-writ rules where \u00a72244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions. In others, it\n    would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (c) This Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72244(b) is consistent with its\n  precedents. Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State in\n  vokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies \u201csecond\n  or successive\u201d to an application challenging a new judgment, these\n  cases shed no light on the question presented here. Nor do post-\n  AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here. Only Burton v.\n  Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold ques\n  tion whether an application is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it challenges a\n  new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new\n  judgment is dispositive. In holding that both of the petitioner\u2019s ha\n  beas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Bur\n  ton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment inter\n  vening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been\n  different. Here, there is such an intervening judgment. This is Mag\n  wood\u2019s first application challenging that intervening judgment.\n  Magwood challenges not the trial court\u2019s error in his first sentencing,\n  but the court\u2019s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and\n  reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. Pp. 15, 17\u201321.\n     (d) Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underly\n  ing conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State\u2019s objec\n  tion that this reading of \u00a72244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a\n  conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application\n  challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\n  undisturbed conviction. Nor does the Court address whether Mag\n  wood\u2019s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the\n  Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n  counsel claim.

After the Alabama courts denied\nrelief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings,\nMagwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus\nin Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction\nand his sentence. The District Court conditionally granted\nthe writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood\neither be released or resentenced. The state trial court\nconducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced\nMagwood to death. Magwood filed an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new\nsentence. The District Court once again conditionally\ngranted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new\nsentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nreversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\u2019s chal\nlenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d challenge under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(b) because he could have mounted the same chal\nlenge to his original death sentence. We granted certio\n2                     MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrari, and now reverse. Because Magwood\u2019s habeas appli\ncation1 challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is\nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a72244(b).\n                             I\n   After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served\nseveral years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama,\nunder the watch of Sheriff C. F. \u201cNeil\u201d Grantham. During\nhis incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of\nmental illness, became convinced that Grantham had\nimprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even\nupon his release. Magwood followed through on his\nthreat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his\nrelease, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sher\niff\u2019s arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood\nshot him and fled the scene.\n   Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of\nan on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code\n\u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5) (1975).2 He was tried in 1981. The prose\ncution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggra\nvated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought\nthe death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason\nof insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital\nmurder under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of\ndeath based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Although 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b) refers to a habeas \u201capplication,\u201d we\n\nuse the word \u201cpetition\u201d interchangeably with the word \u201capplication,\u201d as\nwe have in our prior cases.\n   2 At the time of the murder, Alabama Code \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a) provided: \u201cIf\n\nthe jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death\nwhen the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following\noffenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the\nindictment . . . .\u201d The offenses included \u201cmurder of any . . . sheriff . . .\nwhile . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.\u201d \u00a713\u2013\n11\u20132(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of \u201caggravating circum\nstances,\u201d \u00a713\u201311\u20136, but the trial court found that none existed in\nMagwood\u2019s case.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In Kyzer, the defen\ndant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of \u201ctwo or\nmore human beings\u201d under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.\nThe crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,\njust as Magwood\u2019s crime of murder, as defined under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5),\nwas aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of\nthe sheriff\u2019s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court\nultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower\ncourt on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged\ncrime, see \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death\neven without a finding of any \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d enumerated\nin \u00a713\u201311\u20136. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was\nconvicted under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(10), \u201cthe jury and the trial judge at the\nsentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict\nment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is\nnot listed in \u00a713\u201311\u20136 as an aggravating circumstance.\u201d Id., at 339\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n4                     MAGWOOD v.

Smith, 791 F. 2d 1438,\n1450 (CA11 1986).\n   In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court\nheld a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.\nThis time, the judge found that Magwood\u2019s mental state,\nas well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as\nstatutory mitigating circumstances. As before, the court\nfound that Magwood\u2019s capital felony under \u00a713\u201311\u20132(a)(5)\nincluded sufficient aggravation to render him death eligi\nble. In his proposed findings, Magwood\u2019s attorney agreed\nthat Magwood\u2019s offense rendered him death eligible, but\nargued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in\nlight of the mitigating factors.

Alabama, 493 U. S. 923 (1989).\n   Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama\u2019s\nformer Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987)\n(now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming,\ninter alia, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum\nsentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence\nviolated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nbecause it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of\nthe capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney ren\ndered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentenc\ning. The trial court denied relief. It held that the statu\ntory basis for Magwood\u2019s death sentence had been\naffirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The\ntrial court also held that Magwood\u2019s attorney played no\nsubstantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation\nto dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court\nhad required only that the trial court consider additional\nmitigating factors.\n   Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition,\narguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional\nbecause he did not have fair warning that his offense could\nbe punished by death, and that he received constitution\nally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing.

See In re Magwood, 113 F. 3d 1544\n(CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,\nwhich the District Court conditionally granted.

In that petition, Magwood again argued that his\nsentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair\nwarning at the time of his offense that his conduct would\nbe sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama\nlaw, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance\nduring the resentencing proceeding.\n   Before addressing the merits of Magwood\u2019s fair-warning\nclaim, the District Court sua sponte considered whether\nthe application was barred as a \u201csuccessive petition\u201d under\n\u00a72244, and concluded that it was not.

S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\none attacked in an earlier petition, it cannot be said that\nthe two petitions are \u2018successive\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original))).\n   The District Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that\nMagwood had procedurally defaulted the fair-warning\nclaim by failing to present it adequately to the state\ncourts, noting that Magwood had presented the claim both\nin his Rule 20 petition and on appeal from the denial of\nthat petition. See 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285\u20131286; supra,\nat 5. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that\nMagwood\u2019s death sentence was unconstitutional because\n\u201cat the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have\nfair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at\nleast one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former\n1975 Ala. Code \u00a713\u201311\u20136.\u201d 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The\nDistrict Court also found the state court\u2019s grounds for\nrejecting Magwood\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim unrea\nsonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting\nthat Magwood\u2019s attorney in fact had engaged substan\ntively in the \u201ccomplete and new\u201d resentencing, and al\nthough the attorney could not be expected to object on\nstate-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly\nineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning\nclaim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 555\nF. 3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in\ndetermining whether \u00a72244(b) applies is to \u201cseparate the\nnew claims challenging the resentencing from the old\nclaims that were or should have been presented in the\nprior application.\u201d Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach, any\nclaim that \u201cchallenge[s] the new, amended component of\nthe sentence\u201d should be \u201cregarded as part of a first peti\ntion,\u201d and any claim that \u201cchallenge[s] any component of\nthe original sentence that was not amended\u201d should be\n\u201cregarded as part of a second petition.\u201d Ibid. Applying\nthis test, the court held that because Magwood\u2019s fair\n8                    MAGWOOD v.

Id., at 975\u2013976. The\nCourt of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Mag\nwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the\nexceptions to \u00a72244(b)\u2019s general rule requiring dismissal of\nclaims first presented in a successive application.7 See id.,\nat 976.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood\u2019s\napplication challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed\nas part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ\nfrom the District Court, is subject to the constraints that\n\u00a72244(b) imposes on the review of \u201csecond or successive\u201d\nhabeas applications. 558 U.

More specifically, it turns on\nwhen a claim should be deemed to arise in a \u201csecond or\nsuccessive habeas corpus application.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1), (2).\nIf an application is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d the petitioner\nmust obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing\nit with the district court. See \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The district\ncourt must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized\nsecond or successive application unless the applicant\nshows that the claim satisfies certain statutory require\nments. See \u00a72244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood\u2019s application\nwas \u201csecond or successive,\u201d the District Court should have\ndismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the\nrequisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If,\nhowever, Magwood\u2019s application was not second or succes\nsive, it was not subject to \u00a72244(b) at all, and his fair\nwarning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).\n   The State contends that although \u00a72244(b), as amended\nby AEDPA, applies the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to\n\u201capplication[s],\u201d it \u201cis a claim-focused statute,\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 22\u201324, and \u201c[c]laims, not applications, are\nbarred by \u00a72244(b),\u201d id., at 24 (citing Artuz v.

According to the State, the phrase\nshould be read to reflect a principle that \u201ca prisoner is\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to\nwage a collateral attack.\u201d See Brief for Respondents\n25\u201326 (citing Beyer v. Litscher, 306 F. 3d 504, 508 (CA7\n2002); internal quotation marks omitted). The State\nasserts that under this \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, Magwood\u2019s\nfair-warning claim was successive because he had an\nopportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not\ndo so. See Brief for Respondents 25\u201326.\n   Magwood, in contrast, reads \u00a72244(b) to apply only to a\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application challenging the same\nstate-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986\nresentencing led to a new judgment, and his first applica\ntion challenging that new judgment cannot be \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d such that \u00a72244(b) would apply. We agree.\n   We begin with the text. Although Congress did not\ndefine the phrase \u201csecond or successive,\u201d as used to modify\n\u201chabeas corpus application under section 2254,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1)\u2013(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not\nsimply \u201crefe[r] to all \u00a72254 applications filed second or\nsuccessively in time,\u201d Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930, 944 (2007); see id., at 947 (creating an \u201cexceptio[n]\u201d to\n\u00a72244(b) for a second application raising a claim that\nwould have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in\nhis first application); Stewart v.

To determine its meaning, we\nlook first to the statutory context. The limitations im\nposed by \u00a72244(b) apply only to a \u201chabeas corpus applica\ntion under \u00a72254,\u201d that is, an \u201capplication for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a State court,\u201d \u00a72254(b)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The reference to a state-court judgment in\n\u00a72254(b) is significant because the term \u201capplication\u201d\ncannot be defined in a vacuum. A \u00a72254 petitioner is\napplying for something: His petition \u201cseeks invalidation\n(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris\noner\u2019s confinement,\u201d Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83\n(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis\ntrict court\u2019s granting of the writ, \u201cthe State may seek a\nnew judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing\nproceeding).\u201d Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both\n\u00a72254(b)\u2019s text and the relief it provides indicate that the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d must be interpreted with\nrespect to the judgment challenged.\n   The State disagrees, contending that if the cross\nreference to \u00a72254 is relevant, we should focus not on the\nstatute\u2019s reference to a \u201cjudgment\u201d but on its reference to\n\u201ccustody,\u201d Brief for Respondents 53; compare \u00a7\u00a72254(a),\n(b) (establishing rules for review of \u201can application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus\u201d on \u201cbehalf of a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d (emphasis\nadded)) with \u00a72254(a) (specifying that an application may\nbe entertained \u201conly on the ground that [the petitioner] is\nin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea\nties of the United States\u201d (emphasis added)). The State\nexplains that unlawful \u201ccustody\u201d is the key \u201c \u2018substance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nAEDPA.\u201d 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-\n\nAEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question\n\npresented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13. \n\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement\u2019 \u201d of \u00a72254, whereas being held pursuant to a\nstate-court \u201cjudgment\u201d is merely a \u201c \u2018status requirement.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman & Hertz,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a78.1,\np. 391).\n   We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254\narticulates the kind of confinement that may be chal\nlenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held \u201cin\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a72254(a). The requirement of custody\npursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes \u00a72254\nfrom other statutory provisions authorizing relief from\nconstitutional violations\u2014such as \u00a72255, which allows\nchallenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983, which allows federal-court suits against\nstate and local officials. Custody is crucial for \u00a72254\npurposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that\nauthorizes it.\n   The State\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d-based rule is difficult to justify for\nanother reason. Under the State\u2019s approach, applying the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to any subsequent applica\ntion filed before a prisoner\u2019s release would mean that a\nprisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com\npletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the\nstrict rules for review under \u00a72244(b) to challenge his\nunrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the\nstatutory text or context supports, much less requires,\nsuch an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at\n507 (\u201c[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral\nattack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of\nimprisonment\u201d); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85 (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (\u201c[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one\nof several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate\nthe challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

According to the State, a\n\u201cone opportunity\u201d rule is consistent with the statutory\ntext, and better reflects AEDPA\u2019s purpose of preventing\npiecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.\n   We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase \u201csecond\nor successive\u201d to modify \u201capplication.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1),\n(2). The State reads the phrase to modify \u201cclaims.\u201d See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (\u201cCongress\u2019 intent for\nAEDPA was to eradicate successive claims\u201d). We cannot\nreplace the actual text with speculation as to Congress\u2019\nintent. We have previously found Congress\u2019 use of the\nword \u201capplication\u201d significant, and have refused to adopt\nan interpretation of \u00a72244(b) that would \u201celid[e] the differ\nence between an \u2018application\u2019 and a \u2018claim,\u2019 \u201d Artuz, 531\nU. S., at 9; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 530\n(2005) (\u201c[F]or purposes of \u00a72244(b), an \u2018application\u2019 for\nhabeas relief is a filing that contains one or more\n\u2018claims\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, although we agree with the State\nthat many of the rules under \u00a72244(b) focus on claims,\nthat does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d modify claims as well.10\n   The State\u2019s reading leads to a second, more fundamental\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements.\n\nSee Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to \u201cask for relief\nfrom the state-court judgment being contested\u201d); Rule 2(e) (prescribing\nthat any \u201cpetitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one\nstate court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or\njudgments of each court\u201d).\n   10 The dissent recognizes that the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d ap\n\nplies to an application as a whole, see post, at 2\u20134 (opinion of KENNEDY,\nJ.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see\ninfra, at 14\u201315.\n14                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nerror. Under the State\u2019s \u201cone opportunity\u201d rule, the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d would apply to any claim\nthat the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise\nin a prior application. And the phrase \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not\nhave a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.\n   This reading of \u00a72244(b) would considerably under\nmine\u2014if not render superfluous\u2014the exceptions to dis\nmissal set forth in \u00a72244(b)(2). That section describes\ncircumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be\nconsidered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly\ndiscovered facts suggesting \u201cthat . . . no reasonable fact\nfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the under\nlying offense.\u201d \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,\na petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity\nto raise the claim, so under the State\u2019s rule the claim\nwould not be successive and \u00a72244(b)(2) would not apply to\nit at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised\nin a second application challenging the same judgment.11\n   In addition to duplicating the exceptions under \u00a72244(b)\nin some circumstances, the State\u2019s rule would dilute them\nin others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact\nbased claims not presented in a prior application applies\nonly if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 This case does not require us to determine whether \u00a72244(b) ap\n\nplies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a\nstate-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court\njudgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,\n523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945\n(2007).\n  The dissent\u2019s claim that our reading of \u00a72244(b) calls one of those\ndecisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 7\u20138, is unfounded. The\nquestion in this case is whether a first application challenging a new\nsentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not\nwhether an application challenging the same state-court judgment\nmust always be second or successive.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthat, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense,\u201d \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State\u2019s rule, all that\nmatters is that the facts \u201ccould not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence,\u201d\n\u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(i). We decline to adopt a reading that\nwould thus truncate \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s requirements.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that\nthe approach we take here contradicts our precedents.\nThe State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying\nreview of claims in second or successive applications\nwhere the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior\nopportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.\nUnited States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465\nU. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464\nU. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320\n(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467\n(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag\nwood\u2019s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second\nor successive because he could have raised\u2014but did not\nraise\u2014the claim in his first application.\n   But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the\nphrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d to an application challenging\na new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on\nthe question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the\nwrit rules, as modified by AEDPA under \u00a72244(b)(2), apply\nat all to an application challenging a new judgment. The\nState\u2019s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its\nfailure to distinguish between \u00a72244(b)\u2019s threshold inquiry\ninto whether an application is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d and\nits subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive\napplication must be dismissed.\n16                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d by reference to our longstanding\ndoctrine governing abuse of the writ. AEDPA modifies\nthose abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statu\ntory rules under \u00a72244(b). These rules apply only to \u201csec\nond or successive\u201d applications. The dissent contends that\nthis reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range\nof abusive claims that would have been barred under prior\nrules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this\nCourt has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the\npetitioner raised it in an application challenging a new\njudgment.\n   The dissent\u2019s conclusion that our reading of \u00a72254 \u201cun\nmoor[s] the phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 from its textual\nand historical underpinnings,\u201d post, at 8, is unwarranted.\nPre-AEDPA usage of the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is\nconsistent with our reading. A review of our habeas\nprecedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirma\ntively define the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d as it ap\npears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to applications filed by state prison\ners until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose\nin the federal context, see \u00a72255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and\napplied only to applications raising previously adjudicated\nclaims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 12\n(1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit\ndismissal of \u201cabusive\u201d claims\u2014as distinguished from\n\u201csuccessive\u201d claims, see ibid.\u2014Congress codified restric\ntions on both types of claims in \u00a72244(b), but still without\nusing the phrase \u201csecond or successive.\u201d See \u00a72244(b)\n(1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applica\ntions filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not\nuntil 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d into \u00a72244(b). In light of this complex history\nof the phrase \u201csecond or successive,\u201d we must rely upon\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe current text to determine when the phrase applies,\nrather than pre-AEDPA precedents or superseded statu\ntory formulations.12\n                             C\n   Nor do our post-AEDPA cases contradict our approach.\nOnly one, Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147 (2007) (per\ncuriam), comes close to addressing the threshold question\nwhether an application is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it chal\nlenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the\nexistence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the\npetitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court\nin 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen\ntencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.\nId., at 150. The state appellate court affirmed the convic\ntion but remanded for a second resentencing. Ibid. In\nMarch 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment\nand new sentence. Id., at 151. In December 1998, with\nstate review of his new sentence still pending, the peti\ntioner filed a \u00a72254 application challenging his 1994 con\nviction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.\n   In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,\nthe petitioner filed a \u00a72254 petition challenging only his\n1998 sentence. The District Court denied relief on the\nmerits and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,\nholding that the petition challenging the sentence should\nhave been dismissed as an unauthorized \u201csecond or suc\ncessive\u201d application. Id., at 153; see \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). We\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent speculates about issues far beyond the question before\n\nthe Court. See, e.g., post, at 8\u20139 (suggesting that our judgment-based\nreading of \u00a72244(b) calls into question precedents recognizing habeas\npetitions challenging the denial of good-time credits or parole). We\naddress only an application challenging a new state-court judgment for\nthe first time. We do not purport to constrain the scope of \u00a72254 as we\nhave previously defined it.\n18                   MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected the petitioner\u2019s argument \u201cthat his 1998 and 2002\npetitions challenged different judgments.\u201d Id., at 155; see\nid., at 156\u2013157. Although petitioner had styled his first\npetition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his\nsecond petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we\nconcluded that both attacked the same \u201cjudgment\u201d be\ncause the 1998 sentence was already in place when the\npetitioner filed his first application for federal habeas\nrelief. See id., at 156. In other words, the judgment he\nchallenged in his 1998 application was \u201cthe same one\nchallenged in the subsequent 2002 petition\u201d; it \u201cwas the\njudgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being\ndetained.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recog\nnized that the case might have been different had there\nbeen a \u201cnew judgment intervening between the two ha\nbeas petitions.\u201d Ibid. There was no such judgment in\nBurton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.\n   This is Magwood\u2019s first application challenging that\nintervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is\nobvious to us\u2014and the State does not dispute\u2014that his\nclaim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon\nnew errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning\nclaim does not, because the state court made the same\nmistake before. We disagree. An error made a second\ntime is still a new error. That is especially clear here,\nwhere the state court conducted a full resentencing and\nreviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. See Sentencing\nTr., R. Tab 1, at R\u201325 (\u201cThe Court in f[or]mulating the\npresent judgment has considered the original record of the\ntrial and sentence. . . . The present judgment and sentence\nhas been the result of a complete and new assessment of all\nof the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Cf.

A petitioner may not raise\nin federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in\nstate court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the\nerror. If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural re\nquirements for bringing an error to the state court\u2019s atten\ntion\u2014whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings,\nas state law may require\u2014procedural default will bar\nfederal review. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n729\u2013730 (1991); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 848\n(1999) (stating that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to present\nthree of his federal habeas claims to the [state court] in a\ntimely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of\nthose claims\u201d). In this case, the State argued that Mag\nwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by\nfailing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the\n1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground.\nOnly after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally\ndefault the claim did the District Court sua sponte con\nsider whether \u00a72244(b) barred review.14 We leave that\nprocedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review\nin the first instance. Here, we underscore only that proce\ndural-default rules continue to constrain review of claims\nin all applications, whether the applications are \u201csecond or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[the petitioner] is attempting to challenge the constitutionality of a\nproceeding which obviously occurred after he filed, and obtained relief,\nin his first habeas petition\u201d).\n  14 See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416242\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416242/magwood-v-culliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

United States,\n540 U. S. 375, 381 (2003). Many examples can be given,\nbut one suffices to illustrate this point. Suppose that a\npetitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious\nclaims challenging his conviction. The district court\ngrants a conditional writ based on one of them, without\nreaching the remaining nine. Upon retrial, the state court\ncommits the same 10 legal mistakes. (These are new\nerrors, but no more new than the sentencing error in\nMagwood\u2019s case.) Is an application presenting those same\n10 claims\u2014now based on the errors in the new judg\nment\u2014\u201csecond or successive\u201d? Under the opportunity\nbased rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the\nanswer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dis\nmissed. See \u00a72244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim\npresented in a prior application). The State attempts to\navoid this \u201cprocedural anomal[y],\u201d Castro, supra, at 380,\nby suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims\nas part of a first application, because they were never\nadjudicated on the merits. Cf. Slack, 529 U. S., at\n478\u2013481; Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 643\u2013645. As for\nthe adjudicated claim, \u201c[r]espondents assume that state\njudges will follow instructions imposed by federal courts,\u201d\nand if not, \u201cthat federal courts will consider a petitioner\u2019s\nclaim that the state court violated due process by failing to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The dissent\u2019s concern that such a petitioner may \u201creraise every\n\nargument against a sentence that was rejected by the federal courts\nduring the first round of federal habeas review,\u201d post, at 12, is similarly\nhyperbolic.

We see no need to engage in such novel and complex\nrationalizations.    AEDPA\u2019s text commands a more\nstraightforward rule: where, unlike in Burton, there is a\n\u201cnew judgment intervening between the two habeas peti\ntions,\u201d 549 U. S., at 156, an application challenging the\nresulting new judgment is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d at all.\n                            V\n   The State objects that our reading of \u00a72244(b) would\nallow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his\nsentence to file a subsequent application challenging not\nonly his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,\nundisturbed conviction. The State believes this result\nfollows because a sentence and conviction form a single\n\u201cjudgment\u201d for purposes of habeas review. This case gives\nus no occasion to address that question, because Magwood\nhas not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16\nWe base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not\naltered by consequences the State speculates will follow in\nanother case.17\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood\u2019s first\napplication challenging his new sentence under the 1986\njudgment is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a72244(b).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Several Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds\non a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the\n\u201cportion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful\naction.\u201d Lang v.

The Court neither purports to alter nor\ndoes alter our holding in Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930 (2007). See ante, at 14, n. 11. In Panetti, we \u201cdeclined\nto interpret \u2018second or successive\u2019 as referring to all \u00a72254\napplications filed second or successively in time, even\nwhen the later filings address a state-court judgment\nalready challenged in a prior \u00a72254 application.\u201d 551 U. S.\nat 944 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, we\ndetermine how 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b) applies to a habeas\npetition that is the first petition to address a new \u201cstate\ncourt judgment\u201d that has not \u201calready [been] challenged in\na prior \u00a72254 application.\u201d And, for the reasons provided\nby the Court, such a \u201cfirst\u201d petition is not \u201csecond or suc\ncessive.\u201d Of course, as the dissent correctly states, if\nMagwood were challenging an undisturbed state-court\njudgment for the second time, abuse-of-the-writ principles\nwould apply, including Panetti\u2019s holding that an \u201capplica\ntion\u201d containing a \u201cclaim\u201d that \u201cthe petitioner had no fair\nopportunity to raise\u201d in his first habeas petition is not a\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application. Post, at 3 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, post, at\n6\u20138, the Court\u2019s decision today and our decision in Panetti\nfit comfortably together.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

TONY\n\n           PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n   The Court today decides that a state prisoner who suc\nceeds in his first federal habeas petition on a discrete\nsentencing claim may later file a second petition raising\nnumerous previously unraised claims, even if that petition\nis an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus. The Court, in my\nrespectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misread\ning precedents on the meaning of the phrase \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The Court then rewrites\nAEDPA\u2019s text but refuses to grapple with the logical con\nsequences of its own editorial judgment. A straightfor\nward application of the principles articulated in Panetti v.\nQuarterman, 551 U. S. 930 (2007), consistent with the\nconclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have con\nsidered this issue, dictates the opposite result. The design\nand purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of\nhabeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ\u2019s\nintrusive effect on state criminal justice systems. But\ntoday\u2019s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step\nback from AEDPA protection for States but also a step\nback even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in\nplace before AEDPA. So this respectful dissent becomes\nnecessary.\n2                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n  Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the\nrelevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:\n    \u201cA claim presented in a second or successive habeas\n    corpus application under section 2254 that was not\n    presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\n    . . . .\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b)(2).\nThe question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy\nJoe Magwood filed \u201ca second or successive\u201d application by\nraising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had\navailable and yet failed to raise in his first petition.\n   The term \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a habeas \u201cterm of\nart.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It\nincorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi\nple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to\ndetermine whether an application is \u201csecond or succes\nsive,\u201d a court must look to the substance of the claim the\napplication raises and decide whether the petitioner had a\nfull and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior\napplication. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this\nanalytical framework puts applications into one of three\ncategories.\n   First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to\nraise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time\napplication that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as\n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d This is consistent with pre-AEDPA\ncases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar\non \u201csecond or successive\u201d applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo\nv. United States, 265 U. S. 239, 241 (1924) (second applica\ntion barred where petitioner had a \u201cfull opportunity to\noffer proof\u201d of the same claim in his first habeas applica\ntion); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U. S. 377, 379 (1984)\n(Powell, J., concurring, writing for a majority of the Court)\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n(second application barred for claims that \u201ccould and\nshould have been raised in [the] first petition\u201d); Delo v.\nStokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (subsequent\napplication barred for a claim that \u201ccould have been raised\nin his first petition for federal habeas corpus\u201d). As\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, \u201ca\npetitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub\nsequent petition that he could have raised in his first,\nregardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier\nstemmed from a deliberate choice.\u201d See also Habeas Cor\npus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to \u201cspecify all\nthe grounds for relief available to [them]\u201d and to \u201cstate the\nfacts supporting each ground\u201d); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298, 317\u2013323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,\nthrough legislation and judicial decision, of modified res\njudicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata doctrine bars \u201cmatters that [were not, but] ought\nto have been raised\u201d in prior litigation).\n   Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise\nthe claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica\ntion raising that claim is not \u201csecond or successive,\u201d and\n\u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s bar does not apply. This can occur where the\nclaim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,\ne.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation\noccurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as\nthe State\u2019s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required\nby state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898\u2013\n899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v. Norris, 251 F. 3d 720, 723\u2013725\n(CA8 2001); In re Cain, 137 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).\nAnd to respond to the Court\u2019s concern, see ante, at 20, if\nthe applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he\nraised in his first petition but the District Court left unad\ndressed at its own discretion, the second application would\nnot be \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Reraising a previously\n4                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the\nCourt believes there are \u201c[m]any examples\u201d where abuse\nof-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris\noners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would\nthink the Court would be able to come up with an exam\nple. It does not do so.\n   Third, a \u201cmixed petition\u201d\u2014raising both abusive and\nnonabusive claims\u2014would be \u201csecond or successive.\u201d In\nthat circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain\nauthorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the\nnonabusive claims. See \u00a72244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore\net al., Federal Practice \u00a7671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After\nthe court of appeals makes its determination, a district\ncourt may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner\nhad no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and\ndismiss the abusive claims. See \u00a72244(b)(4).\n   The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Panetti. Panetti\u2019s claim that he was\nmentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain\nwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until\nafter the denial of his first habeas petition. When the\nFord claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas\npetition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con\ncluding that this second habeas petition was not a \u201csecond\nor successive\u201d application, this Court explained that \u201csec\nond or successive\u201d did not \u201crefe[r] to all \u00a72254 applications\nfiled second or successively in time,\u201d but was rather a\nterm-of-art that \u201ctakes its full meaning from our case law,\nincluding decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].\u201d\n551 U. S., at 943\u2013944. The Court relied on AEDPA\u2019s\npurpose of \u201c \u2018further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,\nand federalism,\u2019 \u201d id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the \u201cempty\nformality requiring prisoners to file unripe\u201d claims, 551\nU. S., at 946, and this Court\u2019s pre-AEDPA cases regarding\nthe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nlooked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in\ntime habeas petition to determine that the application was\nnot \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Ibid.\n  The above principles apply to a situation, like the pre\nsent one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceed\ning succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,\nwhich allows the state court to correct an error that oc\ncurred at the original sentencing. Assume, as alleged\nhere, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing\nproceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake\nthat also occurred at the first sentencing. The second\napplication is \u201csecond or successive\u201d with respect to that\nclaim because the alleged error \u201ccould and should have\u201d\nbeen raised in the first petition. Woodard, 464 U. S., at\n379 (opinion of Powell, J.). Put another way, under abuse\nof-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to chal\nlenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportu\nnity after his claim becomes ripe. On the other hand, if\nthe petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition\nthat could not have been raised in the earlier petition\u2014\nperhaps because the error occurred for the first time dur\ning resentencing\u2014then the application raising the claim is\nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d and \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s bar does not\napply.\n  Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to\nshow that the application in this case is \u201csecond or succes\nsive,\u201d it must be noted that no previous case from this\nCourt has dealt with the precise sequence of events here:\nA petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim\nafter a second resentencing proceeding that followed a\ngrant of federal habeas relief. The conclusion that such an\napplication is barred as \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless the\nclaim was previously unavailable is consistent with the\napproach of every court of appeals that has considered the\nissue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties\nthat are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.\n6                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nSee, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62\u201363 (CA1\n1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37\u201338 (CA2\n1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871\n(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351\u2212353\n(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context\nof federal prisoners\u2019 challenges to their convictions or\nsentences under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255, the \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d bar under \u00a72244(b) applies to \u00a72255 motions. See\n\u00a72255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).\n   In the present case the Court should conclude that\nMagwood has filed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus\napplication.\u201d In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti\ntion raising nine claims, including that the trial court\nimproperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when\nit imposed Magwood\u2019s death sentence. The District Court\ngranted Magwood\u2019s petition and ordered relief only on the\nmitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a\nnew sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of\nthe mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.\nIn 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this\ntime raising an argument that could have been, but was\nnot, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he\nwas not eligible for the death penalty because he did not\nhave fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi\nble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have\nraised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.\nBecause Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju\ndicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in\n1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as\n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d\n                             II\n  The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill\ndefined exception to the \u201csecond or successive\u201d application\nbar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical\nerrors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti\u2019s claim-based\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\napproach to determining whether an application is \u201csecond\nor successive.\u201d Second, it imposes an atextual exception to\n\u00a72244(b)\u2019s bar against \u201csecond or successive\u201d applications,\nrequiring that the second-in-time application be brought\nagainst the same judgment. This second error is under\nscored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the\nlogical implications of its newly created rule.\n                              A\n   The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d applications rather than \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d claims, the nature of the claims raised in the\nsecond application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (\u201c[A]l\nthough we agree with the State that many of the rules\nunder \u00a72244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to\nrewrite the statute to make the phrase \u2018second or succes\nsive\u2019 modify claims as well\u201d). This is incorrect. As ex\nplained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether\nan application itself is \u201csecond or successive\u201d requires\nlooking to the nature of the claim that the application\nraises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and\nfair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.\nIndeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that\nthe application there was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d was to\nlook at the underlying claim the application raised. 551\nU. S., at 947.\n   While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into\ndoubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to\nexplain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.\nPanetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\u201cBefore\nAEDPA\u2019s enactment, the phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019\nmeant the same thing it does today\u2014any subsequent\nfederal habeas application challenging a state-court judg\nment\u201d). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting\nits new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously\nunexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti\n8                 MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nto the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cToday\u2019s decision thus stands only for the\nproposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special\n(and unjustified) exemption from the statute\u2019s plain\nimport\u201d).\n   Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid\ning whether an application is barred as \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time\nhabeas petition challenging an alleged violation that\noccurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for\nexample, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time\npromised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of\ngood-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court\u2019s\nrule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng\ning those alleged violations would be barred as \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d because it would be a second-in-time applica\ntion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.\nThat result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ\nprinciples and might work a suspension of the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\n                              B\n  Having unmoored the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d\nfrom its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court\ncreates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is\nnot what makes an application \u201csecond or successive,\u201d\nthen to what should a court look? Finding no reference\npoint in \u00a72244(b)\u2019s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for\na different peg.\n  The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different\nprovision:\n    \u201c[A] district court shall entertain an application for a\n    writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody\n    pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the\n    ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti\n    tution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    \u00a72254(a).\nBut this provision does not purport to create any prerequi\nsites to \u00a72244(b)\u2019s bar against \u201csecond or successive\u201d appli\ncations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is\nthat this is a mere \u201cstatus requirement.\u201d See 1 R. Hertz &\nJ. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce\ndure \u00a78.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for\nthe simple proposition that a petitioner must be held\n\u201cpursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d to be able to\nfile any \u00a72254(b) petition in the first place. That reading\nalso explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not\nonly the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is\nbeing held but also \u201cthe duration of sentence . . . and . . .\nthe conditions under which that sentence is being served,\u201d\nincluding rules such as \u201cthe basis of parole\u201d and \u201cgood\ntime\u201d credits. Id., \u00a79.1, at 475\u2013481.\n   The Court\u2019s reading of the phrase \u201cpursuant to the\njudgment of a State court\u201d as a limitation on \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application bar is artificial. The\nCourt would amend \u00a72244(b)(2) to read: \u201cA claim pre\nsented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\nunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior\napplication [against the same judgment] shall be dis\nmissed.\u201d This is not what \u00a72244(b)(2) says.\n   The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob\nlem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the\nnotion that \u201c[a]n error made a second time is still a new\nerror.\u201d Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the\nCourt can mean one of two very different things:\n   First, it could mean that any error logically encom\npassed in a reentered judgment is a \u201cnew\u201d error. A crimi\nnal \u201cjudgment\u201d generally includes both the conviction and\nthe sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a\ncriminal judgment \u201cmust set forth the plea, the jury ver\ndict or the court\u2019s findings, the adjudication, and the\n10               MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsentence\u201d); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)\n(\u201cAs we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily\nincludes the sentence imposed upon the defendant\u201d). This\nwell-established principle applies in the federal habeas\ncontext, where petitioner is \u201cin custody pursuant to the\njudgment.\u201d \u00a72254(b). A person cannot be held in custody\n\u201cpursuant to\u201d a sentence, but only pursuant to \u201cthe\u201d (e.g.,\none) judgment, which includes both the conviction and\nsentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156\u2013157\n(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations did not run until the judgment\u2014\u201cboth his\nconviction and sentence became final\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Under this principle, the Court\u2019s holding today would\nallow a challenger in Magwood\u2019s position to raise any\nchallenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment\nagainst him in his second application, since a \u201cnew\u201d judg\nment\u2014consisting of both the conviction and sentence\u2014has\nnow been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)\noccurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court\nhere reentered the following judgment after resentencing:\n\u201cIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY\nTHE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the\noffense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag\nwood is sentenced to death.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.\nThis would mean that Magwood\u2019s attorney could dig\nthrough anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross\nexamination of witnesses to the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, and\nraise any alleged errors for the first time in his second\nhabeas application, all because the trial court did not\nproperly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood\u2019s\nfirst sentencing proceeding.\n   Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even\nfurther from the statutory text and conclude that only\nsome parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal\nlenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfor example, argues that he can only challenge previously\nunraised errors made during sentencing. Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, n. 8. Indeed, Magwood goes further and sug\ngests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a\ncase where a court\u2019s order leads the trial court to revise\nonly the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release. Id., at 28,\nn. 11. If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the\ncriminal-judgment exception to the \u201csecond or successive\u201d\napplication bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood\nnow raises is a \u201cnew error\u201d at all. After all, Magwood did\nnot challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas peti\ntion but only disputed that he should not get the death\npenalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court prop\nerly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.\nThe state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no\nreason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Mag\nwood is death eligible. It is hard to see how the trial\ncourt\u2019s failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous death\neligibility finding is a \u201cnew error,\u201d any more than its fail\nure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken\nplace at the guilt phase would have been new errors.\n   The Court contends the approach dictated by Panetti\n\u201cconsiderably undermine[s]\u2014if not render[s] superfluous,\u201d\nante, at 14, the exceptions in \u00a72244(b)(2), which allow a\npetitioner to bring a claim in a \u201csecond or successive\u201d\napplication based on certain factual discoveries or based\non a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied\nretroactively. The Court seems to be saying that applying\nPanetti\u2019s rule would make the exceptions superfluous,\nbecause any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would\nnecessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the\nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. But the Court misconceives\nthe scope of the rule that an application is only \u201csecond or\nsuccessive\u201d if it raises for the first time a claim that could\nhave been raised before. A second petition raising a claim\nthat could have been raised in a prior petition, even\n12                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthough strengthened by a new decision from this Court or\nbased upon newly discovered evidence, is still \u201csecond or\nsuccessive.\u201d Thus this subsequent application would only\nbe permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection\n(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court\u2019s approach that\nlimits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.\nUnder the Court\u2019s theory, the \u201csecond or successive\u201d bar\ndoes not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in\nMagwood\u2019s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep\ntions would have no operation in that context.\n                               III\n   The Court\u2019s approach disregards AEDPA\u2019s \u201c \u2018principles\nof comity, finality, and federalism.\u2019 \u201d Panetti, 551 U. S., at\n945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the\nCourt\u2019s newly created exception to the \u201csecond or succes\nsive\u201d application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even\nthe most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc\ning would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims\nin his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he\nfailed to raise in his first petition. \u201c[I]f reexamination of\n[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal\nism and comity, the offense increases when a State must\ndefend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas\nproceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti\ntion.\u201d McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.\n   The Court\u2019s novel exception would also allow the once\nsuccessful petitioner to reraise every argument against a\nsentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the\nfirst round of federal habeas review. As respondents\nexplain, under the Court\u2019s theory, \u201ca post-resentencing\npetitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the\nwords, \u2018\u00a72254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,\u2019 to his\npreviously adjudicated petition.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n47. Because traditional res judicata principles do not\napply to federal habeas proceedings, see Salinger v. Loisel,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924), this would force federal courts\nto address twice (or thrice, or more) the same claims of\nerror. The State and the victims would have to bear anew\nthe \u201c significant costs of federal habeas corpus review,\u201d\nMcCleskey, supra, at 490\u2013491, all because the petitioner\npreviously succeeded on a wholly different, discrete, and\npossibly unrelated claim.\n   The Court\u2019s suggestion that \u201c[i]t will not take a court\nlong to dispose of such claims where the court has already\nanalyzed the legal issues,\u201d ante, at 20, n. 15, misses the\npoint. This reassurance will be cold comfort to overworked\nstate district attorneys, who will now have to waste time\nand resources writing briefs analyzing dozens of claims\nthat should be barred by abuse-of-the-writ principles. It is\ndifficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals\nto do their best work, day after day, when they have to\ndeal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously\nrejected or otherwise abusive claims. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court is mandating, under a statute that was\ndesigned to require just the opposite result. If the analy\nsis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States\nwill document the ill effects of the Court\u2019s opinion so that\nits costs and deficiencies are better understood if this\nissue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.\n   The Court\u2019s new exception will apply not only to death\npenalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised\nclaim appears arguably meritorious. It will apply to all\nfederal habeas petitions following a prior successful peti\ntion, most of which will not be in death cases and where\nthe abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack\nmerit. And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court\u2019s\ndecision means that States subject to federal habeas re\nview henceforth receive less recognition of a finality inter\nest than the Federal Government does on direct review of\nfederal criminal convictions. See United States v. Parker,\n101 F. 3d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (\u201cA party\n14                MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second\nappeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in\nthe first appeal because the remand did not affect it\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s approach also turns AEDPA\u2019s bar against\n\u201csecond or successive\u201d applications into a one-way ratchet\nthat favors habeas petitioners. Unless today\u2019s decision is\nread to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7\u20138, AEDPA\nstill incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of\nthe-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ\nously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But after today\u2019s holding, AEDPA now \u201cmodi\nfie[s],\u201d ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows\npetitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have\nwon any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti\ntion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new\nloophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge\ntheir sentences based on grounds they previously ne\nglected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand\ning that AEDPA adds \u201cnew restrictions on successive\npetitions\u201d and \u201cfurther restricts the availability of relief to\nhabeas petitioners.\u201d Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664\n(1996).\n                        *    *     *\n  Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all\nagree that claims then available, but not raised, would be\nbarred. But because he prevailed in his attack on one part\nof his sentencing proceeding the first time around, the\nCourt rules that he is free, postsentencing, to pursue\nclaims on federal habeas review that might have been\nraised earlier. The Court is mistaken in concluding that\nCongress, in enacting a statute aimed at placing new\nrestrictions on successive petitions, would have intended\nthis irrational result.\n  Magwood had every chance to raise his death-eligibility\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nclaim in his first habeas petition. He has abused the writ\nby raising this claim for the first time in his second peti\ntion. His application is therefore \u201csecond or successive.\u201d I\nwould affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n</pre>",
