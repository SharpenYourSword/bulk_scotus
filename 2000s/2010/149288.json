INTERNATIONAL BROTHER-\n          HOOD OF TEAMSTERS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u20131214. Argued January 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nIn June 2004, respondent local union (Local), supported by its parent\n  international (IBT), initiated a strike against petitioner Granite\n  Rock, the employer of some of Local\u2019s members, following the expira\n  tion of the parties\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and an im\n  passe in their negotiations. On July 2, the parties agreed to a new\n  CBA containing no-strike and arbitration clauses, but could not reach\n  a separate back-to-work agreement holding local and international\n  union members harmless for any strike-related damages Granite\n  Rock incurred. IBT instructed Local to continue striking until Gran\n  ite Rock approved such a hold-harmless agreement, but the company\n  refused to do so, informing Local that continued strike activity would\n  violate the new CBA\u2019s no-strike clause. IBT and Local responded by\n  announcing a company-wide strike involving numerous facilities and\n  workers, including members of other IBT locals.\n     Granite Rock sued IBT and Local, invoking federal jurisdiction\n  under \u00a7301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA),\n  seeking strike-related damages for the unions\u2019 alleged breach of con\n  tract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because\n  the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new\n  CBA. The unions conceded \u00a7301(a) jurisdiction, but asserted that the\n  new CBA was never validly ratified by a vote of Local\u2019s members,\n  and, thus, the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause did not provide a basis for\n  Granite Rock to challenge the strike. After Granite Rock amended\n  its complaint to add claims that IBT tortiously interfered with the\n  new CBA, the unions moved to dismiss. The District Court granted\n  IBT\u2019s motion to dismiss the tortious interference claims on the\n  ground that \u00a7301(a) supports a federal cause of action only for breach\n2                 GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of contract. But the court denied Local\u2019s separate motion to send the\n    parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date to arbitration, ruling\n    that a jury should decide whether ratification occurred on July 2, as\n    Granite Rock contended, or on August 22, as Local alleged. After the\n    jury concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, the court ordered\n    arbitration to proceed on Granite Rock\u2019s breach-of-contract claims.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the tortious interference\n    claims, but reversed the arbitration order, holding that the parties\u2019\n    ratification-date dispute was a matter for an arbitrator to resolve un\n    der the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause. The Court of Appeals reasoned that\n    the clause covered the ratification-date dispute because the clause\n    clearly covered the related strike claims; national policy favoring ar\n    bitration required ambiguity about the arbitration clause\u2019s scope to\n    be resolved in favor of arbitrability; and, in any event, Granite Rock\n    had implicitly consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute by\n    suing under the contract.\nHeld:\n    1. The parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date was a mat\n ter for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve. Pp. 6\u201320.\n       (a) Whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute\n is typically an \u201c \u2018 issue for judicial determination,\u2019 \u201d e.g., Howsam v.\n Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83, as is a dispute over an\n arbitration contract\u2019s formation, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago,\n Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944. These principles would neatly\n dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical. But it\n is not. It is based on when (not whether) the new CBA containing the\n parties\u2019 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed. To de\n termine whether the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date\n is arbitrable, it is necessary to apply the rule that a court may order\n arbitration of a particular dispute only when satisfied that the par\n ties agreed to arbitrate that dispute. See, e.g., id., at 943. To satisfy\n itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue\n that calls into question the specific arbitration clause that a party\n seeks to have the court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\n Jackson, ante, at 4\u20136. Absent an agreement committing them to an\n arbitrator, such issues typically concern the scope and enforceability\n of the parties\u2019 arbitration clause. In addition, such issues always in\n clude whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that\n agreement was formed. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) In cases invoking the \u201cfederal policy favoring arbitration of\n labor disputes,\u201d Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368,\n 377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, e.g., AT&T Technolo\n gies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, and discharge\n their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nparticular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability\nonly where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is\nambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) order\ning arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, e.g.,\nid., at 651\u2013652. Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption\ntakes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitra\nbility. This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the\nprinciple that a court may submit to arbitration \u201conly those disputes\n. . . the parties have agreed to submit,\u201d First Options, supra, at 943,\nnor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for\nparty agreement, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648\u2212651.\nThe presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives\nits legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly\ncommitting the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular\ndispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement\nto arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best con\nstrued to encompass the dispute. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at\n944\u2013945. This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Cir\ncuit\u2019s judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related\nquestions central to Local\u2019s arbitration demand: when the CBA was\nformed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local\nwishes to arbitrate. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a\nformation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA\u2019s terms\nwas necessary to form the contract. For purposes of determining ar\nbitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it\nwas formed. That is so where, as here, an agreement\u2019s ratification\ndate determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its\nprovisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties\u2019\ndispute. This formation date question requires judicial resolution\nhere because it relates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand in a way that\nrequired the District Court to determine the CBA\u2019s ratification date\nin order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the mat\nters the demand covered. The CBA requires arbitration only of dis\nputes that \u201carise under\u201d the agreement. The parties\u2019 ratification-date\ndispute does not clearly fit that description. But the Ninth Circuit\ncredited Local\u2019s argument that the ratification-date dispute should be\npresumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dis\npute) that does clearly \u201carise under\u201d the CBA. The Ninth Circuit\noverlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date dispute\u2019s\narbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed\nuntil August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July\nno-strike dispute to \u201carise under.\u201d Local attempts to address this\nflaw in the Circuit\u2019s reasoning by arguing that a December 2004\n4                 GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of\n    May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired. The Court of Appeals\n    did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either be\n    cause it was not raised in Local\u2019s brief in opposition to the certiorari\n    petition. Pp. 13\u201317.\n          (d) Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is\n    that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dis\n    pute or not, falls outside the arbitration clause\u2019s scope on grounds the\n    presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure. CBA \u00a720 provides, in\n    ter alia, that \u201c[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be re\n    solved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\u201d which includes\n    arbitration. The parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute cannot properly be\n    said to fall within this provision\u2019s scope for at least two reasons.\n    First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2,\n    2004\u2014a question concerning the CBA\u2019s very existence\u2014cannot fairly\n    be said to \u201carise under\u201d the CBA. Second, even if the \u201carising under\u201d\n    language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, \u00a720\u2019s\n    remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing\n    that section\u2019s arbitration requirement as applicable to labor dis\n    agreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its re\n    quirement of mandatory mediation. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary\n    conclusion finds no support in \u00a720\u2019s text. That court\u2019s only effort to\n    grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Gran\n    ite Rock\u2019s claim to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike provisions could be\n    characterized as \u201carising under\u201d the agreement, which is not the dis\n    positive issue here. Pp. 17\u201318.\n          (e) Local\u2019s remaining argument in support of the Court of Ap\n    peals\u2019 judgment\u2014that Granite Rock \u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitra\n    tion when it sued to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike and arbitrable griev\n    ance provisions\u2014is similarly unavailing. Although it sought an\n    injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor\n    grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rock\u2019s decision to sue does not es\n    tablish an agreement, \u201cimplicit\u201d or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue\n    (the CBA\u2019s formation date) that the company did not raise and has\n    always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clause\u2019s scope.\n    Pp. 19\u201320.\n       2. The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new fed\n    eral common-law cause of action under LMRA \u00a7301(a) for IBT\u2019s al\n    leged tortious interference with the CBA. Though virtually all other\n    Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so\n    in this case is inconsistent with federal labor law\u2019s goal of promoting\n    industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement\n    of CBAs, and with this Court\u2019s precedents holding that a federal\n    common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451. The\n  company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other poten\n  tial avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims,\n  unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations\n  Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims,\n  are either unavailable or insufficient. But Granite Rock has not yet\n  exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide\n  an opportunity to judge their efficacy. Accordingly, it would be pre\n  mature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even as\n  suming \u00a7301(a) authorizes this Court to do so. That is particularly\n  true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already\n  prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below\n  and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the union\u2019s\n  attempts to delay the new CBA\u2019s ratification. Those proceedings, and\n  others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Gran\n  ite Rock\u2019s assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief\n  are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declin\n  ing to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.

The claims turn in\npart on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)\ncontaining a no-strike provision was validly formed during\nthe strike period. The employer contends that it was,\nwhile the unions contend that it was not. Because the\nCBA contains an arbitration clause, we first address\nwhether the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate was a matter for the District Court or an arbitrator to\nresolve. We conclude that it was a matter for judicial\nresolution. Next, we address whether the Court of Ap\npeals erred in declining the employer\u2019s request to recog\nnize a new federal cause of action under \u00a7301(a) of the\nLabor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat.\n156, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7185(a), for the international union\u2019s\nalleged tortious interference with the CBA. The Court of\nAppeals did not err in declining this request.\n2               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n   Petitioner Granite Rock Company is a concrete and\nbuilding materials company that has operated in Califor\nnia since 1900. Granite Rock employs approximately 800\nemployees under different labor contracts with several\nunions, including respondent International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters, Local 287 (Local). Granite Rock and Local\nwere parties to a 1999 CBA that expired in April 2004.\nThe parties\u2019 attempt to negotiate a new CBA hit an im\npasse and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a\nstrike in support of their contract demands.1\n   The strike continued until July 2, 2004, when the par\nties reached agreement on the terms of a new CBA. The\nCBA contained a no-strike clause but did not directly\naddress union members\u2019 liability for any strike-related\ndamages Granite Rock may have incurred before the new\nCBA was negotiated but after the prior CBA had expired.\nAt the end of the negotiating session on the new CBA,\nLocal\u2019s business representative, George Netto, approached\nGranite Rock about executing a separate \u201cback-to-work\u201d\nagreement that would, among other things, hold union\nmembers harmless for damages incurred during the June\n2004 strike. Netto did not make execution of such an\nagreement a condition of Local\u2019s ratification of the CBA, or\nof Local\u2019s decision to cease picketing. Thus, Local did not\nhave a back-to-work or hold-harmless agreement in place\nwhen it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2, 2004.\n   Respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n(IBT), which had advised Local throughout the CBA nego\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In deciding the arbitration question in this case we rely upon the\n\nterms of the CBA and the facts in the District Court record. In review\ning the judgment affirming dismissal of Granite Rock\u2019s tort claims\nagainst respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) for\nfailure to state a claim, we rely on the facts alleged in Granite Rock\u2019s\nThird Amended Complaint. See, e.g., H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell\nTelephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 250 (1989).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntiations and whose leadership and members supported the\nJune strike, opposed Local\u2019s decision to return to work\nwithout a back-to-work agreement shielding both Local\nand IBT members from liability for strike-related dam\nages. In an effort to secure such an agreement, IBT in\nstructed Local\u2019s members not to honor their agreement to\nreturn to work on July 5, and instructed Local\u2019s leaders to\ncontinue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to\nhold Local and IBT members free from liability for the\nJune strike. Netto demanded such an agreement on July\n6, but Granite Rock refused the request and informed\nLocal that the company would view any continued strike\nactivity as a violation of the new CBA\u2019s no-strike clause.\nIBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide\nstrike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds of\nworkers, including members of IBT locals besides Local\n287.\n   According to Granite Rock, IBT not only instigated this\nstrike; it supported and directed it. IBT provided pay and\nbenefits to union members who refused to return to work,\ndirected Local\u2019s negotiations with Granite Rock, supported\nLocal financially during the strike period with a $1.2\nmillion loan, and represented to Granite Rock that IBT\nhad unilateral authority to end the work stoppage in\nexchange for a hold-harmless agreement covering IBT\nmembers within and outside Local\u2019s bargaining unit.\n   On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and Local in\nthe District Court, seeking an injunction against the\nongoing strike and strike-related damages. Granite Rock\u2019s\ncomplaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal\njurisdiction under LMRA \u00a7301(a), alleged that the July 6\nstrike violated Local\u2019s obligations under the CBA\u2019s no\nstrike provision, and asked the District Court to enjoin the\nstrike because the hold-harmless dispute giving rise to the\nstrike was an arbitrable grievance. See Boys Markets, Inc.\nv. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 237\u2013238, 253\u2013254 (1970)\n4               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike where a\nCBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occa\nsions the strike). The unions conceded that LMRA \u00a7301(a)\ngave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but op\nposed Granite Rock\u2019s complaint, asserting that the CBA\nwas not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time\nrelevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike\nclause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock\u2019s claims\nchallenging the strike.\n   The District Court initially denied Granite Rock\u2019s re\nquest to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike provision because\nGranite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the\nCBA was ratified on July 2. App. 203\u2013213. Shortly after\nthe District Court ruled, however, a Local member testi\nfied that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote\non July 2, and that the voting Local members unani\nmously approved the agreement. Based on this statement\nand supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Gran\nite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and dam\nages claims.\n   On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local\nconducted a second successful \u201cratification\u201d vote on the\nCBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was\nscheduled to hear Granite Rock\u2019s motion, the unions called\noff their strike. Although their return to work mooted\nGranite Rock\u2019s request for an injunction, the District\nCourt proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite\nRock a new trial on its damages claims. The parties pro\nceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its\ncomplaint, which already alleged federal2 claims for\nbreach of the CBA against both Local and IBT, to add\nfederal inducement of breach and interference with con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 This Court has recognized a federal common-law claim for breach of\n\na CBA under LMRA \u00a7301(a). See, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills\nof Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456 (1957).\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntract (hereinafter tortious interference) claims against\nIBT.\n   IBT and Local both moved to dismiss. Among other\nthings, IBT argued that Granite Rock could not plead a\nfederal tort claim under \u00a7301(a) because that provision\nsupports a federal cause of action only for breach of con\ntract. The District Court agreed and dismissed Granite\nRock\u2019s tortious interference claims. The District Court did\nnot, however, grant Local\u2019s separate motion to send the\nparties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date to arbitra\ntion.3 The District Court held that whether the CBA was\nratified on July 2 or August 22 was an issue for the court\nto decide, and submitted the question to a jury. The jury\nreached a unanimous verdict that Local ratified the CBA\non July 2, 2004. The District Court entered the verdict\nand ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration on\nGranite Rock\u2019s breach-of-contract claims for strike-related\ndamages.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. See 546 F. 3d 1169 (2008). The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of\nGranite Rock\u2019s tortious interference claims against IBT.\nSee id., at 1170\u20131175. But it disagreed with the District\nCourt\u2019s determination that the date of the CBA\u2019s ratifica\ntion was a matter for judicial resolution. See id., at 1176\u2013\n1178. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the parties\u2019\ndispute over this issue was governed by the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause because the clause clearly covered the related\nstrike claims, the \u201cnational policy favoring arbitration\u201d\nrequired that any ambiguity about the scope of the parties\u2019\narbitration clause be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The CBA\u2019s ratification date is important to Granite Rock\u2019s underly\n\ning suit for strike damages. If the District Court correctly concluded\nthat the CBA was ratified on July 2, Granite Rock could argue on\nremand that the July work stoppage violated the CBA\u2019s no-strike\nclause.\n6             GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin any event, Granite Rock had \u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to\narbitrate the ratification-date dispute \u201cby suing under the\ncontract.\u201d Id., at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                                II\n   It is well settled in both commercial and labor cases that\nwhether parties have agreed to \u201csubmi[t] a particular\ndispute to arbitration\u201d is typically an \u201c \u2018 issue for judicial\ndetermination.\u2019 \u201d Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002) (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc.\nv. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986));\nsee John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543,\n546\u2013547 (1964). It is similarly well settled that where the\ndispute at issue concerns contract formation, the dispute\nis generally for courts to decide. See, e.g., First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995) (\u201cWhen\ndeciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain\nmatter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary . . .\nprinciples that govern the formation of contracts\u201d); AT&T\nTechnologies, supra, at 648\u2212649 (explaining the settled\nrule in labor cases that \u201c \u2018arbitration is a matter of con\ntract\u2019 \u201d and \u201carbitrators derive their authority to resolve\ndisputes only because the parties have agreed in advance\nto submit such grievances to arbitration\u201d); Buckeye Check\nCashing, Inc. v.

S. 440, 444, n. 1 (2006)\n(distinguishing treatment of the generally nonarbitral\nquestion whether an arbitration agreement was \u201cever\nconcluded\u201d from the question whether a contract con-\ntaining an arbitration clause was illegal when formed,\nwhich question we held to be arbitrable in certain\ncircumstances).\n   These principles would neatly dispose of this case if the\nformation dispute here were typical. But it is not. It is\nbased on when (not whether) the CBA that contains the\nparties\u2019 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nformed.4 And at the time the District Court considered\nLocal\u2019s demand to send this issue to an arbitrator, Granite\nRock, the party resisting arbitration, conceded both the\nformation and the validity of the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause.\n   These unusual facts require us to reemphasize the\nproper framework for deciding when disputes are arbitra\nble under our precedents. Under that framework, a court\nmay order arbitration of a particular dispute only where\nthe court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate\nthat dispute. See First Options, supra, at 943; AT&T\nTechnologies, supra, at 648\u2212649. To satisfy itself that\nsuch agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue\nthat calls into question the formation or applicability of\nthe specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have\nthe court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\nJackson, ante, at 4\u22126 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Where there\nis no provision validly committing them to an arbitrator,\nsee ante, at 7, these issues typically concern the scope of\nthe arbitration clause and its enforceability. In addition,\nthese issues always include whether the clause was agreed\nto, and may include when that agreement was formed.\n                           A\n  The parties agree that it was proper for the District\nCourt to decide whether their ratification dispute was\narbitrable.5 They disagree about whether the District\nCourt answered the question correctly. Local contends\nthat the District Court erred in holding that the CBA\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Although a union ratification vote is not always required for the\n\nprovisions in a CBA to be considered validly formed, the parties agree\nthat ratification was such a predicate here. See App. 349\u2013351.\n  5 Because neither party argues that the arbitrator should decide this\n\nquestion, there is no need to apply the rule requiring \u201c \u2018clear and\nunmistakable\u2019 \u201d evidence of an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability.\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995)\n(quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475\nU. S. 643, 649 (1986) (alterations omitted)).\n8               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nratification date was an issue for the court to decide. The\nCourt of Appeals agreed, holding that the District Court\u2019s\nrefusal to send that dispute to arbitration violated two\nprinciples of arbitrability set forth in our precedents. See\n546 F. 3d, at 1177\u22121178. The first principle is that where,\nas here, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitrate\nsome matters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the \u201claw\u2019s\npermissive policies in respect to arbitration\u201d counsel that\n\u201c \u2018 any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should\nbe resolved in favor of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d First Options, supra,\nat 945 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985)); see 546 F. 3d,\nat 1177\u22121178 (citing this principle and the \u201cnational policy\nfavoring arbitration\u201d in concluding that arbitration clauses\n\u201care to be construed very broadly\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted)). The second principle the\nCourt of Appeals invoked is that this presumption of\narbitrability applies even to disputes about the enforce\nability of the entire contract containing the arbitration\nclause, because at least in cases governed by the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.,6 courts must\ntreat the arbitration clause as severable from the contract\nin which it appears, and thus apply the clause to all dis\nputes within its scope \u201c \u2018[u]nless the [validity] challenge is\nto the arbitration clause itself\u2019 \u201d or the party \u201cdisputes the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We, like the Court of Appeals, discuss precedents applying the FAA\n\nbecause they employ the same rules of arbitrability that govern labor\ncases. See, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650. Indeed, the rule\nthat arbitration is strictly a matter of consent\u2014and thus that courts\nmust typically decide any questions concerning the formation or scope\nof an arbitration agreement before ordering parties to comply with it\u2014\nis the cornerstone of the framework the Court announced in the Steel\nworkers Trilogy for deciding arbitrability disputes in LMRA cases. See\nSteelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564, 567\u2212568 (1960);\nSteelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960);\nSteelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.

S., at 445\u2212446); 546 F. 3d, at 1177, and\nn. 4 (explaining that it would treat the parties\u2019 arbitration\nclause as enforceable with respect to the ratification-date\ndispute because no party argued that the \u201cclause is invalid\nin any way\u201d)).\n   Local contends that our precedents, particularly those\napplying the \u201c \u2018 federal policy favoring arbitration of labor\ndisputes,\u2019 \u201d permit no other result. Brief for Respondent\nLocal, p. 15 (quoting Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers,\n414 U. S. 368, 377 (1974)); see Brief for Respondent Local,\npp. 10\u201313; 16\u201325. Local, like the Court of Appeals, over\nreads our precedents. The language and holdings on\nwhich Local and the Court of Appeals rely cannot be di\nvorced from the first principle that underscores all of our\narbitration decisions: Arbitration is strictly \u201ca matter of\nconsent,\u201d Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trus\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989), and thus \u201cis a way to resolve those disputes\u2014but\nonly those disputes\u2014that the parties have agreed to sub\nmit to arbitration,\u201d First Options, 514 U. S., at 943 (em\nphasis added).7 Applying this principle, our precedents\nhold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only\nwhere the court is satisfied that neither the formation of\nthe parties\u2019 arbitration agreement nor (absent a valid\nprovision specifically committing such disputes to an\narbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute\nis in issue. Ibid. Where a party contests either or both\nmatters, \u201cthe court\u201d must resolve the disagreement. Ibid.\n   Local nonetheless interprets some of our opinions to\ndepart from this framework and to require arbitration of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See also Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.\n\n52, 57 (1995); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219\u2013\n220 (1985); Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.

TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain disputes, particularly labor disputes, based on\npolicy grounds even where evidence of the parties\u2019 agree\nment to arbitrate the dispute in question is lacking. See\nBrief for Respondent Local, p. 16 (citing cases emphasizing\nthe policy favoring arbitration generally and the \u201cimpres\nsive policy considerations favoring arbitration\u201d in LMRA\ncases (internal quotation marks omitted)). That is not a\nfair reading of the opinions, all of which compelled arbitra\ntion of a dispute only after the Court was persuaded that\nthe parties\u2019 arbitration agreement was validly formed and\nthat it covered the dispute in question and was legally\nenforceable. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at 944\u2013945.\nThat Buckeye and some of our cases applying a presump\ntion of arbitrability to certain disputes do not discuss each\nof these requirements merely reflects the fact that in those\ncases some of the requirements were so obviously satisfied\nthat no discussion was needed.\n   In Buckeye, the formation of the parties\u2019 arbitration\nagreement was not at issue because the parties agreed\nthat they had \u201cconcluded\u201d an agreement to arbitrate and\nmemorialized it as an arbitration clause in their loan\ncontract. 546 U. S., at 444, n. 1. The arbitration clause\u2019s\nscope was also not at issue, because the provision ex\npressly applied to \u201c \u2018[a]ny claim, dispute, or controversy . . .\narising from or relating to . . . the validity, enforceability,\nor scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agree\nment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 442. The parties resisting arbitration\n(customers who agreed to the broad arbitration clause as a\ncondition of using Buckeye\u2019s loan service) claimed only\nthat a usurious interest provision in the loan agreement\ninvalidated the entire contract, including the arbitration\nclause, and thus precluded the Court from relying on the\nclause as evidence of the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate\nmatters within its scope. See id., at 443. In rejecting this\nargument, we simply applied the requirement in \u00a72 of the\nFAA that courts treat an arbitration clause as severable\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

They recognize that, except where \u201cthe par\nties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,\u201d AT&T\nTechnologies, 475 U. S., at 649, it is \u201cthe court\u2019s duty to\ninterpret the agreement and to determine whether the\nparties intended to arbitrate grievances concerning\u201d a\nparticular matter, id., at 651. They then discharge this\nduty by: (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only\nwhere a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agree\nment is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at\nhand; and (2) adhering to the presumption and ordering\narbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted.\nSee id., at 651\u2013652; Prima Paint Corp., supra, at 396\u2013398;\nGateway Coal Co. v.

As noted above, see n. 6, supra, the rule is the foundation for\nthe arbitrability framework this Court announced in the Steelworkers\nTrilogy. Local\u2019s assertion that Warrior & Gulf suggests otherwise is\nmisplaced. Although Warrior & Gulf contains language that might in\nisolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor\ndisputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from\nan arbitration clause, 363 U. S., at 578\u2013582, the opinion elsewhere\n12               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption of\narbitrability we sometimes apply takes courts outside our\nsettled framework for deciding arbitrability. The pre\nsumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes\nwithin that framework. Confining the presumption to this\nrole reflects its foundation in \u201cthe federal policy favoring\narbitration.\u201d As we have explained, this \u201cpolicy\u201d is merely\nan acknowledgment of the FAA\u2019s commitment to \u201coverrule\nthe judiciary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements\nto arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same\nfooting as other contracts.\u201d Volt, 489 U. S., at 478 (inter\nnal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly,\nwe have never held that this policy overrides the principle\nthat a court may submit to arbitration \u201conly those dis\nputes . . . that the parties have agreed to submit.\u201d First\nOptions, 514 U. S., at 943; see also Mastrobuono v. Shear\nson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57 (1995) (\u201c[T]he\nFAA\u2019s proarbitration policy does not operate without\nregard to the wishes of the contract parties\u201d); AT&T Tech\nnologies, 475 U. S., at 650\u2212651 (applying the same rule to\nthe \u201cpresumption of arbitrability for labor disputes\u201d). Nor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nemphasizes that even in LMRA cases, \u201ccourts\u201d must construe arbitra\ntion clauses because \u201ca party cannot be required to submit to arbitra\ntion any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d Id., at 582\n(applying this rule and finding the dispute at issue arbitrable only after\ndetermining that the parties\u2019 arbitration clause could be construed\nunder standard principles of contract interpretation to cover it).\n   Our use of the same rules in FAA cases is also unsurprising. The\nrules are suggested by the statute itself. Section 2 of the FAA requires\ncourts to enforce valid and enforceable arbitration agreements accord\ning to their terms. And \u00a74 provides in pertinent part that where a\nparty invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court over a matter that the\ncourt could adjudicate but for the presence of an arbitration clause,\n\u201c[t]he court shall hear the parties\u201d and \u201cdirec[t] the parties to proceed\nto arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement\u201d except\n\u201c[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or\nrefusal to perform the same be in issue,\u201d in which case \u201cthe court shall\nproceed summarily to the trial thereof.\u201d 9 U.

See, e.g., id., at\n648\u2212651; Volt, supra, at 478. We have applied the pre\nsumption favoring arbitration, in FAA and in labor cases,\nonly where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a\njudicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute\nis what the parties intended because their express agree\nment to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a provi\nsion clearly and validly committing such issues to an\narbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to\nencompass the dispute. See First Options, supra, at 944\u2013\n945 (citing Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 626); Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 83\u201384; AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650 (citing\nWarrior & Gulf, supra, at 582\u2013583); Drake Bakeries, su\npra, at 259\u2013260. This simple framework compels reversal\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment because it requires\njudicial resolution of two questions central to Local\u2019s\narbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and\nwhether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local\nwishes to arbitrate.\n                             B\n  We begin by addressing the grounds on which the Court\nof Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s decision to decide\nthe parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute, which the parties\ncharacterize as a formation dispute because a union vote\nratifying the CBA\u2019s terms was necessary to form the con\ntract. See App. 351.9 For purposes of determining arbi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The parties\u2019 dispute about the CBA\u2019s ratification date presents a\n\nformation question in the sense above, and is therefore not on all fours\nwith, for example, the formation disputes we referenced in Buckeye\nCheck Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 444, n.1 (2006), which\nconcerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was \u201ccon\ncluded.\u201d That said, the manner in which the CBA\u2019s ratification date\nrelates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand makes the ratification-date\ndispute in this case one that requires judicial resolution. See infra, at\n14\u221219.\n14              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as\nwhether it was formed. That is the case where, as here,\nthe date on which an agreement was ratified determines\nthe date the agreement was formed, and thus determines\nwhether the agreement\u2019s provisions were enforceable\nduring the period relevant to the parties\u2019 dispute.10\n   This formation date question requires judicial resolution\nhere because it relates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand in\nsuch a way that the District Court was required to decide\nthe CBA\u2019s ratification date in order to determine whether\nthe parties consented to arbitrate the matters covered by\nthe demand.11 The parties agree that the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause pertains only to disputes that \u201carise under\u201d the\nagreement. Accordingly, to hold the parties\u2019 ratification\ndate dispute arbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide\nwhether that dispute could be characterized as \u201carising\nunder\u201d the CBA. In answering this question in the af\nfirmative, both Local and the Court of Appeals tied the\narbitrability of the ratification-date issue\u2014which Local\nraised as a defense to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims\u2014to the\narbitrability of the strike claims themselves. See id., at\n347. They did so because the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause,\nwhich pertains only to disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Our  conclusions about the significance of the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate to the specific arbitrability question before us do not disturb the\ngeneral rule that parties may agree to arbitrate past disputes or future\ndisputes based on past events.\n  11 In reaching this conclusion we need not, and do not, decide whether\n\nevery dispute over a CBA\u2019s ratification date would require judicial\nresolution. We recognize that ratification disputes in labor cases may\noften qualify as \u201cformation disputes\u201d for contract law purposes because\ncontract law defines formation as acceptance of an offer on specified\nterms, and in many labor cases ratification of a CBA is necessary to\nsatisfy this formation requirement. See App. 349\u2212351. But it is not the\nmere labeling of a dispute for contract law purposes that determines\nwhether an issue is arbitrable. The test for arbitrability remains\nwhether the parties consented to arbitrate the dispute in question.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand thus presupposes the CBA\u2019s existence, would seem\nplainly to cover a dispute that \u201carises under\u201d a specific\nsubstantive provision of the CBA, but does not so obvi\nously cover disputes about the CBA\u2019s own formation.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals relied upon the ratifica\ntion dispute\u2019s relationship to Granite Rock\u2019s claim that\nLocal breached the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause (a claim the\nCourt of Appeals viewed as clearly \u201carising under\u201d the\nCBA) to conclude that \u201cthe arbitration clause is certainly\n\u2018susceptible of an interpretation\u2019 that covers\u201d Local\u2019s for\nmation-date defense. 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.\n   The Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that this the\nory of the ratification dispute\u2019s arbitrability fails if the\nCBA was not formed at the time the unions engaged in the\nacts that gave rise to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims. The\nunions began their strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite\nRock filed its suit on July 9. If, as Local asserts, the CBA\ncontaining the parties\u2019 arbitration clause was not ratified,\nand thus not formed, until August 22, there was no CBA\nfor the July no-strike dispute to \u201carise under,\u201d and thus no\nvalid basis for the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Gran\nite Rock\u2019s July 9 claims arose under the CBA and were\nthus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local\u2019s formation\ndate defense to those claims.12 See ibid. For the foregoing\nreasons, resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute about whether\nthe CBA was ratified in July or August was central to\ndeciding Local\u2019s arbitration demand. Accordingly, the\nCourt of Appeals erred in holding that it was not neces\nsary for the District Court to determine the CBA\u2019s ratifica\ntion date in order to decide whether the parties agreed to\narbitrate Granite Rock\u2019s no-strike claim or the ratification\ndate dispute Local raised as a defense to that claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 This analysis pertains only to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, which\n\ndid not engage the 11th-hour retroactivity argument Local raised in its\nmerits brief in this Court, and that we address below.\n16              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Local seeks to address this flaw in the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision by arguing that in December 2004 the parties\nexecuted a document that rendered the CBA effective as of\nMay 1, 2004 (the date the prior CBA expired), and that\nthis effective-date language rendered the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause (but not its no-strike clause) applicable to the\nJuly strike period notwithstanding Local\u2019s view that the\nagreement was ratified in August (which ratification date\nLocal continues to argue controls the period during which\nthe no-strike clause applies). See Brief for Respondent\nLocal, pp. 26\u201327; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37\u221239. The Court of\nAppeals did not rule on the merits of this claim (i.e., it did\nnot decide whether the CBA\u2019s effective date language\nindeed renders some or all of the agreement\u2019s provisions\nretroactively applicable to May 2004), and we need not do\nso either. Even accepting Local\u2019s assertion that it raised\nthis retroactivity argument in the District Court, see Brief\nfor Respondent Local, p. 26,13 Local did not raise this\nargument in the Court of Appeals. Nor, more importantly,\ndid Local\u2019s brief in opposition to Granite Rock\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari raise the argument as an alternative ground on\nwhich this Court could or should affirm the Court of Ap\npeals\u2019 judgment finding the ratification-date dispute arbi\ntrable for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, the\nargument is properly \u201cdeemed waived.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2; Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 15\u221216).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 This claim is questionable because Local\u2019s February 2005 refer\n\nences to the agreement \u201cnow in effect\u201d are not obviously equivalent to\nthe express retroactivity argument Local asserts in its merits brief in\nthis Court. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 26\u221227.\n  14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s conclusion that we should nonetheless excuse\n\nLocal\u2019s waiver and consider the retroactivity argument, see post, at 5\u22126\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), is flawed. This\nCourt\u2019s Rule 15.2 reflects the fact that our adversarial system assigns\nboth sides responsibility for framing the issues in a case. The impor\ntance of enforcing the Rule is evident in cases where, as here, excusing\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                               C\n  Although the foregoing is sufficient to reverse the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 judgment, there is an additional reason to do\nso: The dispute here, whether labeled a formation dispute\nor not, falls outside the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration\nclause on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration\ncannot cure. Section 20 of the CBA provides in relevant\npart that \u201c[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall\nbe resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\u201d\nwhich includes arbitration. App. 434 (emphasis added);\nsee also id., at 434\u2013437. The parties\u2019 ratification-date\ndispute cannot properly be characterized as falling within\nthe (relatively narrow, cf., e.g., Drake Bakeries Inc., 370\nU. S., at 256\u2013257) scope of this provision for at least two\nreasons. First, we do not think the question whether the\nCBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004\u2014a question that\nconcerns the CBA\u2019s very existence\u2014can fairly be said to\n\u201carise under\u201d the CBA. Second, even if the \u201carising under\u201d\nlanguage could in isolation be construed to cover this\ndispute, Section 20\u2019s remaining provisions all but foreclose\nsuch a reading by describing that section\u2019s arbitration\nrequirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are\naddressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of\nmandatory mediation. See App. 434\u2013437 (requiring arbi\ntration of disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA, but only after\nthe Union and Employer have exhausted mandatory\nmediation, and limiting any arbitration decision under\nthis provision to those \u201cwithin the scope and terms of\nthis agreement and . . . specifically limited to the matter\nsubmitted\u201d).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na party\u2019s noncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in\nthe first instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and\nother cases in a manner that the District Court and Court of Appeals\ndid not have an opportunity to consider, and that the parties\u2019 argu\nments before this Court may not fully address.\n18            GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion does not find\nsupport in the text of \u00a720. The Court of Appeals\u2019 only\neffort to grapple with that text misses the point because it\nfocuses on whether Granite Rock\u2019s claim to enforce the\nCBA\u2019s no-strike provisions could be characterized as \u201caris\ning under\u201d the agreement. See 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.\nEven assuming that claim can be characterized as \u201carising\nunder\u201d the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is\nwhether the formation-date defense that Local raised in\nresponse to Granite Rock\u2019s no-strike suit can be character\nized as \u201carising under\u201d the CBA. It cannot for the reasons\nwe have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring\narbitration of disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA is not\nfairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came\ninto existence. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to\naddress this question and holding instead that the arbitra\ntion clause is \u201csusceptible of an interpretation\u201d that covers\nLocal\u2019s formation-date defense to Granite Rock\u2019s suit\n\u201c[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing \u2018under\u2019 the alleged new\nCBA\u201d and \u201c[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very\nbroadly.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 1178.\n                              D\n   Local\u2019s remaining argument in support of the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment is similarly unavailing. Local reiter\nates the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Granite Rock\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitration when it sued to en\nforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provi\nsions. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 17\u201318. We do\nnot agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike\nso the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave\nrise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the\nratification (formation) date dispute we address above.\nSee 564 F. 3d, at 1178. It is of course true that when\nGranite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA\n(and all of its provisions) as enforceable. But Granite\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nRock\u2019s decision to sue for compliance with the CBA\u2019s\ngrievance procedures on strike-related matters does not\nestablish an agreement, \u201cimplicit\u201d or otherwise, to arbi\ntrate an issue (the CBA\u2019s formation date) that Granite\nRock did not raise, and that Granite Rock has always (and\nrightly, see Part II\u2212C, supra) characterized as beyond the\nscope of the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause. The mere fact that\nLocal raised the formation date dispute as a defense to\nGranite Rock\u2019s suit does not make that dispute attribut\nable to Granite Rock in the waiver or estoppel sense the\nCourt of Appeals suggested, see 546 F. 3d, at 1178, much\nless establish that Granite Rock agreed to arbitrate it by\nsuing to enforce the CBA as to other matters. Accordingly,\nwe hold that the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s formation\ndate was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to re\nsolve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that\nconclusion.\n                          III\n  We turn now to the claims available on remand. The\nparties agree that Granite Rock can bring a breach-of\ncontract claim under LMRA \u00a7301(a) against Local as a\nCBA signatory, and against IBT as Local\u2019s agent or alter\nego. See Brief for Respondent IBT 10\u201313; Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 12\u201313 and n. 11.15 The question is whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Although the parties concede the general availability of such a\n\nclaim against IBT, they dispute whether Granite Rock abandoned its\nagency or alter ego allegations in the course of this litigation. Compare\nBrief for Respondent IBT, p. 10 with Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\u201313,\nn. 11. Granite Rock concedes that it has abandoned its claim that IBT\nacted as Local\u2019s undisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification\nresponse to the July 2, 2004, CBA. See Plaintiff Granite Rock\u2019s Memo\nrandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant IBT\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss in No. 5:04\u2013cv\u201302767\u2013JW (ND Cal., Aug. 7, 2006),\nDoc. 178, pp. 6, 8 (hereinafter Points and Authorities). But Granite\nRock insists that it preserved its argument that Local served as IBT\u2019s\nagent or alter ego when Local denied ratification and engaged in\n20              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nGranite Rock may also bring a federal tort claim under\n\u00a7301(a) for IBT\u2019s alleged interference with the CBA.16\nBrief for Petitioner 32. The Court of Appeals joined virtu\nally all other Circuits in holding that it would not recog\nnize such a claim under \u00a7301(a).\n   Granite Rock asks us to reject this position as inconsis\ntent with federal labor law\u2019s goal of promoting industrial\npeace and economic stability through judicial enforcement\nof CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a\nfederal common law of labor contracts is necessary to\nfurther this goal. See id., at 31; see also, e.g., Textile\nWorkers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451 (1957).\nExplaining that IBT\u2019s conduct in this case undermines the\nvery core of the bargaining relationship federal labor laws\nexist to protect, Granite Rock argues that a federal\ncommon-law tort remedy for IBT\u2019s conduct is necessary\nbecause other potential avenues for deterring and redress\ning such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333; Reply Brief for Petitioner\n19\u201320. On the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock\nlists state-law tort claims, some of which this Court has\nheld \u00a7301(a) pre-empts, as well as administrative (unfair\nlabor practices) claims, which Granite Rock says the Na\ntional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot entertain\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunauthorized strike activity in July 2004. Nothing in the record before\nus unequivocally refutes this assertion. See App. 306, 311\u2013315, 318;\nPoints and Authorities 6, n. 3. Accordingly, nothing in this opinion\nforecloses the parties from litigating these claims on remand.\n   16 IBT argues that we should dismiss this question as improvidently\n\ngranted because Granite Rock abandoned its tortious interference claim\nwhen it declared its intention to seek only contractual (as opposed to\npunitive) damages on the claim. See Brief for Respondent IBT 16. We\nreject this argument, which confuses Granite Rock\u2019s decision to forgo\nthe pursuit of punitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon\nthe claim itself. The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no author\nity for the proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than eco\nnomic damages to state a claim on which relief could be granted.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst international unions that (like IBT) are not part of\nthe certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control.\nOn the insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists\nfederal common-law breach-of-contract claims, which\nGranite Rock says are difficult to prove against non-CBA\nsignatories like IBT because international unions struc\nture their relationships with local unions in a way that\nmakes agency or alter ego difficult to establish. Based on\nthese assessments, Granite Rock suggests that this case\npresents us with the choice of either recognizing the fed\neral common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanc\ntioning conduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes\nand our own precedents. See Brief for Petitioner 13\u201314.\n   We do not believe the choice is as stark as Granite Rock\nimplies. It is of course true that we have construed \u201cSec\ntion 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of\nfederal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining\nagreements.\u201d Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 361 U. S. 459,\n470 (1960) (citing Lincoln Mills, supra). But we have also\nemphasized that in developing this common law we \u201cdid\nnot envision any freewheeling inquiry into what the fed\neral courts might find to be the most desirable rule.\u201d\nHoward Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249,\n255 (1974). The balance federal statutes strike between\nemployer and union relations in the collective-bargaining\narena is carefully calibrated, see, e.g., NLRB v. Drivers,\n362 U. S. 274, 289\u2013290 (1960), and as the parties\u2019 briefs\nillustrate, creating a federal common-law tort cause of\naction would require a host of policy choices that could\neasily upset this balance, see Brief for Respondent IBT\n42\u201344; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22\u201325. It is thus no\nsurprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held\nthat federal courts\u2019 authority to \u201ccreate a federal common\nlaw of collective bargaining agreements under section 301\u201d\nshould be confined to \u201ca common law of contracts, not a\nsource of independent rights, let alone tort rights; for\n22              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 301 is . . . a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce\ncontracts.\u201d Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6\nF. 3d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993). We see no reason for a\ndifferent result here because it would be premature to\nrecognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock re\nquests in this case even assuming that \u00a7301(a) authorizes\nus to do so.\n  In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the\nquestion before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the\nconduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but\nwhether we should augment the claims already available\nto Granite Rock by creating a new federal common-law\ncause of action under \u00a7301(a). That we decline to do so\ndoes not mean that we approve of IBT\u2019s alleged actions.\nGranite Rock describes a course of conduct that does\nindeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective\nbargaining process federal labor laws were designed to\nprotect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however,\na new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for\nthis conduct. Granite Rock\u2019s allegations have prompted\nfavorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also\nfrom the NLRB. In proceedings that predated those in\nwhich the District Court entered judgment for Granite\nRock on the CBA\u2019s formation date,17 the NLRB concluded\nthat a \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d was reached on July 2, and\nthat Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempt\ning to delay the CBA\u2019s ratification pending execution of a\nseparate agreement favorable to IBT. See In re Teamsters\nLocal 287, 347 N. L. R. B. 339, 340\u2013341, and n. 1 (2006)\n(applying the remedial order on the 2004 conduct to both\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Although the Board and federal jury reached different conclusions\n\nwith respect to the CBA\u2019s ratification date, the discrepancy has little\npractical significance because the Board\u2019s remedial order against Local\nand IBT gives \u201cretroactive effect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2,\n2004, as if ratified on that date.\u201d In re Teamsters Local 287, 347\nN.

Notably,\nGranite Rock (like IBT and the Court of Appeals) assumes\nthat federal common law provides the only possible basis\nfor the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue. See Brief for\nRespondent IBT 33\u201334; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But\nGranite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not\npresent us with occasion to address, whether state law\nmight provide a remedy. See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Raw\nson, 495 U. S. 362, 369\u2212371 (1990); Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U. S. 653, 656, 658 (1998). Nor did Granite\nRock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administra\ntive causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy\nIBT\u2019s conduct. For example, far from establishing that an\nagency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccess\nful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to\nprove than usual if, as the NLRB\u2019s decision observes, IBT\nand Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to\nGranite Rock\u2019s claims. See In re Teamsters Local 287,\nsupra, at 340, n. 6. Similarly, neither party has estab\nlished that the Board itself could not issue additional\nrelief against IBT. IBT\u2019s amici argue that the \u201coverlap\nbetween Granite Rock\u2019s \u00a7301 claim against the IBT and\nthe NLRB General Counsel\u2019s unfair labor practice com\nplaint against Local 287 brings into play the National\nLabor Relations Act rule that an international union\ncommits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated\nlocal unions to \u2018impose extraneous non-bargaining unit\n24            GRANITE ROCK CO. v.

S. C.\n\u00a7185(a). I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that the arbitration provision in the collective\nbargaining agreement (CBA) between Granite Rock and\nIBT Local 287 does not cover the parties\u2019 dispute over\nwhether Local 287 breached the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause.\nIn my judgment, the parties clearly agreed in the CBA to\nhave this dispute resolved by an arbitrator, not a court.\n   The legal principles that govern this case are simpler\nthan the Court\u2019s exposition suggests. Arbitration, all\nagree, \u201cis a matter of contract and a party cannot be re\nquired to submit to arbitration any dispute which [it] has\nnot agreed so to submit.\u201d Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf\nNav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960). Before ordering par\nties to arbitrate, a court must therefore confirm (1) that\nthe parties have an agreement to arbitrate and (2) that\nthe agreement covers their dispute. See ante, at 9. In\ndetermining the scope of an arbitration agreement, \u201cthere\n2                GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nis a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that \u2018[a]n\norder to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be\ndenied unless it may be said with positive assurance that\nthe arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpreta\ntion that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be\nresolved in favor of coverage.\u2019 \u201d AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.\nCommunications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 650 (1986) (quot\ning Warrior, 363 U.

The parties made the CBA retro\nactively \u201ceffect[ive] from May 1, 2004,\u201d the day after the\nexpiration of their prior collective-bargaining agreement.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013190.

In other words, \u201c[u]nless\nthe parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,\u201d it is presumed\nthat courts, not arbitrators, are responsible for resolving antecedent\nquestions concerning the scope of an arbitration agreement. AT&T\nTechnologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649\n(1986). As the majority correctly observes, ante, at 7, n. 5, this case\ndoes not implicate the reversed presumption because both parties\naccept that a court, not an arbitrator, should resolve their current\ndisagreement about whether their underlying dispute is arbitrable.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at\nA\u2013176 to A\u2013179.\n   Granite Rock claims that Local 287 breached the CBA\u2019s\nno-strike clause by engaging in a work stoppage in July\n2004. Local 287 contests this claim. Specifically, it con\ntends that it had no duty to abide by the no-strike clause\nin July because it did not vote to ratify the CBA until\nAugust. As I see it, the parties\u2019 disagreement as to\nwhether the no-strike clause proscribed the July work\nstoppage is plainly a \u201cdisput[e] arising under\u201d the CBA\nand is therefore subject to arbitration as Local 287 de\nmands. Indeed, the parties\u2019 no-strike dispute is indistin\nguishable from myriad other disputes that an employer\nand union might have concerning the interpretation and\napplication of the substantive provisions of a collective\nbargaining agreement. These are precisely the sorts of\ncontroversies that labor arbitrators are called upon to\nresolve every day.\n   The majority seems to agree that the CBA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision generally encompasses disputes between Gran\nite Rock and Local 287 regarding the parties\u2019 compliance\nwith the terms of the CBA, including the no-strike clause.\nThe majority contends, however, that Local 287\u2019s \u201cforma\ntion-date defense\u201d raises a preliminary question of con\ntract formation that must be resolved by a court rather\nthan an arbitrator. Ante, at 15. The majority\u2019s reasoning\nappears to be the following: If Local 287 did not ratify the\nCBA until August, then there is \u201cno valid basis\u201d for apply\ning the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision to events that occurred\nin July. Ibid.\n   The majority\u2019s position is flatly inconsistent with the\nlanguage of the CBA. The parties expressly chose to make\nthe agreement effective from May 1, 2004. As a result,\n\u201cthe date on which [the] agreement was ratified\u201d does not,\nas the majority contends, determine whether the parties\u2019\ndispute about the permissibility of the July work stoppage\n4               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nfalls within the scope of the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision.\nAnte, at 14. When it comes to answering the arbitrability\nquestion, it is entirely irrelevant whether Local 287 rati\nfied the CBA in August (as it contends) or in July (as\nGranite Rock contends). In either case, the parties\u2019 dis\npute\u2014which postdates May 1\u2014clearly \u201caris[es] under\u201d the\nCBA, which is all the arbitration provision requires to\nmake a dispute referable to an arbitrator. Cf. Litton\nFinancial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 201 (1991) (recognizing that \u201ca\ncollective-bargaining agreement might be drafted so as to\neliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and\nexecution of the new agreement\u201d).2\n   Given the CBA\u2019s express retroactivity, the majority errs\nin treating Local 287\u2019s ratification-date defense as a \u201cfor\nmation dispute\u201d subject to judicial resolution. Ante, at 13.\nThe defense simply goes to the merits of Granite Rock\u2019s\nclaim: Local 287 maintains that the no-strike clause\nshould not be construed to apply to the July work stoppage\nbecause it had not ratified the CBA at the time of that\naction. Cf. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\nU. S. 938, 942 (1995) (distinguishing a disagreement that\n\u201cmakes up the merits of the dispute\u201d from a disagreement\n\u201cabout the arbitrability of the dispute\u201d). Accordingly, the\ndefense is necessarily a matter for the arbitrator, not the\ncourt. See AT&T, 475 U. S., at 651 (\u201c[I]t is for the arbitra\ntor to determine the relative merits of the parties\u2019 sub\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Notably, at the time they executed the CBA in December 2004, the\n\nparties were well aware that they disagreed about the legitimacy of the\nJuly work stoppage. Yet they made the CBA retroactive to May and\ndeclined to carve out their no-strike dispute from the arbitration\nprovision, despite expressly excluding three other classes of disputes\nfrom arbitration. Cf. Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363\nU. S. 574, 584\u2013585 (1960) (\u201cIn the absence of any express provision\nexcluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think only the\nmost forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitra\ntion can prevail\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Indeed, this\nCourt has been emphatic that \u201ccourts . . . have no business\nweighing the merits of the grievance.\u201d Steelworkers v.\nAmerican Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564, 568 (1960). \u201cWhen the\njudiciary undertakes to determine the merits of a griev\nance under the guise of interpreting the [arbitration provi\nsions] of collective bargaining agreements, it usurps a\nfunction . . . entrusted to the arbitration tribunal.\u201d Id., at\n569; see also AT&T, 475 U. S., at 649 (\u201c[I]n deciding\nwhether the parties have agreed to submit a particular\ngrievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the po\ntential merits of the underlying claims\u201d); Warrior, 363\nU.

See ante, at 16. As a result of Local\n287\u2019s omission, the District Court and Court of Appeals\nproceeded under the understanding that this case pre\nsented a formation question. It was not until its merits\nbrief in this Court that Local 287 attempted to correct this\nmistaken premise by pointing to the parties\u2019 execution of\nthe December 2004 CBA with its May 2004 effective date.\nThis Court\u2019s rules \u201cadmonis[h] [counsel] that they have an\nobligation to the Court to point out in the brief in opposi\ntion [to certiorari], and not later, any perceived misstate\nment made in the petition [for certiorari]\u201d; nonjurisdic\ntional arguments not raised at that time \u201cmay be deemed\nwaived.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule 15.2. Although it is regretta\nble and inexcusable that Local 287 did not present its\n6             GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nargument earlier, I do not see it as one we can ignore. The\nquestion presented in this case presupposes that \u201cit is\ndisputed whether any binding contract exists.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner i. Because it is instead undisputed that the\nparties executed a binding contract in December 2004 that\nwas effective as of May 2004, we can scarcely pretend that\nthe parties have a formation dispute. Consideration of\nthis fact is \u201ca \u2018predicate to an intelligent resolution\u2019 of the\nquestion presented, and therefore \u2018fairly included\ntherein.\u2019 \u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (quot\ning Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258, n. 5 (1980); this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 14.1(a)). Indeed, by declining to consider the\nplain terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, the majority offers\nlittle more than \u201can opinion advising what the law would\nbe upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co.\nv. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 241 (1937). In view of the\nCBA\u2019s effective date, I would hold that the parties agreed\nto arbitrate the no-strike dispute, including Local 287\u2019s\nratification-date defense, and I would affirm the judgment\nbelow on this alternative ground.

INTERNATIONAL BROTHER-\n          HOOD OF TEAMSTERS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u20131214. Argued January 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nIn June 2004, respondent local union (Local), supported by its parent\n  international (IBT), initiated a strike against petitioner Granite\n  Rock, the employer of some of Local\u2019s members, following the expira\n  tion of the parties\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and an im\n  passe in their negotiations. On July 2, the parties agreed to a new\n  CBA containing no-strike and arbitration clauses, but could not reach\n  a separate back-to-work agreement holding local and international\n  union members harmless for any strike-related damages Granite\n  Rock incurred. IBT instructed Local to continue striking until Gran\n  ite Rock approved such a hold-harmless agreement, but the company\n  refused to do so, informing Local that continued strike activity would\n  violate the new CBA\u2019s no-strike clause. IBT and Local responded by\n  announcing a company-wide strike involving numerous facilities and\n  workers, including members of other IBT locals.\n     Granite Rock sued IBT and Local, invoking federal jurisdiction\n  under \u00a7301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA),\n  seeking strike-related damages for the unions\u2019 alleged breach of con\n  tract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because\n  the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new\n  CBA. The unions conceded \u00a7301(a) jurisdiction, but asserted that the\n  new CBA was never validly ratified by a vote of Local\u2019s members,\n  and, thus, the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause did not provide a basis for\n  Granite Rock to challenge the strike. After Granite Rock amended\n  its complaint to add claims that IBT tortiously interfered with the\n  new CBA, the unions moved to dismiss. The District Court granted\n  IBT\u2019s motion to dismiss the tortious interference claims on the\n  ground that \u00a7301(a) supports a federal cause of action only for breach\n2                 GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of contract. But the court denied Local\u2019s separate motion to send the\n    parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date to arbitration, ruling\n    that a jury should decide whether ratification occurred on July 2, as\n    Granite Rock contended, or on August 22, as Local alleged. After the\n    jury concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, the court ordered\n    arbitration to proceed on Granite Rock\u2019s breach-of-contract claims.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the tortious interference\n    claims, but reversed the arbitration order, holding that the parties\u2019\n    ratification-date dispute was a matter for an arbitrator to resolve un\n    der the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause. The Court of Appeals reasoned that\n    the clause covered the ratification-date dispute because the clause\n    clearly covered the related strike claims; national policy favoring ar\n    bitration required ambiguity about the arbitration clause\u2019s scope to\n    be resolved in favor of arbitrability; and, in any event, Granite Rock\n    had implicitly consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute by\n    suing under the contract.\nHeld:\n    1. The parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date was a mat\n ter for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve. Pp. 6\u201320.\n       (a) Whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute\n is typically an \u201c \u2018 issue for judicial determination,\u2019 \u201d e.g., Howsam v.\n Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83, as is a dispute over an\n arbitration contract\u2019s formation, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago,\n Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944. These principles would neatly\n dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical. But it\n is not. It is based on when (not whether) the new CBA containing the\n parties\u2019 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed. To de\n termine whether the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date\n is arbitrable, it is necessary to apply the rule that a court may order\n arbitration of a particular dispute only when satisfied that the par\n ties agreed to arbitrate that dispute. See, e.g., id., at 943. To satisfy\n itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue\n that calls into question the specific arbitration clause that a party\n seeks to have the court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\n Jackson, ante, at 4\u20136. Absent an agreement committing them to an\n arbitrator, such issues typically concern the scope and enforceability\n of the parties\u2019 arbitration clause. In addition, such issues always in\n clude whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that\n agreement was formed. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) In cases invoking the \u201cfederal policy favoring arbitration of\n labor disputes,\u201d Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368,\n 377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, e.g., AT&T Technolo\n gies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, and discharge\n their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nparticular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability\nonly where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is\nambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) order\ning arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, e.g.,\nid., at 651\u2013652. Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption\ntakes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitra\nbility. This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the\nprinciple that a court may submit to arbitration \u201conly those disputes\n. . . the parties have agreed to submit,\u201d First Options, supra, at 943,\nnor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for\nparty agreement, see, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648\u2212651.\nThe presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives\nits legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly\ncommitting the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular\ndispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement\nto arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best con\nstrued to encompass the dispute. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at\n944\u2013945. This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Cir\ncuit\u2019s judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related\nquestions central to Local\u2019s arbitration demand: when the CBA was\nformed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local\nwishes to arbitrate. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a\nformation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA\u2019s terms\nwas necessary to form the contract. For purposes of determining ar\nbitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it\nwas formed. That is so where, as here, an agreement\u2019s ratification\ndate determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its\nprovisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties\u2019\ndispute. This formation date question requires judicial resolution\nhere because it relates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand in a way that\nrequired the District Court to determine the CBA\u2019s ratification date\nin order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the mat\nters the demand covered. The CBA requires arbitration only of dis\nputes that \u201carise under\u201d the agreement. The parties\u2019 ratification-date\ndispute does not clearly fit that description. But the Ninth Circuit\ncredited Local\u2019s argument that the ratification-date dispute should be\npresumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dis\npute) that does clearly \u201carise under\u201d the CBA. The Ninth Circuit\noverlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date dispute\u2019s\narbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed\nuntil August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July\nno-strike dispute to \u201carise under.\u201d Local attempts to address this\nflaw in the Circuit\u2019s reasoning by arguing that a December 2004\n4                 GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of\n    May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired. The Court of Appeals\n    did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either be\n    cause it was not raised in Local\u2019s brief in opposition to the certiorari\n    petition. Pp. 13\u201317.\n          (d) Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is\n    that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dis\n    pute or not, falls outside the arbitration clause\u2019s scope on grounds the\n    presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure. CBA \u00a720 provides, in\n    ter alia, that \u201c[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be re\n    solved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\u201d which includes\n    arbitration. The parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute cannot properly be\n    said to fall within this provision\u2019s scope for at least two reasons.\n    First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2,\n    2004\u2014a question concerning the CBA\u2019s very existence\u2014cannot fairly\n    be said to \u201carise under\u201d the CBA. Second, even if the \u201carising under\u201d\n    language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, \u00a720\u2019s\n    remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing\n    that section\u2019s arbitration requirement as applicable to labor dis\n    agreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its re\n    quirement of mandatory mediation. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary\n    conclusion finds no support in \u00a720\u2019s text. That court\u2019s only effort to\n    grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Gran\n    ite Rock\u2019s claim to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike provisions could be\n    characterized as \u201carising under\u201d the agreement, which is not the dis\n    positive issue here. Pp. 17\u201318.\n          (e) Local\u2019s remaining argument in support of the Court of Ap\n    peals\u2019 judgment\u2014that Granite Rock \u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitra\n    tion when it sued to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike and arbitrable griev\n    ance provisions\u2014is similarly unavailing. Although it sought an\n    injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor\n    grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rock\u2019s decision to sue does not es\n    tablish an agreement, \u201cimplicit\u201d or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue\n    (the CBA\u2019s formation date) that the company did not raise and has\n    always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clause\u2019s scope.\n    Pp. 19\u201320.\n       2. The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new fed\n    eral common-law cause of action under LMRA \u00a7301(a) for IBT\u2019s al\n    leged tortious interference with the CBA. Though virtually all other\n    Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so\n    in this case is inconsistent with federal labor law\u2019s goal of promoting\n    industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement\n    of CBAs, and with this Court\u2019s precedents holding that a federal\n    common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see,\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The\n  company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other poten\n  tial avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims,\n  unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations\n  Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims,\n  are either unavailable or insufficient. But Granite Rock has not yet\n  exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide\n  an opportunity to judge their efficacy. Accordingly, it would be pre\n  mature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even as\n  suming \u00a7301(a) authorizes this Court to do so. That is particularly\n  true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already\n  prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below\n  and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the union\u2019s\n  attempts to delay the new CBA\u2019s ratification. Those proceedings, and\n  others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Gran\n  ite Rock\u2019s assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief\n  are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declin\n  ing to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.

The claims turn in\npart on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)\ncontaining a no-strike provision was validly formed during\nthe strike period. The employer contends that it was,\nwhile the unions contend that it was not. Because the\nCBA contains an arbitration clause, we first address\nwhether the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate was a matter for the District Court or an arbitrator to\nresolve. We conclude that it was a matter for judicial\nresolution. Next, we address whether the Court of Ap\npeals erred in declining the employer\u2019s request to recog\nnize a new federal cause of action under \u00a7301(a) of the\nLabor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat.\n156, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7185(a), for the international union\u2019s\nalleged tortious interference with the CBA. The Court of\nAppeals did not err in declining this request.\n2               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n   Petitioner Granite Rock Company is a concrete and\nbuilding materials company that has operated in Califor\nnia since 1900. Granite Rock employs approximately 800\nemployees under different labor contracts with several\nunions, including respondent International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters, Local 287 (Local). Granite Rock and Local\nwere parties to a 1999 CBA that expired in April 2004.\nThe parties\u2019 attempt to negotiate a new CBA hit an im\npasse and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a\nstrike in support of their contract demands.1\n   The strike continued until July 2, 2004, when the par\nties reached agreement on the terms of a new CBA. The\nCBA contained a no-strike clause but did not directly\naddress union members\u2019 liability for any strike-related\ndamages Granite Rock may have incurred before the new\nCBA was negotiated but after the prior CBA had expired.\nAt the end of the negotiating session on the new CBA,\nLocal\u2019s business representative, George Netto, approached\nGranite Rock about executing a separate \u201cback-to-work\u201d\nagreement that would, among other things, hold union\nmembers harmless for damages incurred during the June\n2004 strike. Netto did not make execution of such an\nagreement a condition of Local\u2019s ratification of the CBA, or\nof Local\u2019s decision to cease picketing. Thus, Local did not\nhave a back-to-work or hold-harmless agreement in place\nwhen it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2, 2004.\n   Respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n(IBT), which had advised Local throughout the CBA nego\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In deciding the arbitration question in this case we rely upon the\n\nterms of the CBA and the facts in the District Court record. In review\ning the judgment affirming dismissal of Granite Rock\u2019s tort claims\nagainst respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) for\nfailure to state a claim, we rely on the facts alleged in Granite Rock\u2019s\nThird Amended Complaint. See, e.g., H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell\nTelephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 250 (1989).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntiations and whose leadership and members supported the\nJune strike, opposed Local\u2019s decision to return to work\nwithout a back-to-work agreement shielding both Local\nand IBT members from liability for strike-related dam\nages. In an effort to secure such an agreement, IBT in\nstructed Local\u2019s members not to honor their agreement to\nreturn to work on July 5, and instructed Local\u2019s leaders to\ncontinue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to\nhold Local and IBT members free from liability for the\nJune strike. Netto demanded such an agreement on July\n6, but Granite Rock refused the request and informed\nLocal that the company would view any continued strike\nactivity as a violation of the new CBA\u2019s no-strike clause.\nIBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide\nstrike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds of\nworkers, including members of IBT locals besides Local\n287.\n   According to Granite Rock, IBT not only instigated this\nstrike; it supported and directed it. IBT provided pay and\nbenefits to union members who refused to return to work,\ndirected Local\u2019s negotiations with Granite Rock, supported\nLocal financially during the strike period with a $1.2\nmillion loan, and represented to Granite Rock that IBT\nhad unilateral authority to end the work stoppage in\nexchange for a hold-harmless agreement covering IBT\nmembers within and outside Local\u2019s bargaining unit.\n   On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and Local in\nthe District Court, seeking an injunction against the\nongoing strike and strike-related damages. Granite Rock\u2019s\ncomplaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal\njurisdiction under LMRA \u00a7301(a), alleged that the July 6\nstrike violated Local\u2019s obligations under the CBA\u2019s no\nstrike provision, and asked the District Court to enjoin the\nstrike because the hold-harmless dispute giving rise to the\nstrike was an arbitrable grievance. See Boys Markets, Inc.\nv. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 237\u2013238, 253\u2013254 (1970)\n4               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike where a\nCBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occa\nsions the strike). The unions conceded that LMRA \u00a7301(a)\ngave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but op\nposed Granite Rock\u2019s complaint, asserting that the CBA\nwas not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time\nrelevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike\nclause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock\u2019s claims\nchallenging the strike.\n   The District Court initially denied Granite Rock\u2019s re\nquest to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike provision because\nGranite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the\nCBA was ratified on July 2. App. 203\u2013213. Shortly after\nthe District Court ruled, however, a Local member testi\nfied that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote\non July 2, and that the voting Local members unani\nmously approved the agreement. Based on this statement\nand supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Gran\nite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and dam\nages claims.\n   On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local\nconducted a second successful \u201cratification\u201d vote on the\nCBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was\nscheduled to hear Granite Rock\u2019s motion, the unions called\noff their strike. Although their return to work mooted\nGranite Rock\u2019s request for an injunction, the District\nCourt proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite\nRock a new trial on its damages claims. The parties pro\nceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its\ncomplaint, which already alleged federal2 claims for\nbreach of the CBA against both Local and IBT, to add\nfederal inducement of breach and interference with con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 This Court has recognized a federal common-law claim for breach of\n\na CBA under LMRA \u00a7301(a). See, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills\nof Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 456 (1957).\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntract (hereinafter tortious interference) claims against\nIBT.\n   IBT and Local both moved to dismiss. Among other\nthings, IBT argued that Granite Rock could not plead a\nfederal tort claim under \u00a7301(a) because that provision\nsupports a federal cause of action only for breach of con\ntract. The District Court agreed and dismissed Granite\nRock\u2019s tortious interference claims. The District Court did\nnot, however, grant Local\u2019s separate motion to send the\nparties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification date to arbitra\ntion.3 The District Court held that whether the CBA was\nratified on July 2 or August 22 was an issue for the court\nto decide, and submitted the question to a jury. The jury\nreached a unanimous verdict that Local ratified the CBA\non July 2, 2004. The District Court entered the verdict\nand ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration on\nGranite Rock\u2019s breach-of-contract claims for strike-related\ndamages.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. See 546 F. 3d 1169 (2008). The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of\nGranite Rock\u2019s tortious interference claims against IBT.\nSee id., at 1170\u20131175. But it disagreed with the District\nCourt\u2019s determination that the date of the CBA\u2019s ratifica\ntion was a matter for judicial resolution. See id., at 1176\u2013\n1178. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the parties\u2019\ndispute over this issue was governed by the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause because the clause clearly covered the related\nstrike claims, the \u201cnational policy favoring arbitration\u201d\nrequired that any ambiguity about the scope of the parties\u2019\narbitration clause be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The CBA\u2019s ratification date is important to Granite Rock\u2019s underly\n\ning suit for strike damages. If the District Court correctly concluded\nthat the CBA was ratified on July 2, Granite Rock could argue on\nremand that the July work stoppage violated the CBA\u2019s no-strike\nclause.\n6             GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin any event, Granite Rock had \u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to\narbitrate the ratification-date dispute \u201cby suing under the\ncontract.\u201d Id., at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                                II\n   It is well settled in both commercial and labor cases that\nwhether parties have agreed to \u201csubmi[t] a particular\ndispute to arbitration\u201d is typically an \u201c \u2018 issue for judicial\ndetermination.\u2019 \u201d Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002) (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc.\nv. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986));\nsee John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543,\n546\u2013547 (1964). It is similarly well settled that where the\ndispute at issue concerns contract formation, the dispute\nis generally for courts to decide. See, e.g., First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995) (\u201cWhen\ndeciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain\nmatter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary . . .\nprinciples that govern the formation of contracts\u201d); AT&T\nTechnologies, supra, at 648\u2212649 (explaining the settled\nrule in labor cases that \u201c \u2018arbitration is a matter of con\ntract\u2019 \u201d and \u201carbitrators derive their authority to resolve\ndisputes only because the parties have agreed in advance\nto submit such grievances to arbitration\u201d); Buckeye Check\nCashing, Inc. v.

But it is not. It is\nbased on when (not whether) the CBA that contains the\nparties\u2019 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Under that framework, a court\nmay order arbitration of a particular dispute only where\nthe court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate\nthat dispute. See First Options, supra, at 943; AT&T\nTechnologies, supra, at 648\u2212649. To satisfy itself that\nsuch agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue\nthat calls into question the formation or applicability of\nthe specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have\nthe court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\nJackson, ante, at 4\u22126 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Where there\nis no provision validly committing them to an arbitrator,\nsee ante, at 7, these issues typically concern the scope of\nthe arbitration clause and its enforceability. In addition,\nthese issues always include whether the clause was agreed\nto, and may include when that agreement was formed.\n                           A\n  The parties agree that it was proper for the District\nCourt to decide whether their ratification dispute was\narbitrable.5 They disagree about whether the District\nCourt answered the question correctly. Local contends\nthat the District Court erred in holding that the CBA\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Although a union ratification vote is not always required for the\n\nprovisions in a CBA to be considered validly formed, the parties agree\nthat ratification was such a predicate here. See App. 349\u2013351.\n  5 Because neither party argues that the arbitrator should decide this\n\nquestion, there is no need to apply the rule requiring \u201c \u2018clear and\nunmistakable\u2019 \u201d evidence of an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability.\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995)\n(quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475\nU. S. 643, 649 (1986) (alterations omitted)).\n8               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nratification date was an issue for the court to decide. The\nCourt of Appeals agreed, holding that the District Court\u2019s\nrefusal to send that dispute to arbitration violated two\nprinciples of arbitrability set forth in our precedents. See\n546 F. 3d, at 1177\u22121178. The first principle is that where,\nas here, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitrate\nsome matters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the \u201claw\u2019s\npermissive policies in respect to arbitration\u201d counsel that\n\u201c \u2018 any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should\nbe resolved in favor of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d First Options, supra,\nat 945 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985)); see 546 F. 3d,\nat 1177\u22121178 (citing this principle and the \u201cnational policy\nfavoring arbitration\u201d in concluding that arbitration clauses\n\u201care to be construed very broadly\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted)). The second principle the\nCourt of Appeals invoked is that this presumption of\narbitrability applies even to disputes about the enforce\nability of the entire contract containing the arbitration\nclause, because at least in cases governed by the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.,6 courts must\ntreat the arbitration clause as severable from the contract\nin which it appears, and thus apply the clause to all dis\nputes within its scope \u201c \u2018[u]nless the [validity] challenge is\nto the arbitration clause itself\u2019 \u201d or the party \u201cdisputes the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We, like the Court of Appeals, discuss precedents applying the FAA\n\nbecause they employ the same rules of arbitrability that govern labor\ncases. See, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650. Indeed, the rule\nthat arbitration is strictly a matter of consent\u2014and thus that courts\nmust typically decide any questions concerning the formation or scope\nof an arbitration agreement before ordering parties to comply with it\u2014\nis the cornerstone of the framework the Court announced in the Steel\nworkers Trilogy for deciding arbitrability disputes in LMRA cases.

Board of Trus\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989), and thus \u201cis a way to resolve those disputes\u2014but\nonly those disputes\u2014that the parties have agreed to sub\nmit to arbitration,\u201d First Options, 514 U. S., at 943 (em\nphasis added).7 Applying this principle, our precedents\nhold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only\nwhere the court is satisfied that neither the formation of\nthe parties\u2019 arbitration agreement nor (absent a valid\nprovision specifically committing such disputes to an\narbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute\nis in issue. Ibid. Where a party contests either or both\nmatters, \u201cthe court\u201d must resolve the disagreement. Ibid.\n   Local nonetheless interprets some of our opinions to\ndepart from this framework and to require arbitration of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See also Mastrobuono v.

TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain disputes, particularly labor disputes, based on\npolicy grounds even where evidence of the parties\u2019 agree\nment to arbitrate the dispute in question is lacking. See\nBrief for Respondent Local, p. 16 (citing cases emphasizing\nthe policy favoring arbitration generally and the \u201cimpres\nsive policy considerations favoring arbitration\u201d in LMRA\ncases (internal quotation marks omitted)). That is not a\nfair reading of the opinions, all of which compelled arbitra\ntion of a dispute only after the Court was persuaded that\nthe parties\u2019 arbitration agreement was validly formed and\nthat it covered the dispute in question and was legally\nenforceable. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at 944\u2013945.\nThat Buckeye and some of our cases applying a presump\ntion of arbitrability to certain disputes do not discuss each\nof these requirements merely reflects the fact that in those\ncases some of the requirements were so obviously satisfied\nthat no discussion was needed.\n   In Buckeye, the formation of the parties\u2019 arbitration\nagreement was not at issue because the parties agreed\nthat they had \u201cconcluded\u201d an agreement to arbitrate and\nmemorialized it as an arbitration clause in their loan\ncontract. 546 U. S., at 444, n. 1. The arbitration clause\u2019s\nscope was also not at issue, because the provision ex\npressly applied to \u201c \u2018[a]ny claim, dispute, or controversy . . .\narising from or relating to . . . the validity, enforceability,\nor scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agree\nment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 442. The parties resisting arbitration\n(customers who agreed to the broad arbitration clause as a\ncondition of using Buckeye\u2019s loan service) claimed only\nthat a usurious interest provision in the loan agreement\ninvalidated the entire contract, including the arbitration\nclause, and thus precluded the Court from relying on the\nclause as evidence of the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate\nmatters within its scope. See id., at 443. In rejecting this\nargument, we simply applied the requirement in \u00a72 of the\nFAA that courts treat an arbitration clause as severable\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

They recognize that, except where \u201cthe par\nties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,\u201d AT&T\nTechnologies, 475 U.

They then discharge this\nduty by: (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only\nwhere a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agree\nment is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at\nhand; and (2) adhering to the presumption and ordering\narbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted.\nSee id., at 651\u2013652; Prima Paint Corp., supra, at 396\u2013398;\nGateway Coal Co. v.

As noted above, see n. 6, supra, the rule is the foundation for\nthe arbitrability framework this Court announced in the Steelworkers\nTrilogy. Local\u2019s assertion that Warrior & Gulf suggests otherwise is\nmisplaced. Although Warrior & Gulf contains language that might in\nisolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor\ndisputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from\nan arbitration clause, 363 U. S., at 578\u2013582, the opinion elsewhere\n12               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption of\narbitrability we sometimes apply takes courts outside our\nsettled framework for deciding arbitrability. The pre\nsumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes\nwithin that framework. Confining the presumption to this\nrole reflects its foundation in \u201cthe federal policy favoring\narbitration.\u201d As we have explained, this \u201cpolicy\u201d is merely\nan acknowledgment of the FAA\u2019s commitment to \u201coverrule\nthe judiciary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements\nto arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same\nfooting as other contracts.\u201d Volt, 489 U. S., at 478 (inter\nnal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly,\nwe have never held that this policy overrides the principle\nthat a court may submit to arbitration \u201conly those dis\nputes . . . that the parties have agreed to submit.\u201d First\nOptions, 514 U. S., at 943; see also Mastrobuono v. Shear\nson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57 (1995) (\u201c[T]he\nFAA\u2019s proarbitration policy does not operate without\nregard to the wishes of the contract parties\u201d); AT&T Tech\nnologies, 475 U. S., at 650\u2212651 (applying the same rule to\nthe \u201cpresumption of arbitrability for labor disputes\u201d). Nor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nemphasizes that even in LMRA cases, \u201ccourts\u201d must construe arbitra\ntion clauses because \u201ca party cannot be required to submit to arbitra\ntion any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d Id., at 582\n(applying this rule and finding the dispute at issue arbitrable only after\ndetermining that the parties\u2019 arbitration clause could be construed\nunder standard principles of contract interpretation to cover it).\n   Our use of the same rules in FAA cases is also unsurprising. The\nrules are suggested by the statute itself. Section 2 of the FAA requires\ncourts to enforce valid and enforceable arbitration agreements accord\ning to their terms. And \u00a74 provides in pertinent part that where a\nparty invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court over a matter that the\ncourt could adjudicate but for the presence of an arbitration clause,\n\u201c[t]he court shall hear the parties\u201d and \u201cdirec[t] the parties to proceed\nto arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement\u201d except\n\u201c[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or\nrefusal to perform the same be in issue,\u201d in which case \u201cthe court shall\nproceed summarily to the trial thereof.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave we held that courts may use policy considerations as\na substitute for party agreement.         See, e.g., id., at\n648\u2212651; Volt, supra, at 478. We have applied the pre\nsumption favoring arbitration, in FAA and in labor cases,\nonly where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a\njudicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute\nis what the parties intended because their express agree\nment to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a provi\nsion clearly and validly committing such issues to an\narbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to\nencompass the dispute. See First Options, supra, at 944\u2013\n945 (citing Mitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 626); Howsam, 537\nU. S., at 83\u201384; AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650 (citing\nWarrior & Gulf, supra, at 582\u2013583); Drake Bakeries, su\npra, at 259\u2013260. This simple framework compels reversal\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment because it requires\njudicial resolution of two questions central to Local\u2019s\narbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and\nwhether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local\nwishes to arbitrate.\n                             B\n  We begin by addressing the grounds on which the Court\nof Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s decision to decide\nthe parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute, which the parties\ncharacterize as a formation dispute because a union vote\nratifying the CBA\u2019s terms was necessary to form the con\ntract. See App. 351.9 For purposes of determining arbi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The parties\u2019 dispute about the CBA\u2019s ratification date presents a\n\nformation question in the sense above, and is therefore not on all fours\nwith, for example, the formation disputes we referenced in Buckeye\nCheck Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 444, n.1 (2006), which\nconcerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was \u201ccon\ncluded.\u201d That said, the manner in which the CBA\u2019s ratification date\nrelates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand makes the ratification-date\ndispute in this case one that requires judicial resolution. See infra, at\n14\u221219.\n14              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as\nwhether it was formed. That is the case where, as here,\nthe date on which an agreement was ratified determines\nthe date the agreement was formed, and thus determines\nwhether the agreement\u2019s provisions were enforceable\nduring the period relevant to the parties\u2019 dispute.10\n   This formation date question requires judicial resolution\nhere because it relates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand in\nsuch a way that the District Court was required to decide\nthe CBA\u2019s ratification date in order to determine whether\nthe parties consented to arbitrate the matters covered by\nthe demand.11 The parties agree that the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause pertains only to disputes that \u201carise under\u201d the\nagreement. Accordingly, to hold the parties\u2019 ratification\ndate dispute arbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide\nwhether that dispute could be characterized as \u201carising\nunder\u201d the CBA. In answering this question in the af\nfirmative, both Local and the Court of Appeals tied the\narbitrability of the ratification-date issue\u2014which Local\nraised as a defense to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims\u2014to the\narbitrability of the strike claims themselves. See id., at\n347. They did so because the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause,\nwhich pertains only to disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Our  conclusions about the significance of the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate to the specific arbitrability question before us do not disturb the\ngeneral rule that parties may agree to arbitrate past disputes or future\ndisputes based on past events.\n  11 In reaching this conclusion we need not, and do not, decide whether\n\nevery dispute over a CBA\u2019s ratification date would require judicial\nresolution. We recognize that ratification disputes in labor cases may\noften qualify as \u201cformation disputes\u201d for contract law purposes because\ncontract law defines formation as acceptance of an offer on specified\nterms, and in many labor cases ratification of a CBA is necessary to\nsatisfy this formation requirement. See App. 349\u2212351. But it is not the\nmere labeling of a dispute for contract law purposes that determines\nwhether an issue is arbitrable. The test for arbitrability remains\nwhether the parties consented to arbitrate the dispute in question.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand thus presupposes the CBA\u2019s existence, would seem\nplainly to cover a dispute that \u201carises under\u201d a specific\nsubstantive provision of the CBA, but does not so obvi\nously cover disputes about the CBA\u2019s own formation.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals relied upon the ratifica\ntion dispute\u2019s relationship to Granite Rock\u2019s claim that\nLocal breached the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause (a claim the\nCourt of Appeals viewed as clearly \u201carising under\u201d the\nCBA) to conclude that \u201cthe arbitration clause is certainly\n\u2018susceptible of an interpretation\u2019 that covers\u201d Local\u2019s for\nmation-date defense. 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.\n   The Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that this the\nory of the ratification dispute\u2019s arbitrability fails if the\nCBA was not formed at the time the unions engaged in the\nacts that gave rise to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims. The\nunions began their strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite\nRock filed its suit on July 9. If, as Local asserts, the CBA\ncontaining the parties\u2019 arbitration clause was not ratified,\nand thus not formed, until August 22, there was no CBA\nfor the July no-strike dispute to \u201carise under,\u201d and thus no\nvalid basis for the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Gran\nite Rock\u2019s July 9 claims arose under the CBA and were\nthus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local\u2019s formation\ndate defense to those claims.12 See ibid. For the foregoing\nreasons, resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute about whether\nthe CBA was ratified in July or August was central to\ndeciding Local\u2019s arbitration demand. Accordingly, the\nCourt of Appeals erred in holding that it was not neces\nsary for the District Court to determine the CBA\u2019s ratifica\ntion date in order to decide whether the parties agreed to\narbitrate Granite Rock\u2019s no-strike claim or the ratification\ndate dispute Local raised as a defense to that claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 This analysis pertains only to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, which\n\ndid not engage the 11th-hour retroactivity argument Local raised in its\nmerits brief in this Court, and that we address below.\n16              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Local seeks to address this flaw in the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision by arguing that in December 2004 the parties\nexecuted a document that rendered the CBA effective as of\nMay 1, 2004 (the date the prior CBA expired), and that\nthis effective-date language rendered the CBA\u2019s arbitra\ntion clause (but not its no-strike clause) applicable to the\nJuly strike period notwithstanding Local\u2019s view that the\nagreement was ratified in August (which ratification date\nLocal continues to argue controls the period during which\nthe no-strike clause applies). See Brief for Respondent\nLocal, pp. 26\u201327; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37\u221239. The Court of\nAppeals did not rule on the merits of this claim (i.e., it did\nnot decide whether the CBA\u2019s effective date language\nindeed renders some or all of the agreement\u2019s provisions\nretroactively applicable to May 2004), and we need not do\nso either. Even accepting Local\u2019s assertion that it raised\nthis retroactivity argument in the District Court, see Brief\nfor Respondent Local, p. 26,13 Local did not raise this\nargument in the Court of Appeals. Nor, more importantly,\ndid Local\u2019s brief in opposition to Granite Rock\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari raise the argument as an alternative ground on\nwhich this Court could or should affirm the Court of Ap\npeals\u2019 judgment finding the ratification-date dispute arbi\ntrable for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, the\nargument is properly \u201cdeemed waived.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2; Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 15\u221216).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 This claim is questionable because Local\u2019s February 2005 refer\n\nences to the agreement \u201cnow in effect\u201d are not obviously equivalent to\nthe express retroactivity argument Local asserts in its merits brief in\nthis Court. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 26\u221227.\n  14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s conclusion that we should nonetheless excuse\n\nLocal\u2019s waiver and consider the retroactivity argument, see post, at 5\u22126\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), is flawed. This\nCourt\u2019s Rule 15.2 reflects the fact that our adversarial system assigns\nboth sides responsibility for framing the issues in a case.

Section 20 of the CBA provides in relevant\npart that \u201c[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall\nbe resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\u201d\nwhich includes arbitration. App. 434 (emphasis added);\nsee also id., at 434\u2013437. The parties\u2019 ratification-date\ndispute cannot properly be characterized as falling within\nthe (relatively narrow, cf., e.g., Drake Bakeries Inc., 370\nU. S., at 256\u2013257) scope of this provision for at least two\nreasons. First, we do not think the question whether the\nCBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004\u2014a question that\nconcerns the CBA\u2019s very existence\u2014can fairly be said to\n\u201carise under\u201d the CBA. Second, even if the \u201carising under\u201d\nlanguage could in isolation be construed to cover this\ndispute, Section 20\u2019s remaining provisions all but foreclose\nsuch a reading by describing that section\u2019s arbitration\nrequirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are\naddressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of\nmandatory mediation. See App. 434\u2013437 (requiring arbi\ntration of disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA, but only after\nthe Union and Employer have exhausted mandatory\nmediation, and limiting any arbitration decision under\nthis provision to those \u201cwithin the scope and terms of\nthis agreement and . . . specifically limited to the matter\nsubmitted\u201d).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na party\u2019s noncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in\nthe first instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and\nother cases in a manner that the District Court and Court of Appeals\ndid not have an opportunity to consider, and that the parties\u2019 argu\nments before this Court may not fully address.\n18            GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion does not find\nsupport in the text of \u00a720. The Court of Appeals\u2019 only\neffort to grapple with that text misses the point because it\nfocuses on whether Granite Rock\u2019s claim to enforce the\nCBA\u2019s no-strike provisions could be characterized as \u201caris\ning under\u201d the agreement. See 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.\nEven assuming that claim can be characterized as \u201carising\nunder\u201d the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is\nwhether the formation-date defense that Local raised in\nresponse to Granite Rock\u2019s no-strike suit can be character\nized as \u201carising under\u201d the CBA. It cannot for the reasons\nwe have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring\narbitration of disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA is not\nfairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came\ninto existence. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to\naddress this question and holding instead that the arbitra\ntion clause is \u201csusceptible of an interpretation\u201d that covers\nLocal\u2019s formation-date defense to Granite Rock\u2019s suit\n\u201c[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing \u2018under\u2019 the alleged new\nCBA\u201d and \u201c[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very\nbroadly.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 1178.\n                              D\n   Local\u2019s remaining argument in support of the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment is similarly unavailing. Local reiter\nates the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Granite Rock\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitration when it sued to en\nforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provi\nsions. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 17\u201318. We do\nnot agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike\nso the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave\nrise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the\nratification (formation) date dispute we address above.\nSee 564 F. 3d, at 1178. It is of course true that when\nGranite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA\n(and all of its provisions) as enforceable. But Granite\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The mere fact that\nLocal raised the formation date dispute as a defense to\nGranite Rock\u2019s suit does not make that dispute attribut\nable to Granite Rock in the waiver or estoppel sense the\nCourt of Appeals suggested, see 546 F. 3d, at 1178, much\nless establish that Granite Rock agreed to arbitrate it by\nsuing to enforce the CBA as to other matters. Accordingly,\nwe hold that the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s formation\ndate was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to re\nsolve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that\nconclusion.\n                          III\n  We turn now to the claims available on remand. The\nparties agree that Granite Rock can bring a breach-of\ncontract claim under LMRA \u00a7301(a) against Local as a\nCBA signatory, and against IBT as Local\u2019s agent or alter\nego. See Brief for Respondent IBT 10\u201313; Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 12\u201313 and n. 11.15 The question is whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Although the parties concede the general availability of such a\n\nclaim against IBT, they dispute whether Granite Rock abandoned its\nagency or alter ego allegations in the course of this litigation. Compare\nBrief for Respondent IBT, p. 10 with Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\u201313,\nn. 11. Granite Rock concedes that it has abandoned its claim that IBT\nacted as Local\u2019s undisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification\nresponse to the July 2, 2004, CBA. See Plaintiff Granite Rock\u2019s Memo\nrandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant IBT\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss in No. 5:04\u2013cv\u201302767\u2013JW (ND Cal., Aug. 7, 2006),\nDoc. 178, pp. 6, 8 (hereinafter Points and Authorities). But Granite\nRock insists that it preserved its argument that Local served as IBT\u2019s\nagent or alter ego when Local denied ratification and engaged in\n20              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nGranite Rock may also bring a federal tort claim under\n\u00a7301(a) for IBT\u2019s alleged interference with the CBA.16\nBrief for Petitioner 32. The Court of Appeals joined virtu\nally all other Circuits in holding that it would not recog\nnize such a claim under \u00a7301(a).\n   Granite Rock asks us to reject this position as inconsis\ntent with federal labor law\u2019s goal of promoting industrial\npeace and economic stability through judicial enforcement\nof CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a\nfederal common law of labor contracts is necessary to\nfurther this goal. See id., at 31; see also, e.g., Textile\nWorkers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451 (1957).\nExplaining that IBT\u2019s conduct in this case undermines the\nvery core of the bargaining relationship federal labor laws\nexist to protect, Granite Rock argues that a federal\ncommon-law tort remedy for IBT\u2019s conduct is necessary\nbecause other potential avenues for deterring and redress\ning such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333; Reply Brief for Petitioner\n19\u201320. On the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock\nlists state-law tort claims, some of which this Court has\nheld \u00a7301(a) pre-empts, as well as administrative (unfair\nlabor practices) claims, which Granite Rock says the Na\ntional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot entertain\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunauthorized strike activity in July 2004. Nothing in the record before\nus unequivocally refutes this assertion. See App. 306, 311\u2013315, 318;\nPoints and Authorities 6, n. 3. Accordingly, nothing in this opinion\nforecloses the parties from litigating these claims on remand.\n   16 IBT argues that we should dismiss this question as improvidently\n\ngranted because Granite Rock abandoned its tortious interference claim\nwhen it declared its intention to seek only contractual (as opposed to\npunitive) damages on the claim. See Brief for Respondent IBT 16. We\nreject this argument, which confuses Granite Rock\u2019s decision to forgo\nthe pursuit of punitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon\nthe claim itself. The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no author\nity for the proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than eco\nnomic damages to state a claim on which relief could be granted.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst international unions that (like IBT) are not part of\nthe certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control.\nOn the insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists\nfederal common-law breach-of-contract claims, which\nGranite Rock says are difficult to prove against non-CBA\nsignatories like IBT because international unions struc\nture their relationships with local unions in a way that\nmakes agency or alter ego difficult to establish. Based on\nthese assessments, Granite Rock suggests that this case\npresents us with the choice of either recognizing the fed\neral common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanc\ntioning conduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes\nand our own precedents. See Brief for Petitioner 13\u201314.\n   We do not believe the choice is as stark as Granite Rock\nimplies. It is of course true that we have construed \u201cSec\ntion 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of\nfederal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining\nagreements.\u201d Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 361 U. S. 459,\n470 (1960) (citing Lincoln Mills, supra). But we have also\nemphasized that in developing this common law we \u201cdid\nnot envision any freewheeling inquiry into what the fed\neral courts might find to be the most desirable rule.\u201d\nHoward Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249,\n255 (1974). The balance federal statutes strike between\nemployer and union relations in the collective-bargaining\narena is carefully calibrated, see, e.g., NLRB v. Drivers,\n362 U. S. 274, 289\u2013290 (1960), and as the parties\u2019 briefs\nillustrate, creating a federal common-law tort cause of\naction would require a host of policy choices that could\neasily upset this balance, see Brief for Respondent IBT\n42\u201344; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22\u201325. It is thus no\nsurprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held\nthat federal courts\u2019 authority to \u201ccreate a federal common\nlaw of collective bargaining agreements under section 301\u201d\nshould be confined to \u201ca common law of contracts, not a\nsource of independent rights, let alone tort rights; for\n22              GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 301 is . . . a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce\ncontracts.\u201d Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6\nF. 3d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993). We see no reason for a\ndifferent result here because it would be premature to\nrecognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock re\nquests in this case even assuming that \u00a7301(a) authorizes\nus to do so.\n  In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the\nquestion before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the\nconduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but\nwhether we should augment the claims already available\nto Granite Rock by creating a new federal common-law\ncause of action under \u00a7301(a). That we decline to do so\ndoes not mean that we approve of IBT\u2019s alleged actions.\nGranite Rock describes a course of conduct that does\nindeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective\nbargaining process federal labor laws were designed to\nprotect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however,\na new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for\nthis conduct. Granite Rock\u2019s allegations have prompted\nfavorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also\nfrom the NLRB. In proceedings that predated those in\nwhich the District Court entered judgment for Granite\nRock on the CBA\u2019s formation date,17 the NLRB concluded\nthat a \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d was reached on July 2, and\nthat Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempt\ning to delay the CBA\u2019s ratification pending execution of a\nseparate agreement favorable to IBT. See In re Teamsters\nLocal 287, 347 N. L. R. B. 339, 340\u2013341, and n. 1 (2006)\n(applying the remedial order on the 2004 conduct to both\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Although the Board and federal jury reached different conclusions\n\nwith respect to the CBA\u2019s ratification date, the discrepancy has little\npractical significance because the Board\u2019s remedial order against Local\nand IBT gives \u201cretroactive effect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2,\n2004, as if ratified on that date.\u201d In re Teamsters Local 287, 347\nN.

Notably,\nGranite Rock (like IBT and the Court of Appeals) assumes\nthat federal common law provides the only possible basis\nfor the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue. See Brief for\nRespondent IBT 33\u201334; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But\nGranite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not\npresent us with occasion to address, whether state law\nmight provide a remedy. See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Raw\nson, 495 U. S. 362, 369\u2212371 (1990); Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U. S. 653, 656, 658 (1998). Nor did Granite\nRock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administra\ntive causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy\nIBT\u2019s conduct. For example, far from establishing that an\nagency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccess\nful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to\nprove than usual if, as the NLRB\u2019s decision observes, IBT\nand Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to\nGranite Rock\u2019s claims. See In re Teamsters Local 287,\nsupra, at 340, n. 6. Similarly, neither party has estab\nlished that the Board itself could not issue additional\nrelief against IBT. IBT\u2019s amici argue that the \u201coverlap\nbetween Granite Rock\u2019s \u00a7301 claim against the IBT and\nthe NLRB General Counsel\u2019s unfair labor practice com\nplaint against Local 287 brings into play the National\nLabor Relations Act rule that an international union\ncommits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated\nlocal unions to \u2018impose extraneous non-bargaining unit\n24            GRANITE ROCK CO. v.

S. C.\n\u00a7185(a). I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that the arbitration provision in the collective\nbargaining agreement (CBA) between Granite Rock and\nIBT Local 287 does not cover the parties\u2019 dispute over\nwhether Local 287 breached the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause.\nIn my judgment, the parties clearly agreed in the CBA to\nhave this dispute resolved by an arbitrator, not a court.\n   The legal principles that govern this case are simpler\nthan the Court\u2019s exposition suggests. Arbitration, all\nagree, \u201cis a matter of contract and a party cannot be re\nquired to submit to arbitration any dispute which [it] has\nnot agreed so to submit.\u201d Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf\nNav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960). Before ordering par\nties to arbitrate, a court must therefore confirm (1) that\nthe parties have an agreement to arbitrate and (2) that\nthe agreement covers their dispute. See ante, at 9.

The parties made the CBA retro\nactively \u201ceffect[ive] from May 1, 2004,\u201d the day after the\nexpiration of their prior collective-bargaining agreement.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. A\u2013190.

Id., at\nA\u2013176 to A\u2013179.\n   Granite Rock claims that Local 287 breached the CBA\u2019s\nno-strike clause by engaging in a work stoppage in July\n2004. Local 287 contests this claim. Specifically, it con\ntends that it had no duty to abide by the no-strike clause\nin July because it did not vote to ratify the CBA until\nAugust. As I see it, the parties\u2019 disagreement as to\nwhether the no-strike clause proscribed the July work\nstoppage is plainly a \u201cdisput[e] arising under\u201d the CBA\nand is therefore subject to arbitration as Local 287 de\nmands. Indeed, the parties\u2019 no-strike dispute is indistin\nguishable from myriad other disputes that an employer\nand union might have concerning the interpretation and\napplication of the substantive provisions of a collective\nbargaining agreement. These are precisely the sorts of\ncontroversies that labor arbitrators are called upon to\nresolve every day.\n   The majority seems to agree that the CBA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision generally encompasses disputes between Gran\nite Rock and Local 287 regarding the parties\u2019 compliance\nwith the terms of the CBA, including the no-strike clause.\nThe majority contends, however, that Local 287\u2019s \u201cforma\ntion-date defense\u201d raises a preliminary question of con\ntract formation that must be resolved by a court rather\nthan an arbitrator. Ante, at 15. The majority\u2019s reasoning\nappears to be the following: If Local 287 did not ratify the\nCBA until August, then there is \u201cno valid basis\u201d for apply\ning the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision to events that occurred\nin July. Ibid.\n   The majority\u2019s position is flatly inconsistent with the\nlanguage of the CBA. The parties expressly chose to make\nthe agreement effective from May 1, 2004. As a result,\n\u201cthe date on which [the] agreement was ratified\u201d does not,\nas the majority contends, determine whether the parties\u2019\ndispute about the permissibility of the July work stoppage\n4               GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nfalls within the scope of the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision.\nAnte, at 14. When it comes to answering the arbitrability\nquestion, it is entirely irrelevant whether Local 287 rati\nfied the CBA in August (as it contends) or in July (as\nGranite Rock contends). In either case, the parties\u2019 dis\npute\u2014which postdates May 1\u2014clearly \u201caris[es] under\u201d the\nCBA, which is all the arbitration provision requires to\nmake a dispute referable to an arbitrator. Cf. Litton\nFinancial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 201 (1991) (recognizing that \u201ca\ncollective-bargaining agreement might be drafted so as to\neliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and\nexecution of the new agreement\u201d).2\n   Given the CBA\u2019s express retroactivity, the majority errs\nin treating Local 287\u2019s ratification-date defense as a \u201cfor\nmation dispute\u201d subject to judicial resolution. Ante, at 13.\nThe defense simply goes to the merits of Granite Rock\u2019s\nclaim: Local 287 maintains that the no-strike clause\nshould not be construed to apply to the July work stoppage\nbecause it had not ratified the CBA at the time of that\naction. Cf. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\nU. S. 938, 942 (1995) (distinguishing a disagreement that\n\u201cmakes up the merits of the dispute\u201d from a disagreement\n\u201cabout the arbitrability of the dispute\u201d). Accordingly, the\ndefense is necessarily a matter for the arbitrator, not the\ncourt. See AT&T, 475 U. S., at 651 (\u201c[I]t is for the arbitra\ntor to determine the relative merits of the parties\u2019 sub\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Notably, at the time they executed the CBA in December 2004, the\n\nparties were well aware that they disagreed about the legitimacy of the\nJuly work stoppage. Yet they made the CBA retroactive to May and\ndeclined to carve out their no-strike dispute from the arbitration\nprovision, despite expressly excluding three other classes of disputes\nfrom arbitration.

S. 564, 568 (1960). \u201cWhen the\njudiciary undertakes to determine the merits of a griev\nance under the guise of interpreting the [arbitration provi\nsions] of collective bargaining agreements, it usurps a\nfunction . . . entrusted to the arbitration tribunal.\u201d Id., at\n569; see also AT&T, 475 U.

See ante, at 16. As a result of Local\n287\u2019s omission, the District Court and Court of Appeals\nproceeded under the understanding that this case pre\nsented a formation question. It was not until its merits\nbrief in this Court that Local 287 attempted to correct this\nmistaken premise by pointing to the parties\u2019 execution of\nthe December 2004 CBA with its May 2004 effective date.\nThis Court\u2019s rules \u201cadmonis[h] [counsel] that they have an\nobligation to the Court to point out in the brief in opposi\ntion [to certiorari], and not later, any perceived misstate\nment made in the petition [for certiorari]\u201d; nonjurisdic\ntional arguments not raised at that time \u201cmay be deemed\nwaived.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule 15.2. Although it is regretta\nble and inexcusable that Local 287 did not present its\n6             GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nargument earlier, I do not see it as one we can ignore. The\nquestion presented in this case presupposes that \u201cit is\ndisputed whether any binding contract exists.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner i. Because it is instead undisputed that the\nparties executed a binding contract in December 2004 that\nwas effective as of May 2004, we can scarcely pretend that\nthe parties have a formation dispute. Consideration of\nthis fact is \u201ca \u2018predicate to an intelligent resolution\u2019 of the\nquestion presented, and therefore \u2018fairly included\ntherein.\u2019 \u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (quot\ning Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258, n. 5 (1980); this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 14.1(a)). Indeed, by declining to consider the\nplain terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, the majority offers\nlittle more than \u201can opinion advising what the law would\nbe upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co.\nv. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 241 (1937). In view of the\nCBA\u2019s effective date, I would hold that the parties agreed\nto arbitrate the no-strike dispute, including Local 287\u2019s\nratification-date defense, and I would affirm the judgment\nbelow on this alternative ground. Cf. Dandridge v. Wil\nliams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970) (\u201cThe prevailing\nparty may, of course, assert in a reviewing court any\nground in support of [the] judgment, whether or not that\nground was relied upon or even considered by the trial\ncourt\u201d).\n</pre>",
