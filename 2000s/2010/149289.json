NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK\n\n                    LTD. ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08\u20131191. Argued March 29, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nIn 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank\n  whose \u201cordinary shares\u201d are not traded on any exchange in this coun\n  try, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquar\n  tered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages\u2014\n  seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc. In 2001, National\n  had to write down the value of HomeSide\u2019s assets, causing National\u2019s\n  share prices to fall. Petitioners, Australians who purchased Na\n  tional\u2019s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents\u2014National,\n  HomeSide, and officers of both companies\u2014in Federal District Court\n  for violation of \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act\n  of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b\u20135. They claimed that HomeSide and its\n  officers had manipulated financial models to make the company\u2019s\n  mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really\n  were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of\n  this deception. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject\n  matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n  and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District\n  Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the\n  domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that con\n  cluded abroad. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit erred in considering \u00a710(b)\u2019s extraterritorial\n reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing\n dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). What conduct \u00a710(b) reaches is a mer\n its question, while subject-matter jurisdiction \u201crefers to a tribunal\u2019s\n power to hear a case.\u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Loco\n motive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central\n2         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n    District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U. S. C. \u00a778aa to adjudicate\n    the \u00a710(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of\n    that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule\n    12(b)(6). Pp. 4\u20135.\n       2. Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plain\n    tiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in con\n    nection with securities traded on foreign exchanges. Pp. 5\u201324.\n          (a) It is a \u201clongstanding principle of American law \u2018that legisla\n    tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply\n    only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u2019 \u201d EEOC\n    v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco). When a\n    statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it\n    has none. Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange\n    Act\u2019s silence about \u00a710(b)\u2019s extraterritorial application permitted the\n    court to \u201cdiscern\u201d whether Congress would have wanted the statute\n    to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and\n    has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent\n    that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.\n    The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against ex\n    traterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court\n    applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background\n    against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects. Pp. 5\u2013\n    12.\n          (b) Because Rule 10b\u20135 was promulgated under \u00a710(b), it \u201cdoes\n    not extend beyond conduct encompassed by \u00a710(b)\u2019s prohibition.\u201d\n    United States v. O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651. Thus, if \u00a710(b) is not\n    extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b\u20135. On its face, \u00a710(b) contains\n    nothing to suggest that it applies abroad. Contrary to the argument\n    of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign\n    commerce in the definition of \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d see 15 U. S. C.\n    \u00a778c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity, Aramco, supra, at 251. Nor does a fleeting reference, in \u00a778b(2)\u2019s\n    description of the Exchange Act\u2019s purposes, to the dissemination and\n    quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities. Nor does\n    Exchange Act \u00a730(b), which says that the Act does not apply \u201cto any\n    person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the ju\n    risdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he does so in violation of regu\n    lations promulgated by the SEC \u201cto prevent . . . evasion of [the Act].\u201d\n    This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has ex\n    traterritorial application; the Commission\u2019s enabling regulations pre\n    venting \u201cevasion\u201d seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal\n    a domestic violation. The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  General also fails to account for \u00a730(a), which explicitly provides for a\n  specific extraterritorial application. That provision would be quite\n  superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to trans\n  actions on foreign exchanges\u2014and its limitation of that application to\n  securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. There being no\n  affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that \u00a710(b) applies extra\n  territorially, it does not. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (c) The domestic activity in this case\u2014Florida is where Home-\n  Side and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and\n  where some misleading public statements were made\u2014does not\n  mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act. It is a\n  rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all con\n  tact with United States territory. In Aramco, for example, where the\n  plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see\n  499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the \u201cfocus\u201d of congres\n  sional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither\n  that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employ\n  ment. Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act\u2019s focus is not\n  on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and\n  sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) applies only to\n  transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic\n  transactions in other securities. The primacy of the domestic ex\n  change is suggested by the Exchange Act\u2019s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881,\n  and by the fact that the Act\u2019s registration requirements apply only to\n  securities listed on national securities exchanges, \u00a778l(a). This focus\n  is also strongly confirmed by \u00a730(a) and (b). Moreover, the Court re\n  jects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this coun\n  try affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason\n  that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probabil\n  ity of incompatibility with other countries\u2019 laws is so obvious that if\n  Congress intended such foreign application \u201cit would have addressed\n  the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.\u201d 499 U. S.,\n  at 256. Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual\n  support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a viola\n  tion where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the\n  United States.

Its Ordinary Shares\u2014what in America would be\ncalled \u201ccommon stock\u201d\u2014are traded on the Australian\nStock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities\nexchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States.\nThere are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, how\u00ad\never, National\u2019s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs),\nwhich represent the right to receive a specified number of\nNational\u2019s Ordinary Shares. 547 F. 3d 167, 168, and n. 1\n(CA2 2008).\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which we\naccept as true. In February 1998, National bought re\u00ad\nspondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing\n2      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany headquartered in Florida. HomeSide\u2019s business\nwas to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the\nadministrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage\npayments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and\nFinancial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re\u00ad\nceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can\nprovide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal\u00ad\ngrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,\nM. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of\nthe rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the\nmortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is\ndue, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu\u00ad\nlated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by\nusing valuation models designed to take this likelihood\ninto account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the\nnumbers appeared in National\u2019s financial statements.\n   From 1998 until 2001, National\u2019s annual reports and\nother public documents touted the success of HomeSide\u2019s\nbusiness, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National\u2019s\nmanaging director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race\n(HomeSide\u2019s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris\n(HomeSide\u2019s chief executive officer) did the same in public\nstatements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that\nit was writing down the value of HomeSide\u2019s assets by\n$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another\n$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and\nADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,\nNational explained the September write-down as the\nresult of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing\ninterest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc\u00ad\nings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other\nmistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the\nloss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,\nHomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior\nexecutive who is also a respondent here had manipulated\nHomeSide\u2019s financial models to make the rates of early\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The complaint also alleges that National and\nCicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did\nnothing about it.\n  As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and\nBrian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased\nNational\u2019s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the\nwrite-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,\nand the three HomeSide executives in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York for\nalleged violations of \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778j(b)\nand 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135\n(2009), promulgated pursuant to \u00a710(b).2 They sought to\nrepresent a class of foreign purchasers of National\u2019s Ordi\u00ad\nnary Shares during a specified period up to the September\nwrite-down. 547 F. 3d, at 169.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Robert Morrison, an American investor in National\u2019s ADRs, also\n\nbrought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court\nbecause he failed to allege damages. In re National Australia Bank\nSecurities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *9\n(SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547\nF. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.\nInexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the\nCourt of Appeals and here.\n  2 The relevant text of \u00a710(b) and SEC Rule 10b\u20135 are set forth later in\n\nthis opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:\n\u201cEvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\nunder any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation\nthereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the\nsame extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such\ncontrolled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good\nfaith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut\u00ad\ning the violation or cause of action.\u201d\nLiability under \u00a720(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act; \u00a710(b) is the only basis petitioners\nasserted.\n4      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nand for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion on the former ground,\nfinding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country\nwere, \u201cat most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall\nsecurities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.\u201d In re\nNational Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.\n6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on\nsimilar grounds. The acts performed in the United States\ndid not \u201ccompris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.\u201d 547\nF. 3d, at 175\u2013176. We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009).\n                              II\n   Before addressing the question presented, we must\ncorrect a threshold error in the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis.\nIt considered the extraterritorial reach of \u00a710(b) to raise a\nquestion of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it af\u00ad\nfirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).\nSee 547 F. 3d, at 177. In this regard it was following\nCircuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405\nF. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405\nF. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in\ntaking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi\nties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti\nnental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,\n592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).\n   But to ask what conduct \u00a710(b) reaches is to ask what\nconduct \u00a710(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.\nSubject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, \u201crefers to a tribu\u00ad\nnal\u2019s \u2018 \u201cpower to hear a case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v.\nLocomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Ad\njustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.

S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate\nfrom the question whether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction\nunder 15 U. S. C. \u00a778aa3 to adjudicate the question\nwhether \u00a710(b) applies to National\u2019s conduct.\n  In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,\npetitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.\nSince nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on\nthe mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule\n12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we\nhave done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,\n381\u2013384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 allegations state a claim.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   It is a \u201clongstanding principle of American law \u2018that\nlegislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears,\nis meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe United States.\u2019 \u201d EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,\n499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros.,\nInc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle\nrepresents a canon of construction, or a presumption about\na statute\u2019s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress\u2019s\npower to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284\nU. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that\nCongress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Section 78aa provides:\n\u201cThe district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive\njurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula\u00ad\ntions thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought\nto enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the\nrules and regulations thereunder.\u201d\n6      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.\n197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, \u201cunless there is the affirma\u00ad\ntive intention of the Congress clearly expressed\u201d to give a\nstatute extraterritorial effect, \u201cwe must presume it is\nprimarily concerned with domestic conditions.\u201d Aramco,\nsupra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ncanon or presumption applies regardless of whether there\nis a risk of conflict between the American statute and a\nforeign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509\nU. S. 155, 173\u2013174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear\nindication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.\n   Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often\nrecited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,\nbecause the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito\u00ad\nrial application of \u00a710(b), it was left to the court to \u201cdis\u00ad\ncern\u201d whether Congress would have wanted the statute to\napply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex\u00ad\ntraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many\ndecades by various courts of appeals in determining the\napplication of the Exchange Act, and \u00a710(b) in particular,\nto fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects\nabroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin\u00ad\ning what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu\u00ad\nlation and unpredictable in application.\n   As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis\u00ad\ntrict of New York had consistently concluded that, by\nreason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n\u00a710(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly\u00ad\ning the violation occurred abroad. See Schoenbaum v.\nFirstbrook, 268 F. Supp. 385, 392 (1967) (citing Ferraoli v.\nCantor, CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. \u00b691615 (SDNY 1965) and\nKook v. Crang, 182 F. Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)).\nSchoenbaum involved the sale in Canada of the treasury\nshares of a Canadian corporation whose publicly traded\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed\non both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto\nStock Exchange. Invoking the presumption against extra\u00ad\nterritoriality, the court held that \u00a710(b) was inapplicable\n(though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).\n268 F. Supp., at 391\u2013392, 393\u2013394. The decision in\nSchoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit\nopinion which held that \u201cneither the usual presumption\nagainst extraterritorial application of legislation nor the\nspecific language of [\u00a7]30(b) show Congressional intent to\npreclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions\nregarding stocks traded in the United States which are\neffected outside the United States . . . .\u201d Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply \u00a710(b) that, although the\ntransactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they\naffected the value of the common shares publicly traded in\nthe United States. See id., at 208\u2013209. Application of\n\u00a710(b), the Second Circuit found, was \u201cnecessary to protect\nAmerican investors,\u201d id., at 206.\n  The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data\nProcessing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),\nwhich involved an American company that had been\nfraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,\nunlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had\noccurred in the United States but the corporation whose\nsecurities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any\ndomestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality apples only to matters over\nwhich the United States would not have prescriptive\njurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive\njurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun\u00ad\ntry, the language of the Act could be read to cover that\nconduct, and the court concluded that \u201cif Congress had\nthought about the point,\u201d it would have wanted \u00a710(b) to\napply. Id., at 1334\u20131337.\n  With Schoenbaum and Leasco on the books, the Second\n8      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito\u00ad\nriality from the jurisprudence of \u00a710(b) and replaced it\nwith the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and\nhence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the\nstatute to a given situation. As long as there was pre\u00ad\nscriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex\u00ad\nplained, whether to apply \u00a710(b) even to \u201cpredominantly\nforeign\u201d transactions became a matter of whether a court\nthought Congress \u201cwished the precious resources of United\nStates courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted\nto them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun\u00ad\ntries.\u201d Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985\n(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017\u2013\n1018 (CA2 1975).\n   The Second Circuit had thus established that applica\u00ad\ntion of \u00a710(b) could be premised upon either some effect on\nAmerican securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or\nsignificant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later\nformalized these two applications into (1) an \u201ceffects test,\u201d\n\u201cwhether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in\nthe United States or upon United States citizens,\u201d and (2)\na \u201cconduct test,\u201d \u201cwhether the wrongful conduct occurred\nin the United States.\u201d SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192\u2013\n193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit\u2019s \u00a710(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to\nwhat Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second\nCircuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the\nground that \u201can admixture or combination of the two often\ngives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United\nStates involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by\nan American court.\u201d Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54\nF. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for\u00ad\nward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.\nAs early as Bersch, it confessed that \u201cif we were asked to\npoint to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative\nhistory, that compelled these conclusions, we would be\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunable to respond,\u201d 519 F. 2d, at 993.\n   As they developed, these tests were not easy to adminis\u00ad\nter. The conduct test was held to apply differently de\u00ad\npending on whether the harmed investors were Americans\nor foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of\nlosses to American investors abroad, it was enough that\nacts \u201cof material importance\u201d performed in the United\nStates \u201csignificantly contributed\u201d to that result; whereas\nthose acts must have \u201cdirectly caused\u201d the result when\nlosses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519\nF. 2d, at 993. And \u201cmerely preparatory activities in the\nUnited States\u201d did not suffice \u201cto trigger application of the\nsecurities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.\u201d\nId., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between\nmere preparation and using the United States as a \u201cbase\u201d\nfor fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,\nat 1017\u20131018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was\nsometimes insufficient without \u201c \u2018some additional factor\ntipping the scales\u2019 \u201d in favor of the application of American\nlaw. Interbrew v. Edperbrascan Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 425,\n432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting Europe & Overseas Commodity\nTraders, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118,\n129 (CA2 1998)). District courts have noted the difficulty\nof applying such vague formulations. See, e.g., In re\nAlstom SA, 406 F. Supp. 2d 346, 366\u2013385 (SDNY 2005).\nThere is no more damning indictment of the \u201cconduct\u201d and\n\u201ceffects\u201d tests than the Second Circuit\u2019s own declaration\nthat \u201cthe presence or absence of any single factor which\nwas considered significant in other cases . . . is not neces\u00ad\nsarily dispositive in future cases.\u201d IIT v. Cornfeld, 619\nF. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit\u2019s approach,\nthough not its precise application. Like the Second Cir\u00ad\ncuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater\u00ad\nritorial application of \u00a710(b) as essentially resolving mat\u00ad\nters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116\n10      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F. 2d, at 421\u2013422;\nGrunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F. 2d 421, 424\u2013425 (CA9\n1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F. 3d 659, 667\n(CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental meth\u00ad\nodology of balancing interests and arriving at what\nseemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of\nvaguely related variations on the \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d\ntests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:\n\u201cAlthough the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are\nsome transnational situations to which the antifraud\nprovisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement\nappears to end at that point.\u201d4 Id., at 665. See also id., at\n665\u2013667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits\nand adopting yet another variation).\n  At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of\ncases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.\nIn Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32\n(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed\nthat rather than courts\u2019 \u201cdivining what \u2018Congress would\nhave wished\u2019 if it had addressed the problem[, a] more\nnatural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\n\njudgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,\nlaunching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure\n(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice\nRehnquist\u2019s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU. S. 723, 737 (1975) that \u201c[w]hen we deal with private actions under\nRule 10b\u20135, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little\nmore than a legislative acorn.\u201d Post, at 3. The concurrence seemingly\nbelieves that the Courts of Appeals have carefully trimmed and\nsculpted this \u201cjudicial oak\u201d into a cohesive canopy, under the watchful\neye of Judge Henry Friendly, the \u201cmaster arborist,\u201d ibid. See post, at\n2\u20133. Even if one thinks that the \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d tests are\nnumbered among Judge Friendly\u2019s many fine contributions to the law,\nhis successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture\nthe same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically\ndistinct tree. It is telling that the concurrence never attempts its own\nsynthesis of the various balancing tests the Circuits have adopted.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See also Robinson v. TCI/US\nWest Communications Inc., 117 F. 3d 900, 906\u2013907 (CA5\n1997) (expressing agreement with Zoelsch\u2019s criticism of\nthe emphasis on policy considerations in some of the\ncases).\n  Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and\ninconsistent application of \u00a710(b) to transnational cases.\nSee, e.g., Choi & Silberman, Transnational Litigation and\nGlobal Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis.

Probs. 241, 244\u2013248\n(1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the\nCourts of Appeals\u2019 approach, namely that Congress did not\nconsider the extraterritorial application of \u00a710(b) (thereby\nleaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine\nwhat Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The\nInternational Reach of Rule 10b\u20135: The Myth of Congres\u00ad\nsional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat\u2019l L. 677 (1990) (ar\u00ad\nguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the\nExchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more\nfundamentally, have noted that using congressional si\u00ad\nlence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the\ntraditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial\napplication. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):\nA Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to\nthe Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provi\u00ad\nsions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law & Pol\u2019y\n12       MORRISON v.

The results of judi\u00ad\ncial-speculation-made-law\u2014divining what Congress would\nhave wanted if it had thought of the situation before the\ncourt\u2014demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in\neach case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserv\u00ad\ning a stable background against which Congress can legis\u00ad\nlate with predictable effects.5\n                            B\n  Rule 10b\u20135, the regulation under which petitioners have\nbrought suit,6 was promulgated under \u00a710(b), and \u201cdoes\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in\n\nthe judicial lawmaking, because \u201c[t]his entire area of law is replete with\njudge-made rules,\u201d post, at 3. It is doubtless true that, because the\nimplied private cause of action under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135 is a thing\nof our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to \u201cthe scope of [the] conduct\nprohibited by [Rule 10b\u20135 and] \u00a710(b), the text of the statute controls\nour decision.\u201d Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994).

O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651\n(1997). Therefore, if \u00a710(b) is not extraterritorial, neither\nis Rule 10b\u20135.\n   On its face, \u00a710(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies\nabroad:\n     \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi\u00ad\n     rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility\n     of any national securities exchange . . .

S. C. 78j(b).\nPetitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however,\nthat three things indicate that \u00a710(b) or the Exchange Act\nin general has at least some extraterritorial application.\n   First, they point to the definition of \u201cinterstate com\u00ad\nmerce,\u201d a term used in \u00a710(b), which includes \u201ctrade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between\nany foreign country and any State.\u201d             15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(17). But \u201cwe have repeatedly held that even stat\u00ad\nutes that contain broad language in their definitions of\n\u2018commerce\u2019 that expressly refer to \u2018foreign commerce\u2019 do\nnot apply abroad.\u201d Aramco, 499 U. S., at 251; see id., at\n251\u2013252 (discussing cases). The general reference to\nforeign commerce in the definition of \u201cinterstate com\u00ad\nmerce\u201d does not defeat the presumption against extraterri\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   The Second Circuit considered petitioners\u2019 appeal to raise only a\nclaim under Rule 10b\u20135(b), since it found their claims under subsec\u00ad\ntions (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F. 3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise.\n14         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoriality.7\n   Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that\nCongress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act,\nobserved that the \u201cprices established and offered in such\ntransactions are generally disseminated and quoted\nthroughout the United States and foreign countries.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778b(2). The antecedent of \u201csuch transactions,\u201d\nhowever, is found in the first sentence of the section,\nwhich declares that \u201ctransactions in securities as com\u00ad\nmonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the\u00ad\ncounter markets are affected with a national public inter\u00ad\nest.\u201d \u00a778b. Nothing suggests that this national public\ninterest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign\nexchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the\ndissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securi\u00ad\nties traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot\novercome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is \u00a730(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778dd(b), which does mention the Act\u2019s extraterritorial\napplication: \u201cThe provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of\nany rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission \u201cto prevent . . .\nevasion of [the Act].\u201d (The parties have pointed us to no\nregulation promulgated pursuant to \u00a730(b).)

S. C. \u00a778c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose\nexecutives approve the publication in the United States of misleading\ninformation affecting the price of the issuer\u2019s securities traded on the\nNew York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumen\u00ad\ntality of \u201ccommunication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In the first place, it would be odd\nfor Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of\nthe whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing\na condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the\nwhole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission\u2019s\nenabling regulations be limited to those preventing \u201ceva\u00ad\nsion\u201d of the Act, rather than all those preventing \u201cviola\u00ad\ntion\u201d? The provision seems to us directed at actions\nabroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might\ncause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to\nescape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General\u2019s\nproposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations\nof statutory language do not override the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253.\n   The Solicitor General also fails to account for \u00a730(a),\nwhich reads in relevant part as follows:\n       \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to\n    make use of the mails or of any means or instrumen\u00ad\n    tality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effect\u00ad\n    ing on an exchange not within or subject to the juris\u00ad\n    diction of the United States, any transaction in any\n    security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is or\u00ad\n    ganized under the laws of, or has its principal place of\n    business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdic\u00ad\n    tion of the United States, in contravention of such\n    rules and regulations as the Commission may pre\u00ad\n    scribe . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778dd(a).\nSubsection 30(a) contains what \u00a710(b) lacks: a clear\nstatement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision\nfor a specific extraterritorial application would be quite\nsuperfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied\nto transactions on foreign exchanges\u2014and its limitation of\n16       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat application to securities of domestic issuers would be\ninoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute\nprovides for some extraterritorial application, the pre\u00ad\nsumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,\n550 U. S. 437, 455\u2013456 (2007). No one claims that \u00a730(a)\napplies here.\n   The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar\u00ad\nrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies\nabroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see\npost, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to\nthink, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a\n\u201cclear statement rule,\u201d ibid., if by that is meant a re\u00ad\nquirement that a statute say \u201cthis law applies abroad.\u201d\nAssuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever\nsources of statutory meaning one consults to give \u201cthe\nmost faithful reading\u201d of the text, post, at 7, there is no\nclear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur\u00ad\nrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but\nmerely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica\u00ad\ntions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.\nAs the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to\nthe dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not\nsuffice.8\n   In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex\u00ad\nchange Act that \u00a710(b) applies extraterritorially, and we\ntherefore conclude that it does not.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic\u00ad\n\nitly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in\nAramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to\ngive a statute explicit extraterritorial effect\u2014and how to limit that\neffect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment\ndid.

This is less an answer to the\npresumption against extraterritorial application than it is\nan assertion\u2014a quite valid assertion\u2014that that presump\u00ad\ntion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its\napplication requires further analysis. For it is a rare case\nof prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all\ncontact with the territory of the United States. But the\npresumption against extraterritorial application would be\na craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel\nwhenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.\nThe concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti\u00ad\nnel, see post, at 7\u20138, but our cases are to the contrary. In\nAramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired\nin Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,\nat 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that\nterritorial event nor that relationship was the \u201cfocus\u201d of\ncongressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic\nemployment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285\u2013\n286.\n   Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that\nthe focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where\nthe deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of\nsecurities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not\npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct \u201cin\nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security regis\u00ad\ntered on a national securities exchange or any security not\nso registered.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b). See SEC v. Zandford,\n18        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n535 U. S. 813, 820 (2002). Those purchase-and-sale trans\u00ad\nactions are the objects of the statute\u2019s solicitude. It is\nthose transactions that the statute seeks to \u201cregulate,\u201d see\nSuperintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty\nCo., 404 U. S. 6, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective\nparties to those transactions that the statute seeks to\n\u201cprotec[t],\u201d id., at 10.     See also Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976). And it is in our\nview only transactions in securities listed on domestic\nexchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,\nto which \u00a710(b) applies.9\n   The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by\nthe very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as\nits object \u201c[t]o provide for the regulation of securities\nexchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign com\u00ad\nmerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and\nunfair practices on such exchanges . . . .\u201d 48 Stat. 881. We\nknow of no one who thought that the Act was intended to\n\u201cregulat[e]\u201d foreign securities exchanges\u2014or indeed who\neven believed that under established principles of interna\u00ad\ntional law Congress had the power to do so. The Act\u2019s\nregistration requirements apply only to securities listed on\nnational securities exchanges. 15 U. S. C. \u00a778l(a).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The concurrence seems to think this test has little to do with our\nconclusion in Part III, supra, that \u00a710(b) does not apply extraterritori\u00ad\nally. See post, at 11\u201312. That is not so. If \u00a710(b) did apply abroad, we\nwould not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it\nwould apply to all of them (barring some other limitation). Thus,\nalthough it is true, as we have said, that our threshold conclusion that\n\u00a710(b) has no extraterritorial effect does not resolve this case, it is a\nnecessary first step in the analysis.\n   The concurrence also makes the curious criticism that our evaluation\nof where a putative violation occurs is based on the text of \u00a710(b) rather\nthan the doctrine in the Courts of Appeals. Post, at 1\u20132. Although it\nconcedes that our test is textually plausible, post, at 1, it does not (and\ncannot) make the same claim for the Court-of-Appeals doctrine it\nendorses. That is enough to make our test the better one.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     19\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  With regard to securities not registered on domestic\nexchanges, the exclusive focus on domestic purchases and\nsales10 is strongly confirmed by \u00a730(a) and (b), discussed\nearlier. The former extends the normal scope of the Ex\u00ad\nchange Act\u2019s prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of\nrules prescribed by the Commission, a \u201ctransaction\u201d in a\nUnited States security \u201con an exchange not within or\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \u00a778dd(a).\nAnd the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to \u201cany\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nCommission \u201cto prevent evasion [of the Act].\u201d \u00a778dd(b).\nUnder both provisions it is the foreign location of the\ntransaction that establishes (or reflects the presumption\nof) the Act\u2019s inapplicability, absent regulations by the\nCommission.\n  The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in\nthe Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the\nsame Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of\nthe same comprehensive regulation of securities trading.\nSee Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank\nof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 170\u2013171 (1994). That\nlegislation makes it unlawful to sell a security, through a\nprospectus or otherwise, making use of \u201cany means or\ninstruments of transportation or communication in inter\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 That   is in our view the meaning which the presumption against\nextraterritorial application requires for the words \u201cpurchase or sale, of\n. . . any security not so registered\u201d in \u00a710(b)\u2019s phrase \u201cin connection with\nthe purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities\nexchange or any security not so registered\u201d (emphasis added). Even\nwithout the presumption against extraterritorial application, the only\nalternative to that reading makes nonsense of the phrase, causing it to\ncover all purchases and sales of registered securities, and all purchases\nand sales of nonregistered securities\u2014a thought which, if intended,\nwould surely have been expressed by the simpler phrase \u201call purchases\nand sales of securities.\u201d\n20     MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate commerce or of the mails,\u201d unless a registration\nstatement is in effect. 15 U. S. C. \u00a777e(a)(1). The Com\u00ad\nmission has interpreted that requirement \u201cnot to include\n. . . sales that occur outside the United States.\u201d 17 CFR\n\u00a7230.901 (2009).\n    Finally, we reject the notion that the Exchange Act\nreaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or\ntransactions abroad for the same reason that Aramco\nrejected overseas application of Title VII to all domesti\u00ad\ncally concluded employment contracts or all employment\ncontracts with American employers: The probability of\nincompatibility with the applicable laws of other countries\nis so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign appli\u00ad\ncation \u201cit would have addressed the subject of conflicts\nwith foreign laws and procedures.\u201d 499 U. S., at 256. Like\nthe United States, foreign countries regulate their domes\u00ad\ntic securities exchanges and securities transactions occur\u00ad\nring within their territorial jurisdiction. And the regula\u00ad\ntion of other countries often differs from ours as to what\nconstitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what\ndamages are recoverable, what discovery is available in\nlitigation, what individual actions may be joined in a\nsingle suit, what attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable, and many\nother matters. See, e.g., Brief for United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 16\u2013\n21.

The transactional test we have adopted\u2014whether\nthe purchase or sale is made in the United States, or\ninvolves a security listed on a domestic exchange\u2014meets\nthat requirement.\n                             B\n   The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which\npetitioners also endorse: \u201c[A] transnational securities\nfraud violates [\u00a7]10(b) when the fraud involves significant\nconduct in the United States that is material to the fraud\u2019s\nsuccess.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16; see\nBrief for Petitioners 26. Neither the Solicitor General nor\npetitioners provide any textual support for this test. The\nSolicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a\ntest would serve: achieving a high standard of business\nethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securi\u00ad\nties markets and thereby promoting investor confidence,\nand preventing the United States from becoming a \u201cBar\u00ad\nbary Coast\u201d for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign\nmarkets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\nBut it provides no textual support for the last of these\npurposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign\nsecurities industry and securities markets abroad. It is\nour function to give the statute the effect its language\nsuggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to\nadmirable purposes it might be used to achieve.\n   If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable\nconsequences of the \u201csignificant and material conduct\u201d\ntest, one should also be repulsed by its adverse conse\u00ad\nquences. While there is no reason to believe that the\nUnited States has become the Barbary Coast for those\nperpetrating frauds on foreign securities markets, some\nfear that it has become the Shangri-La of class-action\nlitigation for lawyers representing those allegedly cheated\n22      MORRISON v.

United States, 544 U. S. 349 (2005).11 In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Discussed in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22\u201323. The\n\nSolicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust\ncases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with conse\u00ad\nquences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply\nextraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon\nCorp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274\nU. S. 268 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66 (1917); United States\nv. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U. S. 87 (1913). These are no\nlonger of relevance to the point (if they ever were), since Continental\nOre overruled the holding of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,\n213 U. S. 347, 357 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extrater\u00ad\nritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics\nCorp. Int\u2019l, 493 U. S. 400, 407\u2013408 (1990).          Moreover, the pre-\nContinental Ore cases all involved conspiracies to restrain trade in the\nUnited States, see Sisal Sales, supra, at 274\u2013276; Thomsen, supra, at\n88; Pacific & Arctic, supra, at 105\u2013106. And although a final case cited\nby the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,\n287\u2013288 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterri\u00ad\ntorial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a\nviolation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at\nissue\u2014the Lanham Act\u2014to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v.\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 252 (1991) (quoting 15\nU. S. C. \u00a71127).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71343 (2009 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defen\u00ad\ndants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in\nMaryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and\ndeprive the Canadian Government of revenue. 544 U. S.,\nat 353, 371. Section 1343 prohibits \u201cany scheme or artifice\nto defraud,\u201d\u2014fraud simpliciter, without any requirement\nthat it be \u201cin connection with\u201d any particular transaction\nor event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners\u2019\n\u201coffense was complete the moment they executed the\nscheme inside the United States,\u201d and that it was \u201c[t]his\ndomestic element of petitioners\u2019 conduct [that] the Gov\u00ad\nernment is punishing.\u201d 544 U. S., at 371. Section 10(b),\nby contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only\nsuch acts \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any\nsecurity registered on a national securities exchange or\nany security not so registered.\u201d Not deception alone, but\ndeception with respect to certain purchases or sales is\nnecessary for a violation of the statute.\n   The Solicitor General points out that the \u201csignificant\nand material conduct\u201d test is in accord with prevailing\nnotions of international comity. If so, that proves that if\nthe United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursu\u00ad\nant to the \u201csignificant and material conduct\u201d test it would\nnot violate customary international law; but it in no way\ntends to prove that that is what Congress has done.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commis\u00ad\nsion has adopted an interpretation similar to the \u201csignifi\u00ad\ncant and material conduct\u201d test, and that we should defer\nto that. In the two adjudications the Solicitor General\ncites, however, the Commission did not purport to be\nproviding its own interpretation of the statute, but relied\non decisions of federal courts\u2014mainly Court of Appeals\ndecisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and\nLeasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed\nearlier.

I would adhere to the general approach\nthat has been the law in the Second Circuit, and most of\nthe rest of the country, for nearly four decades.\n                              I\n    Today the Court announces a new \u201ctransactional test,\u201d\nante, at 21, for defining the reach of \u00a710(b) of the Securi\u00ad\nties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778j(b), and SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b)\n(2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to\n\u201ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges\n. . . and domestic transactions in other securities,\u201d ante, at\n18. If one confines one\u2019s gaze to the statutory text, the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion is a plausible one. But the federal\ncourts have been construing \u00a710(b) in a different manner\nfor a long time, and the Court\u2019s textual analysis is not\nnearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the aban\u00ad\ndonment of their doctrine.\n    The text and history of \u00a710(b) are famously opaque on\nthe question of when, exactly, transnational securities\n2        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrauds fall within the statute\u2019s compass. As those types of\nfrauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th\ncentury, the federal courts were increasingly called upon\nto wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit, located in the Nation\u2019s financial cen\u00ad\nter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum\nv. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev\u2019d on rehearing on other\ngrounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,\nover an extended series of cases, to \u201cdiscern\u201d under what\ncircumstances \u201cCongress would have wished the precious\nresources of the United States courts and law enforcement\nagencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,\u201d\n547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the\nSecond Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects\ntest. This test asks \u201c(1) whether the wrongful conduct\noccurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong\u00ad\nful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or\nupon United States citizens.\u201d Id., at 171. Numerous cases\nflesh out the proper application of each prong.\n   The Second Circuit\u2019s test became the \u201cnorth star\u201d of\n\u00a710(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but\nnationally as well. With minor variations, other courts\nconverged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 15 (\u201cThe courts have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See, e.g., IIT, Int\u2019l Inv.

If this Court were to do likewise, as I\nwould have us do, the lower courts would of course cohere even more\ntightly around the Second Circuit\u2019s rule.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The Second Circuit\nrefined its test over several decades and dozens of cases,\nwith the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission\nand with the general assent of its sister Circuits. That\nhistory is a reason we should give additional weight to the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s \u201cjudge-made\u201d doctrine, not a reason to\ndenigrate it. \u201cThe longstanding acceptance by the courts,\ncoupled with Congress\u2019 failure to reject [its] reasonable\ninterpretation of the wording of \u00a710(b), . . . argues signifi\u00ad\ncantly in favor of acceptance of the [Second Circuit] rule\nby this Court.\u201d Blue Chip, 421 U.

See, e.g., Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 529\u2013\n530 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.,\ndissenting) (\u201cIt has been recognized that the 1934 Act, including the\nprotections of Rule 10b\u20135, applies when foreign defendants have\ndefrauded American investors, particularly when . . . they have profited\nby virtue of proscribed conduct within our boundaries.

It is the Court, however, that misap\u00ad\nplies the presumption, in two main respects.\n   First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption\nfrom a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a\nclear statement rule. We have been here before. In the\ncase on which the Court primarily relies, EEOC v. Ara\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991) (Aramco),\nChief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s majority opinion included a\nsentence that appeared to make the same move. See id.,\nat 258 (\u201cCongress\u2019 awareness of the need to make a clear\nstatement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon\u00ad\nstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex\u00ad\npressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a\nstatute\u201d). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob\u00ad\njected. See id., at 261 (\u201c[C]ontrary to what one would\nconclude from the majority\u2019s analysis, this canon is not a\n\u2018clear statement\u2019 rule, the application of which relieves a\ncourt of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the\nlegislative will\u201d).\n   Yet even Aramco\u2014surely the most extreme application\nof the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time\non the Court6\u2014contained numerous passages suggesting\nthat the presumption may be overcome without a clear\ndirective. See id., at 248\u2013255 (majority opinion) (repeat\u00ad\nedly identifying congressional \u201cintent\u201d as the touchstone of\nthe presumption). And our cases both before and after\nAramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to\ngive effect to \u201call available evidence about the meaning\u201d of\na provision when considering its extraterritorial applica\u00ad\ntion, lest we defy Congress\u2019 will.

Hence, while the Court\u2019s\ndictum that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of\nan extraterritorial application, it has none,\u201d ante, at 6,\nmakes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The\npresumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a\ntheory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in\u00ad\nternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It\ndoes not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the\nmost faithful reading possible.\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in\nsuggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial\u00ad\nity is fatal to the Second Circuit\u2019s test. For even if the\npresumption really were a clear statement (or \u201cclear indi\u00ad\ncation,\u201d ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal\nrelevance to this case.\n   It is true, of course, that \u201cthis Court ordinarily construes\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of\nSherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v.

Yet Micro\nsoft\u2019s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court\u2019s rigid\ntheory. \u201cAs a principle of general application,\u201d Microsoft innocuously\nobserved, \u201cwe have stated that courts should \u2018assume that legislators\ntake account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when\nthey write American laws.\u2019 \u201d 550 U.

Accordingly, the presumption against extraterrito\u00ad\nriality \u201cprovides a sound basis for concluding that Section\n10(b) does not apply when a securities fraud with no ef\u00ad\nfects in the United States is hatched and executed entirely\noutside this country.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 22. But that is just about all it provides a sound\nbasis for concluding. And the conclusion is not very illu\u00ad\nminating, because no party to the litigation disputes it.\nNo one contends that \u00a710(b) applies to wholly foreign\nfrauds.\n   Rather, the real question in this case is how much, and\nwhat kinds of, domestic contacts are sufficient to trigger\napplication of \u00a710(b).8 In developing its conduct-and\u00ad\neffects test, the Second Circuit endeavored to derive a\nsolution from the Exchange Act\u2019s text, structure, history,\nand purpose.

The text of the Exchange Act indicates that \u00a710(b)\nextends to at least some activities with an international\ncomponent, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9\nThe Second Circuit draws the line as follows: \u00a710(b) ex\u00ad\ntends to transnational frauds \u201conly when substantial acts\nin furtherance of the fraud were committed within the\nUnited States,\u201d SEC v.

Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that\nCongress contemplated some amount of transnational application.

I do\nnot take issue with the Court for beginning its inquiry\nwith the statutory text, rather than the doctrine in the\nCourts of Appeals. Cf. ante, at 18, n. 9. I take issue with\nthe Court for beginning and ending its inquiry with the\nstatutory text, when the text does not speak with geo\u00ad\ngraphic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of,\nand the persuasive account of congressional intent embod\u00ad\nied in, the Second Circuit\u2019s rule.\n   Repudiating the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in its en\u00ad\ntirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose\nprivate parties from bringing \u00a710(b) actions whenever the\nrelevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are\nnot listed on a domestic exchange.12 The real motor of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Given its focus on \u201cdomestic conditions,\u201d Foley Bros., Inc. v.

As they generally should.\nUnder these circumstances, the odds of the fraud having a substantial\nconnection to the United States are low. In recognition of the Exchange\nAct\u2019s focus on American investors and the novelty of foreign-cubed\nlawsuits, and in the interest of promoting clarity, it might have been\nappropriate to incorporate one bright line into the Second Circuit\u2019s test,\nby categorically excluding such lawsuits from \u00a710(b)\u2019s ambit.\n  12 The Court\u2019s opinion does not, however, foreclose the Commission\n\nfrom bringing enforcement actions in additional circumstances, as no\nissue concerning the Commission\u2019s authority is presented by this case.\nThe Commission\u2019s enforcement proceedings not only differ from private\n\u00a710(b) actions in numerous potentially relevant respects, see Brief for\n12       MORRISON v.

Argued March 29, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nIn 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank\n  whose \u201cordinary shares\u201d are not traded on any exchange in this coun\n  try, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquar\n  tered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages\u2014\n  seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc. In 2001, National\n  had to write down the value of HomeSide\u2019s assets, causing National\u2019s\n  share prices to fall. Petitioners, Australians who purchased Na\n  tional\u2019s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents\u2014National,\n  HomeSide, and officers of both companies\u2014in Federal District Court\n  for violation of \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act\n  of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b\u20135. They claimed that HomeSide and its\n  officers had manipulated financial models to make the company\u2019s\n  mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really\n  were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of\n  this deception. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject\n  matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n  and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District\n  Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the\n  domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that con\n  cluded abroad. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit erred in considering \u00a710(b)\u2019s extraterritorial\n reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing\n dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). What conduct \u00a710(b) reaches is a mer\n its question, while subject-matter jurisdiction \u201crefers to a tribunal\u2019s\n power to hear a case.\u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v.

S. C. \u00a778aa to adjudicate\n    the \u00a710(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of\n    that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule\n    12(b)(6). Pp. 4\u20135.\n       2. Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plain\n    tiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in con\n    nection with securities traded on foreign exchanges. Pp. 5\u201324.\n          (a) It is a \u201clongstanding principle of American law \u2018that legisla\n    tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply\n    only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u2019 \u201d EEOC\n    v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco). When a\n    statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it\n    has none. Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange\n    Act\u2019s silence about \u00a710(b)\u2019s extraterritorial application permitted the\n    court to \u201cdiscern\u201d whether Congress would have wanted the statute\n    to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and\n    has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent\n    that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.\n    The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against ex\n    traterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court\n    applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background\n    against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects. Pp. 5\u2013\n    12.\n          (b) Because Rule 10b\u20135 was promulgated under \u00a710(b), it \u201cdoes\n    not extend beyond conduct encompassed by \u00a710(b)\u2019s prohibition.\u201d\n    United States v. O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651. Thus, if \u00a710(b) is not\n    extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b\u20135. On its face, \u00a710(b) contains\n    nothing to suggest that it applies abroad. Contrary to the argument\n    of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign\n    commerce in the definition of \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d see 15 U. S. C.\n    \u00a778c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity, Aramco, supra, at 251. Nor does a fleeting reference, in \u00a778b(2)\u2019s\n    description of the Exchange Act\u2019s purposes, to the dissemination and\n    quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities. Nor does\n    Exchange Act \u00a730(b), which says that the Act does not apply \u201cto any\n    person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the ju\n    risdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he does so in violation of regu\n    lations promulgated by the SEC \u201cto prevent . . . evasion of [the Act].\u201d\n    This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has ex\n    traterritorial application; the Commission\u2019s enabling regulations pre\n    venting \u201cevasion\u201d seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal\n    a domestic violation.

That provision would be quite\n  superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to trans\n  actions on foreign exchanges\u2014and its limitation of that application to\n  securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. There being no\n  affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that \u00a710(b) applies extra\n  territorially, it does not. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (c) The domestic activity in this case\u2014Florida is where Home-\n  Side and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and\n  where some misleading public statements were made\u2014does not\n  mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act. It is a\n  rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all con\n  tact with United States territory. In Aramco, for example, where the\n  plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see\n  499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the \u201cfocus\u201d of congres\n  sional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither\n  that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employ\n  ment. Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act\u2019s focus is not\n  on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and\n  sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) applies only to\n  transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic\n  transactions in other securities. The primacy of the domestic ex\n  change is suggested by the Exchange Act\u2019s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881,\n  and by the fact that the Act\u2019s registration requirements apply only to\n  securities listed on national securities exchanges, \u00a778l(a). This focus\n  is also strongly confirmed by \u00a730(a) and (b). Moreover, the Court re\n  jects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this coun\n  try affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason\n  that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probabil\n  ity of incompatibility with other countries\u2019 laws is so obvious that if\n  Congress intended such foreign application \u201cit would have addressed\n  the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.\u201d 499 U. S.,\n  at 256. Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual\n  support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a viola\n  tion where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the\n  United States.

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany headquartered in Florida. HomeSide\u2019s business\nwas to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the\nadministrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage\npayments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and\nFinancial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re\u00ad\nceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can\nprovide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal\u00ad\ngrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,\nM. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of\nthe rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the\nmortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is\ndue, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu\u00ad\nlated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by\nusing valuation models designed to take this likelihood\ninto account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the\nnumbers appeared in National\u2019s financial statements.\n   From 1998 until 2001, National\u2019s annual reports and\nother public documents touted the success of HomeSide\u2019s\nbusiness, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National\u2019s\nmanaging director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race\n(HomeSide\u2019s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris\n(HomeSide\u2019s chief executive officer) did the same in public\nstatements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that\nit was writing down the value of HomeSide\u2019s assets by\n$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another\n$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and\nADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,\nNational explained the September write-down as the\nresult of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing\ninterest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc\u00ad\nings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other\nmistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the\nloss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,\nHomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior\nexecutive who is also a respondent here had manipulated\nHomeSide\u2019s financial models to make the rates of early\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The complaint also alleges that National and\nCicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did\nnothing about it.\n  As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and\nBrian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased\nNational\u2019s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the\nwrite-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,\nand the three HomeSide executives in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York for\nalleged violations of \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U.

Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547\nF. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.\nInexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the\nCourt of Appeals and here.\n  2 The relevant text of \u00a710(b) and SEC Rule 10b\u20135 are set forth later in\n\nthis opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:\n\u201cEvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\nunder any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation\nthereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the\nsame extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such\ncontrolled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good\nfaith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut\u00ad\ning the violation or cause of action.\u201d\nLiability under \u00a720(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act; \u00a710(b) is the only basis petitioners\nasserted.\n4      MORRISON v.

The\nDistrict Court granted the motion on the former ground,\nfinding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country\nwere, \u201cat most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall\nsecurities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.\u201d In re\nNational Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.\n6537 (BSJ), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3844465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on\nsimilar grounds.

In this regard it was following\nCircuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405\nF. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405\nF. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in\ntaking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi\nties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti\nnental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,\n592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).\n   But to ask what conduct \u00a710(b) reaches is to ask what\nconduct \u00a710(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.\nSubject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, \u201crefers to a tribu\u00ad\nnal\u2019s \u2018 \u201cpower to hear a case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v.\nLocomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Ad\njustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n514 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate\nfrom the question whether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction\nunder 15 U. S. C. \u00a778aa3 to adjudicate the question\nwhether \u00a710(b) applies to National\u2019s conduct.\n  In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,\npetitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.\nSince nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on\nthe mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule\n12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we\nhave done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,\n381\u2013384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 allegations state a claim.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   It is a \u201clongstanding principle of American law \u2018that\nlegislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears,\nis meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe United States.\u2019 \u201d EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,\n499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros.,\nInc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle\nrepresents a canon of construction, or a presumption about\na statute\u2019s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress\u2019s\npower to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284\nU. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that\nCongress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Section 78aa provides:\n\u201cThe district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive\njurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula\u00ad\ntions thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought\nto enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the\nrules and regulations thereunder.\u201d\n6      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.\n197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, \u201cunless there is the affirma\u00ad\ntive intention of the Congress clearly expressed\u201d to give a\nstatute extraterritorial effect, \u201cwe must presume it is\nprimarily concerned with domestic conditions.\u201d Aramco,\nsupra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ncanon or presumption applies regardless of whether there\nis a risk of conflict between the American statute and a\nforeign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509\nU. S. 155, 173\u2013174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear\nindication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.\n   Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often\nrecited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,\nbecause the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito\u00ad\nrial application of \u00a710(b), it was left to the court to \u201cdis\u00ad\ncern\u201d whether Congress would have wanted the statute to\napply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex\u00ad\ntraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many\ndecades by various courts of appeals in determining the\napplication of the Exchange Act, and \u00a710(b) in particular,\nto fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects\nabroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin\u00ad\ning what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu\u00ad\nlation and unpredictable in application.\n   As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis\u00ad\ntrict of New York had consistently concluded that, by\nreason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n\u00a710(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly\u00ad\ning the violation occurred abroad.

Invoking the presumption against extra\u00ad\nterritoriality, the court held that \u00a710(b) was inapplicable\n(though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).\n268 F. Supp., at 391\u2013392, 393\u2013394. The decision in\nSchoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit\nopinion which held that \u201cneither the usual presumption\nagainst extraterritorial application of legislation nor the\nspecific language of [\u00a7]30(b) show Congressional intent to\npreclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions\nregarding stocks traded in the United States which are\neffected outside the United States . . . .\u201d Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply \u00a710(b) that, although the\ntransactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they\naffected the value of the common shares publicly traded in\nthe United States. See id., at 208\u2013209. Application of\n\u00a710(b), the Second Circuit found, was \u201cnecessary to protect\nAmerican investors,\u201d id., at 206.\n  The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data\nProcessing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),\nwhich involved an American company that had been\nfraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,\nunlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had\noccurred in the United States but the corporation whose\nsecurities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any\ndomestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality apples only to matters over\nwhich the United States would not have prescriptive\njurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive\njurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun\u00ad\ntry, the language of the Act could be read to cover that\nconduct, and the court concluded that \u201cif Congress had\nthought about the point,\u201d it would have wanted \u00a710(b) to\napply. Id., at 1334\u20131337.\n  With Schoenbaum and Leasco on the books, the Second\n8      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito\u00ad\nriality from the jurisprudence of \u00a710(b) and replaced it\nwith the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and\nhence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the\nstatute to a given situation. As long as there was pre\u00ad\nscriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex\u00ad\nplained, whether to apply \u00a710(b) even to \u201cpredominantly\nforeign\u201d transactions became a matter of whether a court\nthought Congress \u201cwished the precious resources of United\nStates courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted\nto them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun\u00ad\ntries.\u201d Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985\n(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017\u2013\n1018 (CA2 1975).\n   The Second Circuit had thus established that applica\u00ad\ntion of \u00a710(b) could be premised upon either some effect on\nAmerican securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or\nsignificant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later\nformalized these two applications into (1) an \u201ceffects test,\u201d\n\u201cwhether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in\nthe United States or upon United States citizens,\u201d and (2)\na \u201cconduct test,\u201d \u201cwhether the wrongful conduct occurred\nin the United States.\u201d SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192\u2013\n193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit\u2019s \u00a710(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to\nwhat Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second\nCircuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the\nground that \u201can admixture or combination of the two often\ngives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United\nStates involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by\nan American court.\u201d Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54\nF. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for\u00ad\nward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.\nAs early as Bersch, it confessed that \u201cif we were asked to\npoint to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative\nhistory, that compelled these conclusions, we would be\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The conduct test was held to apply differently de\u00ad\npending on whether the harmed investors were Americans\nor foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of\nlosses to American investors abroad, it was enough that\nacts \u201cof material importance\u201d performed in the United\nStates \u201csignificantly contributed\u201d to that result; whereas\nthose acts must have \u201cdirectly caused\u201d the result when\nlosses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519\nF. 2d, at 993. And \u201cmerely preparatory activities in the\nUnited States\u201d did not suffice \u201cto trigger application of the\nsecurities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.\u201d\nId., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between\nmere preparation and using the United States as a \u201cbase\u201d\nfor fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,\nat 1017\u20131018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was\nsometimes insufficient without \u201c \u2018some additional factor\ntipping the scales\u2019 \u201d in favor of the application of American\nlaw.

Cornfeld, 619\nF. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit\u2019s approach,\nthough not its precise application. Like the Second Cir\u00ad\ncuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater\u00ad\nritorial application of \u00a710(b) as essentially resolving mat\u00ad\nters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116\n10      MORRISON v.

While applying the same fundamental meth\u00ad\nodology of balancing interests and arriving at what\nseemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of\nvaguely related variations on the \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d\ntests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:\n\u201cAlthough the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are\nsome transnational situations to which the antifraud\nprovisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement\nappears to end at that point.\u201d4 Id., at 665. See also id., at\n665\u2013667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits\nand adopting yet another variation).\n  At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of\ncases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.\nIn Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32\n(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed\nthat rather than courts\u2019 \u201cdivining what \u2018Congress would\nhave wished\u2019 if it had addressed the problem[, a] more\nnatural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\n\njudgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,\nlaunching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure\n(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice\nRehnquist\u2019s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU. S. 723, 737 (1975) that \u201c[w]hen we deal with private actions under\nRule 10b\u20135, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little\nmore than a legislative acorn.\u201d Post, at 3.

See post, at\n2\u20133. Even if one thinks that the \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d tests are\nnumbered among Judge Friendly\u2019s many fine contributions to the law,\nhis successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture\nthe same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically\ndistinct tree.

Some have challenged the premise underlying the\nCourts of Appeals\u2019 approach, namely that Congress did not\nconsider the extraterritorial application of \u00a710(b) (thereby\nleaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine\nwhat Congress would have wanted).

Transnat\u2019l L. 677 (1990) (ar\u00ad\nguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the\nExchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more\nfundamentally, have noted that using congressional si\u00ad\nlence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the\ntraditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial\napplication. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):\nA Proposal for A New U. S.

The results of judi\u00ad\ncial-speculation-made-law\u2014divining what Congress would\nhave wanted if it had thought of the situation before the\ncourt\u2014demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality.

It is doubtless true that, because the\nimplied private cause of action under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135 is a thing\nof our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to \u201cthe scope of [the] conduct\nprohibited by [Rule 10b\u20135 and] \u00a710(b), the text of the statute controls\nour decision.\u201d Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). It is only with respect to the\nadditional \u201celements of the 10b\u20135 private liability scheme\u201d that we\n\u201chave had \u2018to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the\nissue[s] had the 10b\u20135 action been included as an express provision in\nthe 1934 Act.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651\n(1997). Therefore, if \u00a710(b) is not extraterritorial, neither\nis Rule 10b\u20135.\n   On its face, \u00a710(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies\nabroad:\n     \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi\u00ad\n     rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility\n     of any national securities exchange . . .

S. C. 78j(b).\nPetitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however,\nthat three things indicate that \u00a710(b) or the Exchange Act\nin general has at least some extraterritorial application.\n   First, they point to the definition of \u201cinterstate com\u00ad\nmerce,\u201d a term used in \u00a710(b), which includes \u201ctrade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between\nany foreign country and any State.\u201d             15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(17). But \u201cwe have repeatedly held that even stat\u00ad\nutes that contain broad language in their definitions of\n\u2018commerce\u2019 that expressly refer to \u2018foreign commerce\u2019 do\nnot apply abroad.\u201d Aramco, 499 U. S., at 251; see id., at\n251\u2013252 (discussing cases). The general reference to\nforeign commerce in the definition of \u201cinterstate com\u00ad\nmerce\u201d does not defeat the presumption against extraterri\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   The Second Circuit considered petitioners\u2019 appeal to raise only a\nclaim under Rule 10b\u20135(b), since it found their claims under subsec\u00ad\ntions (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F. 3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise.\n14         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoriality.7\n   Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that\nCongress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act,\nobserved that the \u201cprices established and offered in such\ntransactions are generally disseminated and quoted\nthroughout the United States and foreign countries.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778b(2). The antecedent of \u201csuch transactions,\u201d\nhowever, is found in the first sentence of the section,\nwhich declares that \u201ctransactions in securities as com\u00ad\nmonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the\u00ad\ncounter markets are affected with a national public inter\u00ad\nest.\u201d \u00a778b. Nothing suggests that this national public\ninterest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign\nexchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the\ndissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securi\u00ad\nties traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot\novercome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is \u00a730(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778dd(b), which does mention the Act\u2019s extraterritorial\napplication: \u201cThe provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of\nany rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission \u201cto prevent . . .\nevasion of [the Act].\u201d (The parties have pointed us to no\nregulation promulgated pursuant to \u00a730(b).) The Solicitor\nGeneral argues that \u201c[this] exemption would have no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 This  conclusion does not render meaningless the inclusion of \u201ctrade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign\ncountry and any State\u201d in the definition of \u201cinterstate commerce.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose\nexecutives approve the publication in the United States of misleading\ninformation affecting the price of the issuer\u2019s securities traded on the\nNew York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumen\u00ad\ntality of \u201ccommunication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfunction if the Act did not apply in the first instance to\nsecurities transactions that occur abroad.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 14.\n   We are not convinced. In the first place, it would be odd\nfor Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of\nthe whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing\na condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the\nwhole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission\u2019s\nenabling regulations be limited to those preventing \u201ceva\u00ad\nsion\u201d of the Act, rather than all those preventing \u201cviola\u00ad\ntion\u201d? The provision seems to us directed at actions\nabroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might\ncause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to\nescape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General\u2019s\nproposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations\nof statutory language do not override the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253.\n   The Solicitor General also fails to account for \u00a730(a),\nwhich reads in relevant part as follows:\n       \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to\n    make use of the mails or of any means or instrumen\u00ad\n    tality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effect\u00ad\n    ing on an exchange not within or subject to the juris\u00ad\n    diction of the United States, any transaction in any\n    security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is or\u00ad\n    ganized under the laws of, or has its principal place of\n    business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdic\u00ad\n    tion of the United States, in contravention of such\n    rules and regulations as the Commission may pre\u00ad\n    scribe . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778dd(a).\nSubsection 30(a) contains what \u00a710(b) lacks: a clear\nstatement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision\nfor a specific extraterritorial application would be quite\nsuperfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied\nto transactions on foreign exchanges\u2014and its limitation of\n16       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat application to securities of domestic issuers would be\ninoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute\nprovides for some extraterritorial application, the pre\u00ad\nsumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,\n550 U. S. 437, 455\u2013456 (2007). No one claims that \u00a730(a)\napplies here.\n   The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar\u00ad\nrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies\nabroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see\npost, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to\nthink, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a\n\u201cclear statement rule,\u201d ibid., if by that is meant a re\u00ad\nquirement that a statute say \u201cthis law applies abroad.\u201d\nAssuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever\nsources of statutory meaning one consults to give \u201cthe\nmost faithful reading\u201d of the text, post, at 7, there is no\nclear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur\u00ad\nrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but\nmerely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica\u00ad\ntions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.\nAs the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to\nthe dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not\nsuffice.8\n   In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex\u00ad\nchange Act that \u00a710(b) applies extraterritorially, and we\ntherefore conclude that it does not.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic\u00ad\n\nitly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in\nAramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to\ngive a statute explicit extraterritorial effect\u2014and how to limit that\neffect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment\ndid. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, \u00a7109, 105 Stat. 1077.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              IV \n\n                               A\n\n   Petitioners argue that the conclusion that \u00a710(b) does\nnot apply extraterritorially does not resolve this case.\nThey contend that they seek no more than domestic appli\u00ad\ncation anyway, since Florida is where HomeSide and its\nsenior executives engaged in the deceptive conduct of\nmanipulating HomeSide\u2019s financial models; their com\u00ad\nplaint also alleged that Race and Hughes made misleading\npublic statements there. This is less an answer to the\npresumption against extraterritorial application than it is\nan assertion\u2014a quite valid assertion\u2014that that presump\u00ad\ntion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its\napplication requires further analysis. For it is a rare case\nof prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all\ncontact with the territory of the United States. But the\npresumption against extraterritorial application would be\na craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel\nwhenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.\nThe concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti\u00ad\nnel, see post, at 7\u20138, but our cases are to the contrary. In\nAramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired\nin Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,\nat 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that\nterritorial event nor that relationship was the \u201cfocus\u201d of\ncongressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic\nemployment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285\u2013\n286.\n   Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that\nthe focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where\nthe deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of\nsecurities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not\npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct \u201cin\nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security regis\u00ad\ntered on a national securities exchange or any security not\nso registered.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b). See SEC v. Zandford,\n18        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n535 U. S. 813, 820 (2002). Those purchase-and-sale trans\u00ad\nactions are the objects of the statute\u2019s solicitude. It is\nthose transactions that the statute seeks to \u201cregulate,\u201d see\nSuperintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty\nCo., 404 U. S. 6, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective\nparties to those transactions that the statute seeks to\n\u201cprotec[t],\u201d id., at 10.     See also Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976). And it is in our\nview only transactions in securities listed on domestic\nexchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,\nto which \u00a710(b) applies.9\n   The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by\nthe very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as\nits object \u201c[t]o provide for the regulation of securities\nexchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign com\u00ad\nmerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and\nunfair practices on such exchanges . . . .\u201d 48 Stat. 881. We\nknow of no one who thought that the Act was intended to\n\u201cregulat[e]\u201d foreign securities exchanges\u2014or indeed who\neven believed that under established principles of interna\u00ad\ntional law Congress had the power to do so. The Act\u2019s\nregistration requirements apply only to securities listed on\nnational securities exchanges. 15 U. S. C. \u00a778l(a).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The concurrence seems to think this test has little to do with our\nconclusion in Part III, supra, that \u00a710(b) does not apply extraterritori\u00ad\nally. See post, at 11\u201312. That is not so. If \u00a710(b) did apply abroad, we\nwould not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it\nwould apply to all of them (barring some other limitation). Thus,\nalthough it is true, as we have said, that our threshold conclusion that\n\u00a710(b) has no extraterritorial effect does not resolve this case, it is a\nnecessary first step in the analysis.\n   The concurrence also makes the curious criticism that our evaluation\nof where a putative violation occurs is based on the text of \u00a710(b) rather\nthan the doctrine in the Courts of Appeals. Post, at 1\u20132. Although it\nconcedes that our test is textually plausible, post, at 1, it does not (and\ncannot) make the same claim for the Court-of-Appeals doctrine it\nendorses. That is enough to make our test the better one.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The former extends the normal scope of the Ex\u00ad\nchange Act\u2019s prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of\nrules prescribed by the Commission, a \u201ctransaction\u201d in a\nUnited States security \u201con an exchange not within or\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \u00a778dd(a).\nAnd the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to \u201cany\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nCommission \u201cto prevent evasion [of the Act].\u201d \u00a778dd(b).\nUnder both provisions it is the foreign location of the\ntransaction that establishes (or reflects the presumption\nof) the Act\u2019s inapplicability, absent regulations by the\nCommission.\n  The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in\nthe Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the\nsame Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of\nthe same comprehensive regulation of securities trading.\nSee Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank\nof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 170\u2013171 (1994). That\nlegislation makes it unlawful to sell a security, through a\nprospectus or otherwise, making use of \u201cany means or\ninstruments of transportation or communication in inter\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 That   is in our view the meaning which the presumption against\nextraterritorial application requires for the words \u201cpurchase or sale, of\n. . . any security not so registered\u201d in \u00a710(b)\u2019s phrase \u201cin connection with\nthe purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities\nexchange or any security not so registered\u201d (emphasis added). Even\nwithout the presumption against extraterritorial application, the only\nalternative to that reading makes nonsense of the phrase, causing it to\ncover all purchases and sales of registered securities, and all purchases\nand sales of nonregistered securities\u2014a thought which, if intended,\nwould surely have been expressed by the simpler phrase \u201call purchases\nand sales of securities.\u201d\n20     MORRISON v.

S., at 256. Like\nthe United States, foreign countries regulate their domes\u00ad\ntic securities exchanges and securities transactions occur\u00ad\nring within their territorial jurisdiction. And the regula\u00ad\ntion of other countries often differs from ours as to what\nconstitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what\ndamages are recoverable, what discovery is available in\nlitigation, what individual actions may be joined in a\nsingle suit, what attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable, and many\nother matters.

Neither the Solicitor General nor\npetitioners provide any textual support for this test. The\nSolicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a\ntest would serve: achieving a high standard of business\nethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securi\u00ad\nties markets and thereby promoting investor confidence,\nand preventing the United States from becoming a \u201cBar\u00ad\nbary Coast\u201d for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign\nmarkets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\nBut it provides no textual support for the last of these\npurposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign\nsecurities industry and securities markets abroad. It is\nour function to give the statute the effect its language\nsuggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to\nadmirable purposes it might be used to achieve.\n   If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable\nconsequences of the \u201csignificant and material conduct\u201d\ntest, one should also be repulsed by its adverse conse\u00ad\nquences. While there is no reason to believe that the\nUnited States has become the Barbary Coast for those\nperpetrating frauds on foreign securities markets, some\nfear that it has become the Shangri-La of class-action\nlitigation for lawyers representing those allegedly cheated\n22      MORRISON v.

United States, 544 U. S. 349 (2005).11 In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Discussed in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22\u201323. The\n\nSolicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust\ncases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with conse\u00ad\nquences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply\nextraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon\nCorp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274\nU. S. 268 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66 (1917); United States\nv. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U. S. 87 (1913). These are no\nlonger of relevance to the point (if they ever were), since Continental\nOre overruled the holding of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,\n213 U. S. 347, 357 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extrater\u00ad\nritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics\nCorp. Int\u2019l, 493 U. S. 400, 407\u2013408 (1990).          Moreover, the pre-\nContinental Ore cases all involved conspiracies to restrain trade in the\nUnited States, see Sisal Sales, supra, at 274\u2013276; Thomsen, supra, at\n88; Pacific & Arctic, supra, at 105\u2013106. And although a final case cited\nby the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,\n287\u2013288 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterri\u00ad\ntorial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a\nviolation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at\nissue\u2014the Lanham Act\u2014to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v.\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 252 (1991) (quoting 15\nU. S. C. \u00a71127).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71343 (2009 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defen\u00ad\ndants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in\nMaryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and\ndeprive the Canadian Government of revenue. 544 U. S.,\nat 353, 371. Section 1343 prohibits \u201cany scheme or artifice\nto defraud,\u201d\u2014fraud simpliciter, without any requirement\nthat it be \u201cin connection with\u201d any particular transaction\nor event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners\u2019\n\u201coffense was complete the moment they executed the\nscheme inside the United States,\u201d and that it was \u201c[t]his\ndomestic element of petitioners\u2019 conduct [that] the Gov\u00ad\nernment is punishing.\u201d 544 U. S., at 371. Section 10(b),\nby contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only\nsuch acts \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any\nsecurity registered on a national securities exchange or\nany security not so registered.\u201d Not deception alone, but\ndeception with respect to certain purchases or sales is\nnecessary for a violation of the statute.\n   The Solicitor General points out that the \u201csignificant\nand material conduct\u201d test is in accord with prevailing\nnotions of international comity. If so, that proves that if\nthe United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursu\u00ad\nant to the \u201csignificant and material conduct\u201d test it would\nnot violate customary international law; but it in no way\ntends to prove that that is what Congress has done.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commis\u00ad\nsion has adopted an interpretation similar to the \u201csignifi\u00ad\ncant and material conduct\u201d test, and that we should defer\nto that. In the two adjudications the Solicitor General\ncites, however, the Commission did not purport to be\nproviding its own interpretation of the statute, but relied\non decisions of federal courts\u2014mainly Court of Appeals\ndecisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and\nLeasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed\nearlier.

This case involves no securities listed\non a domestic exchange, and all aspects of the purchases\ncomplained of by those petitioners who still have live\nclaims occurred outside the United States.

S. C. \u00a778j(b). In this case, the purchased securities are\nlisted only on a few foreign exchanges, none of which has\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission\nas a \u201cnational securities exchange.\u201d See \u00a778f. The first\ncategory therefore does not apply. Further, the relevant\npurchases of these unregistered securities took place\nentirely in Australia and involved only Australian inves\ntors. And in accordance with the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, I do not read the second category to\ninclude such transactions. Thus, while state law or other\nfederal fraud statutes, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71341 (mail\nfraud), \u00a71343 (wire fraud), may apply to the fraudulent\nactivity alleged here to have occurred in the United States,\nI believe that \u00a710(b) does not.

I would adhere to the general approach\nthat has been the law in the Second Circuit, and most of\nthe rest of the country, for nearly four decades.\n                              I\n    Today the Court announces a new \u201ctransactional test,\u201d\nante, at 21, for defining the reach of \u00a710(b) of the Securi\u00ad\nties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778j(b), and SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b)\n(2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to\n\u201ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges\n. . . and domestic transactions in other securities,\u201d ante, at\n18. If one confines one\u2019s gaze to the statutory text, the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion is a plausible one. But the federal\ncourts have been construing \u00a710(b) in a different manner\nfor a long time, and the Court\u2019s textual analysis is not\nnearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the aban\u00ad\ndonment of their doctrine.\n    The text and history of \u00a710(b) are famously opaque on\nthe question of when, exactly, transnational securities\n2        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrauds fall within the statute\u2019s compass. As those types of\nfrauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th\ncentury, the federal courts were increasingly called upon\nto wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit, located in the Nation\u2019s financial cen\u00ad\nter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum\nv. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev\u2019d on rehearing on other\ngrounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,\nover an extended series of cases, to \u201cdiscern\u201d under what\ncircumstances \u201cCongress would have wished the precious\nresources of the United States courts and law enforcement\nagencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,\u201d\n547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the\nSecond Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects\ntest. This test asks \u201c(1) whether the wrongful conduct\noccurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong\u00ad\nful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or\nupon United States citizens.\u201d Id., at 171. Numerous cases\nflesh out the proper application of each prong.\n   The Second Circuit\u2019s test became the \u201cnorth star\u201d of\n\u00a710(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but\nnationally as well. With minor variations, other courts\nconverged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 15 (\u201cThe courts have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See, e.g., IIT, Int\u2019l Inv.

This is true\neven when the defendant is organized under the laws of a foreign\ncountry, is conducting much of its activity outside the United States,\nand is therefore governed largely by foreign law\u201d (citing, inter alia,\nLeasco, 468 F. 2d, at 1334\u20131339, and Schoenbaum v.

It is the Court, however, that misap\u00ad\nplies the presumption, in two main respects.\n   First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption\nfrom a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a\nclear statement rule. We have been here before. In the\ncase on which the Court primarily relies, EEOC v. Ara\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991) (Aramco),\nChief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s majority opinion included a\nsentence that appeared to make the same move. See id.,\nat 258 (\u201cCongress\u2019 awareness of the need to make a clear\nstatement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon\u00ad\nstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex\u00ad\npressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a\nstatute\u201d). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob\u00ad\njected. See id., at 261 (\u201c[C]ontrary to what one would\nconclude from the majority\u2019s analysis, this canon is not a\n\u2018clear statement\u2019 rule, the application of which relieves a\ncourt of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the\nlegislative will\u201d).\n   Yet even Aramco\u2014surely the most extreme application\nof the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time\non the Court6\u2014contained numerous passages suggesting\nthat the presumption may be overcome without a clear\ndirective. See id., at 248\u2013255 (majority opinion) (repeat\u00ad\nedly identifying congressional \u201cintent\u201d as the touchstone of\nthe presumption). And our cases both before and after\nAramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to\ngive effect to \u201call available evidence about the meaning\u201d of\na provision when considering its extraterritorial applica\u00ad\ntion, lest we defy Congress\u2019 will.

Hence, while the Court\u2019s\ndictum that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of\nan extraterritorial application, it has none,\u201d ante, at 6,\nmakes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The\npresumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a\ntheory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in\u00ad\nternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It\ndoes not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the\nmost faithful reading possible.\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in\nsuggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial\u00ad\nity is fatal to the Second Circuit\u2019s test. For even if the\npresumption really were a clear statement (or \u201cclear indi\u00ad\ncation,\u201d ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal\nrelevance to this case.\n   It is true, of course, that \u201cthis Court ordinarily construes\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of\nSherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197,\n201\u2013204 (1993) (opinion for the Court by Rehnquist, C. J.) (considering\npresumption \u201c[l]astly,\u201d to resolve \u201cany lingering doubt,\u201d after consider\u00ad\ning structure, legislative history, and judicial interpretations of Federal\nTort Claims Act); cf. Sale, 509 U. S., at 188 (stating that presumption\n\u201chas special force when we are construing treaty and statutory provi\u00ad\nsions that,\u201d unlike \u00a710(b), \u201cmay involve foreign and military affairs for\nwhich the President has unique responsibility\u201d); Dodge, Understanding\nthe Presumption Against Extraterritoriality, 16 Berkeley J. Int\u2019l L. 85,\n110 (1998) (explaining that lower courts \u201chave been unanimous in\nconcluding that the presumption against extraterritoriality is not a\nclear statement rule\u201d). The Court also relies on Microsoft Corp. v.\nAT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 455\u2013456 (2007). Ante, at 16. Yet Micro\nsoft\u2019s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court\u2019s rigid\ntheory. \u201cAs a principle of general application,\u201d Microsoft innocuously\nobserved, \u201cwe have stated that courts should \u2018assume that legislators\ntake account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when\nthey write American laws.\u2019 \u201d 550 U. S., at 455 (quoting F. Hoffmann-La\nRoche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004)).\n8        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference\nwith the sovereign authority of other nations,\u201d\nF. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S.\n155, 164 (2004), and that, absent contrary evidence, we\npresume \u201cCongress is primarily concerned with domestic\nconditions,\u201d Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285\n(1949). Accordingly, the presumption against extraterrito\u00ad\nriality \u201cprovides a sound basis for concluding that Section\n10(b) does not apply when a securities fraud with no ef\u00ad\nfects in the United States is hatched and executed entirely\noutside this country.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 22. But that is just about all it provides a sound\nbasis for concluding. And the conclusion is not very illu\u00ad\nminating, because no party to the litigation disputes it.\nNo one contends that \u00a710(b) applies to wholly foreign\nfrauds.\n   Rather, the real question in this case is how much, and\nwhat kinds of, domestic contacts are sufficient to trigger\napplication of \u00a710(b).8 In developing its conduct-and\u00ad\neffects test, the Second Circuit endeavored to derive a\nsolution from the Exchange Act\u2019s text, structure, history,\nand purpose. Judge Friendly and his colleagues were well\naware that United States courts \u201ccannot and should not\nexpend [their] resources resolving cases that do not affect\nAmericans or involve fraud emanating from America.\u201d\n547 F. 3d, at 175; see also id., at 171 (overriding concern is\n\u201c \u2018whether there is sufficient United States involvement\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Itoba Ltd. v.

The text of the Exchange Act indicates that \u00a710(b)\nextends to at least some activities with an international\ncomponent, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9\nThe Second Circuit draws the line as follows: \u00a710(b) ex\u00ad\ntends to transnational frauds \u201conly when substantial acts\nin furtherance of the fraud were committed within the\nUnited States,\u201d SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2\n2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the\nfraud was \u201c \u2018intended to produce\u2019 \u201d and did produce \u201c \u2018det\u00ad\nrimental effects within\u2019 \u201d the United States, Schoenbaum,\n405 F. 2d, at 206.10\n  This approach is consistent with the understanding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 By  its terms, \u00a710(b) regulates \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778j, which the Exchange Act defines to include \u201ctrade, commerce,\ntransportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and\nany State, or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof.\u201d\n\u00a778c(a)(17). Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that\nCongress contemplated some amount of transnational application. See,\ne.g., \u00a778b(2) (stating, in explaining necessity for regulation, that \u201c[t]he\nprices established and offered in [securities] transactions are generally\ndisseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign\ncountries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the\nprices at which securities are bought and sold\u201d); \u00a778dd(b) (exempting\nfrom regulation foreign parties \u201cunless\u201d they transact business in\nsecurities \u201cin contravention of such rules and regulations as the Com\u00ad\nmission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the\nevasion of this chapter\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206\u2013208 (reviewing statutory text and legislative history).\nThe Court finds these textual references insufficient to overcome the\npresumption against extraterritoriality, ante, at 13\u201315, but as ex\u00ad\nplained in the main text, that finding rests upon the Court\u2019s misappli\u00ad\ncation of the presumption.\n   10 The Government submits that a \u201ctransnational securities fraud\n\nviolates Section 10(b) if significant conduct material to the fraud\u2019s\nsuccess occurs in the United States.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6. I understand the Government\u2019s submission to be largely a\nrepackaging of the \u201cconduct\u201d prong of the Second Circuit\u2019s test. The\nGovernment expresses no view on that test\u2019s \u201ceffects\u201d prong, as the\ndecision below considered only respondents\u2019 conduct. See id., at 15,\nn. 2; 547 F. 3d 167, 171 (CA2 2008).\n10     MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the\nExchange Act, \u201cexpected U.

I do\nnot take issue with the Court for beginning its inquiry\nwith the statutory text, rather than the doctrine in the\nCourts of Appeals. Cf. ante, at 18, n. 9. I take issue with\nthe Court for beginning and ending its inquiry with the\nstatutory text, when the text does not speak with geo\u00ad\ngraphic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of,\nand the persuasive account of congressional intent embod\u00ad\nied in, the Second Circuit\u2019s rule.\n   Repudiating the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in its en\u00ad\ntirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose\nprivate parties from bringing \u00a710(b) actions whenever the\nrelevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are\nnot listed on a domestic exchange.12 The real motor of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Given its focus on \u201cdomestic conditions,\u201d Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo,\n\n336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949), I expect that virtually all \u201c \u2018foreign-cubed\u2019 \u201d\nactions\u2014actions in which \u201c(1) foreign plaintiffs [are] suing (2) a foreign\nissuer in an American court for violations of American securities laws\nbased on securities transactions in (3) foreign countries,\u201d 547 F. 3d, at\n172\u2014would fail the Second Circuit\u2019s test. As they generally should.\nUnder these circumstances, the odds of the fraud having a substantial\nconnection to the United States are low. In recognition of the Exchange\nAct\u2019s focus on American investors and the novelty of foreign-cubed\nlawsuits, and in the interest of promoting clarity, it might have been\nappropriate to incorporate one bright line into the Second Circuit\u2019s test,\nby categorically excluding such lawsuits from \u00a710(b)\u2019s ambit.\n  12 The Court\u2019s opinion does not, however, foreclose the Commission\n\nfrom bringing enforcement actions in additional circumstances, as no\nissue concerning the Commission\u2019s authority is presented by this case.\nThe Commission\u2019s enforcement proceedings not only differ from private\n\u00a710(b) actions in numerous potentially relevant respects, see Brief for\n12       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt\u2019s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against\nextraterritoriality but rather the Court\u2019s belief that trans\u00ad\nactions on domestic exchanges are \u201cthe focus of the Ex\u00ad\nchange Act\u201d and \u201cthe objects of [its] solicitude.\u201d Ante, at\n17, 18. In reality, however, it is the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and\n\u201cthe interests of investors\u201d that are the objects of the\nstatute\u2019s solicitude.

Both of these investors would, under the\nCourt\u2019s new test, be barred from seeking relief under\n\u00a710(b).\n  The oddity of that result should give pause. For in\nwalling off such individuals from \u00a710(b), the Court nar\u00ad\nrows the provision\u2019s reach to a degree that would surprise\nand alarm generations of American investors\u2014and, I am\nconvinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.\nIndeed, the Court\u2019s rule turns \u00a710(b) jurisprudence (and\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head,\nby withdrawing the statute\u2019s application from cases in\nwhich there is both substantial wrongful conduct that\noccurred in the United States and a substantial injurious\neffect on United States markets and citizens.\n                             III\n   In my judgment, if petitioners\u2019 allegations of fraudulent\nmisconduct that took place in Florida are true, then re\u00ad\nspondents may have violated \u00a710(b), and could potentially\nbe held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought\nby the Commission. But it does not follow that sharehold\u00ad\ners who have failed to allege that the bulk or the heart of\nthe fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud\nhad an adverse impact on American investors or markets,\nmay maintain a private action to recover damages they\nsuffered abroad. Some cases involving foreign securities\ntransactions have extensive links to, and ramifications for,\nthis country; this case has Australia written all over it.\nAccordingly, for essentially the reasons stated in the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 opinion, I would affirm its judgment.\n   The Court instead elects to upend a significant area of\nsecurities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive,\n14     MORRISON v.
