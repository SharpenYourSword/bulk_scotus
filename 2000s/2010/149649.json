KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF \n\n  COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND \n\n    DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u2013964.      Argued November 9, 2009\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nPetitioners\u2019 patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention\n  that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy mar\n  ket can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key\n  claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how\n  to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a\n  simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how\n  claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consum\n  ers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\n  mand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds\n  that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely\n  manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical\n  problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and\n  affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court\n  rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention\n  was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101\u2014i.e.,\n  whether the invention produced a \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible re\n  sult,\u201d see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial\n  Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373\u2014holding instead that a claimed\n  process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or\n  apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different\n  state or thing. Concluding that this \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d\n  is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n  \u00a7101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not\n  patent eligible.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                          BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132, concluding that petitioners\u2019 claimed inven\n  tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4\u20138, 10\u201311, 12\u201316.\n     (a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions\n  or discoveries that are patent eligible: \u201cprocess[es],\u201d \u201cmachin[es],\u201d\n  \u201cmanufactur[es],\u201d and \u201ccomposition[s] of matter.\u201d \u201cIn choosing such\n  expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent\n  laws would be given wide scope,\u201d Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n  303, 308, in order to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuity should receive a liberal\n  encouragement,\u2019 \u201d id., at 308\u2013309. This Court\u2019s precedents provide\n  three specific exceptions to \u00a7101\u2019s broad principles: \u201claws of nature,\n  physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u201d Id., at 309. While not re\n  quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the\n  notion that a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d And, in\n  any case, the exceptions have defined the statute\u2019s reach as a matter\n  of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.\n  Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174. The \u00a7101 eligibility inquiry is only a\n  threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the\n  four categories, it must also satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements\n  of this title,\u201d \u00a7101(a), including novelty, see \u00a7102, nonobviousness, see\n  \u00a7103, and a full and particular description, see \u00a7112. The invention\n  at issue is claimed to be a \u201cprocess,\u201d which \u00a7100(b) defines as a \u201cproc\n  ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma\n  chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d Pp. 4\u20135.\n     (b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat\n  ent eligibility under \u00a7101. The Court\u2019s precedents establish that al\n  though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative\n  tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat\n  ent-eligible \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. In holding to the contrary, the\n  Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:\n  Courts \u201c \u2018should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi\n  tions which the legislature has not expressed,\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Diehr,\n  450 U. S. 175, 182, and, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, \u2018words will be in\n  terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean\n  ing,\u2019 \u201d ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,\n  common meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that would require it to be tied to a\n  machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di\n  rector urges the Court to read \u00a7101\u2019s other three patentable catego\n  ries as confining \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or transformation. However,\n  the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for \u00a7100(b) al\n  ready explicitly defines \u201cprocess,\u201d see Burgess v. United States, 553\n  U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section\u2019s inclusion of those\n  other categories suggests that a \u201cprocess\u201d must be tied to one of them.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nFinally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has\nendorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.\nRecent authorities show that the test was never intended to be ex\nhaustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588,\nn. 9. Pp. 5\u20138.\n   (c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term \u201cprocess\u201d\nthat would categorically exclude business methods.            The term\n\u201cmethod\u201d within \u00a7100(b)\u2019s \u201cprocess\u201d definition, at least as a textual\nmatter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and\nthis Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing\nbusiness. The Court is unaware of any argument that the \u201cordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning,\u201d Diehr, supra, at 182, of \u201cmethod\u201d\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method\nexception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies\nfor conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion\nargument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explic\nitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method pat\nents: Under \u00a7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based\non \u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a defense\nof prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges\nthat there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clari\nfies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of\n\u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patent\ning under \u00a7101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon\nagainst interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would\nrender another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while \u00a7273 appears to leave open the pos\nsibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad\npatentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10\u201311.\n   (d) Even though petitioners\u2019 application is not categorically outside\nof \u00a7101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today,\nthat does not mean it is a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. Petitioners seek to\npatent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, how\never, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent ab\nstract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and\nreduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpat\nentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and\nFlook. Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging\ncan be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent\nthe use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well\nknown random analysis techniques to help establish some of the in\nputs into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12\u2013\n4                            BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    15.\n      (e) Because petitioners\u2019 patent application can be rejected under\n    the Court\u2019s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the\n    Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable \u201cproc\n    ess,\u201d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in\n    \u00a7100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n    Nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal\n    Circuit\u2019s past interpretations of \u00a7101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,\n    at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the\n    machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case\n    law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting\n    business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or\n    transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limiting criteria that further\n    the Patent Act\u2019s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.\n    P. 16.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts II\u2013\nB\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132.

KAPPOS, UNDER \n\n      SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTEL- \n\n       LECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, \n\n        PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 28, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132.*\n   The question in this case turns on whether a patent can\nbe issued for a claimed invention designed for the business\nworld. The patent application claims a procedure for\ninstructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the\nrisk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ\nomy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition\nthat the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent\nlaw: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform\nan article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;\nand (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals\nruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma\nchine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used\nfor determining the patentability of a \u201cprocess\u201d under the\nPatent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SCALIA does not join Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132.\n2                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Petitioners\u2019 application seeks patent protection for a\nclaimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of\ncommodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,\nagainst the risk of price changes. The key claims are\nclaims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in\nstructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept\narticulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\nClaim 1 consists of the following steps:\n       \u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a\n    fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed\n    rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum\n    ers;\n       \u201c(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       \u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\nThe remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be\napplied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini\nmize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\nmand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims \u201c[t]he\nmethod of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and\nsaid market participants are transmission distributors.\u201d\nId., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar\nstatistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in\nclaim 4\u2019s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using\nwell-known random analysis techniques to determine how\nmuch a seller will gain \u201cfrom each transaction under each\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The Board of Patent Appeals and Interfer\nences affirmed, concluding that the application involved\nonly mental steps that do not transform physical matter\nand was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a\u2013186a.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case\nproduced five different opinions. Students of patent law\nwould be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.\n   Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The\ncourt rejected its prior test for determining whether a\nclaimed invention was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101\u2014whether it produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete, and tangi\nble result\u2019 \u201d\u2014as articulated in State Street Bank & Trust\nCo. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368,\n1373 (1998), and AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications,\nInc., 172 F. 3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See In re Bilski, 545\nF. 3d 943, 959\u2013960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).\nThe court held that \u201c[a] claimed process is surely patent\neligible under \u00a7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine\nor apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.\u201d Id., at 954. The court concluded\nthis \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d is \u201cthe sole test\ngoverning \u00a7101 analyses,\u201d id., at 955, and thus the \u201ctest\nfor determining patent eligibility of a process under \u00a7101,\u201d\nid., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,\nthe court held that petitioners\u2019 application was not patent\neligible. Id., at 963\u2013966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate\nconcurring opinion, providing historical support for the\n4                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt\u2019s approach. Id., at 966\u2013976.\n  Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer\nargued that petitioners\u2019 application was \u201cnot eligible for\npatent protection because it is directed to a method of\nconducting business.\u201d Id., at 998. He urged the adoption\nof a \u201ctechnological standard for patentability.\u201d Id., at\n1010. Judge Rader would have found petitioners\u2019 claims\nwere an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only\nJudge Newman disagreed with the court\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioners\u2019 application was outside of the reach of \u00a7101.\nShe did not say that the application should have been\ngranted but only that the issue should be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to determine whether the application\nqualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n                           A\n  Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be\npatented under the Patent Act:\n      \u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.\u201d\nSection 101 thus specifies four independent categories of\ninventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. \u201cIn choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by\nthe comprehensive \u2018any,\u2019 Congress plainly contemplated\nthat the patent laws would be given wide scope.\u201d Dia\nmond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308 (1980). Congress\ntook this permissive approach to patent eligibility to en\nsure that \u201c \u2018ingenuity should receive a liberal encourage\nment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 308\u2013309 (quoting 5 Writings of Thomas\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Washington ed. 1871)).\n   The Court\u2019s precedents provide three specific exceptions\nto \u00a7101\u2019s broad patent-eligibility principles: \u201claws of na\nture, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u201d Chakra\nbarty, supra, at 309. While these exceptions are not re\nquired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the\nnotion that a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d\nAnd, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach\nof the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going\nback 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174\u2013\n175 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are\n\u201cpart of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to\nall men and reserved exclusively to none.\u201d Funk Brothers\nSeed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).\n   The \u00a7101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold\ntest. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive\nthe Patent Act\u2019s protection the claimed invention must\nalso satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d\n\u00a7101. Those requirements include that the invention be\nnovel, see \u00a7102, nonobvious, see \u00a7103, and fully and par\nticularly described, see \u00a7112.\n   The present case involves an invention that is claimed\nto be a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. Section 100(b) defines \u201cproc\ness\u201d as:\n    \u201cprocess, art or method, and includes a new use of a\n    known process, machine, manufacture, composition of\n    matter, or material.\u201d\nThe Court first considers two proposed categorical limita\ntions on \u201cprocess\u201d patents under \u00a7101 that would, if\nadopted, bar petitioners\u2019 application in the present case:\nthe machine-or-transformation test and the categorical\nexclusion of business method patents.\n6                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 B\n                                 1\n   Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 formulation, an invention is\na \u201cprocess\u201d only if: \u201c(1) it is tied to a particular machine or\napparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.\u201d 545 F. 3d, at 954. This Court\nhas \u201cmore than once cautioned that courts \u2018should not read\ninto the patent laws limitations and conditions which the\nlegislature has not expressed.\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450\nU. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;\nsome internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as\nin all statutory construction, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined,\n\u2018words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con\ntemporary, common meaning.\u2019 \u201d Diehr, supra, at 182\n(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).\nThe Court has read the \u00a7101 term \u201cmanufacture\u201d in accor\ndance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,\nat 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,\n283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)), and approved a construction of the\nterm \u201ccomposition of matter\u201d consistent with common\nusage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308 (citing Shell Devel\nopment Co. v. Watson, 149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (DC 1957)).\n   Any suggestion in this Court\u2019s case law that the Patent\nAct\u2019s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only\nbeen an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature,\nphysical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 588\u2013589 (1978). This Court has not\nindicated that the existence of these well-established\nexceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose\nother limitations that are inconsistent with the text and\nthe statute\u2019s purpose and design. Concerns about at\ntempts to call any form of human activity a \u201cprocess\u201d can\nbe met by making sure the claim meets the requirements\nof \u00a7101.\n   Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Section 100(b) provides that \u201c[t]he\nterm \u2018process\u2019 means process, art or method, and includes\na new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.\u201d The Court is unaware\nof any \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d\nDiehr, supra, at 182, of the definitional terms \u201cprocess, art\nor method\u201d that would require these terms to be tied to a\nmachine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the\nCourt to look to the other patentable categories in \u00a7101\u2014\nmachines, manufactures, and compositions of matter\u2014to\nconfine the meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or trans\nformation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under\nthis canon, \u201can ambiguous term may be given more precise\ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associ\nated.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncanon is inapplicable here, for \u00a7100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term \u201cprocess.\u201d See Burgess v. United States,\n553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (\u201cWhen a statute includes an\nexplicit definition, we must follow that definition\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this\nCourt has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as\nthe exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener, 94\nU. S. 780, 788 (1877), explained that a \u201cprocess\u201d is \u201can act,\nor a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be\ntransformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\u201d\nMore recent cases, however, have rejected the broad impli\ncations of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority\nshows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or\nexclusive test. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 70\n(1972), noted that \u201c[t]ransformation and reduction of an\narticle \u2018to a different state or thing\u2019 is the clue to the pat\n8                     BILSKI v.

Flook took a similar approach, \u201cassum[ing] that a\nvalid process patent may issue even if it does not meet\n[the machine-or-transformation test].\u201d 437 U. S., at 588,\nn. 9.\n  This Court\u2019s precedents establish that the machine-or\ntransformation test is a useful and important clue, an\ninvestigative tool, for determining whether some claimed\ninventions are processes under \u00a7101. The machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for deciding\nwhether an invention is a patent-eligible \u201cprocess.\u201d\n                               2\n  It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy\nthe machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in\nearlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained\nby Judge Dyk\u2019s thoughtful historical review. See 545\nF. 3d, at 966\u2013976 (concurring opinion). But times change.\nTechnology and other innovations progress in unexpected\nways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that\nuntil recent times, \u201cwell-established principles of patent\nlaw probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid\npatent on almost any conceivable computer program.\u201d\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 195 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But\nthis fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such\nas computer programs are always unpatentable. See id.,\nat 192\u2013193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for\nmolding rubber that included a computer program is\nwithin patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a \u201cdy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions.\u201d J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 135 (2001).

S., at 315.\n   The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a\nsufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in\nthe Industrial Age\u2014for example, inventions grounded in a\nphysical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to\ndoubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for\ndetermining the patentability of inventions in the Infor\nmation Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the ma\nchine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as\nto the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medi\ncine techniques, and inventions based on linear program\nming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital\nsignals. See, e.g., Brief for Business Software Alliance 24\u2013\n25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al.\n14\u201327; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8\u201315;\nBrief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association\n17\u201322; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9\u201310.\n   In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation\ntest to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions\nof such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring\nthe larger object of securing patents for valuable inven\ntions without transgressing the public domain. The dis\nsent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.\n545 F. 3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previ\nously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable \u201cproc\ness[es],\u201d it may not make sense to require courts to confine\nthemselves to asking the questions posed by the machine\nor-transformation test. Section 101\u2019s terms suggest that\nnew technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson,\nsupra, at 71 (to \u201cfreeze process patents to old technologies,\nleaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing\ntechnology[,] . . . is not our purpose\u201d).\n   It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not\ncommenting on the patentability of any particular inven\n10                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned\ntechnologies from the Information Age should or should\nnot receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil\nity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises\nnew difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people\ntrying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for\ntheir inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in\nstriking the balance between protecting inventors and not\ngranting monopolies over procedures that others would\ndiscover by independent, creative application of general\nprinciples. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take\na position on where that balance ought to be struck.\n                               C\n                               1\n   Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention\nthat the term \u201cprocess\u201d categorically excludes business\nmethods. The term \u201cmethod,\u201d which is within \u00a7100(b)\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cprocess,\u201d at least as a textual matter and\nbefore consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and\nthis Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some meth\nods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining \u201cmethod\u201d as\n\u201c[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or\nmanner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure\nadopted in investigation or instruction\u201d). The Court is\nunaware of any argument that the \u201c \u2018ordinary, contempo\nrary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d Diehr, supra, at 182, of \u201cmethod\u201d\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro\nhibition on business method patents would reach, and\nwhether it would exclude technologies for conducting a\nbusiness more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and\nFinancial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56\nScottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (\u201cThere is no precise\ndefinition of . . . business method patents\u201d).\n   The argument that business methods are categorically\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Under 35 U. S. C.\n\u00a7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on\n\u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a\ndefense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,\n\u201cmethod\u201d is defined as \u201ca method of doing or conducting\nbusiness.\u201d \u00a7273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this\ndefense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be\nbusiness method patents. Section 273\u2019s definition of\n\u201cmethod,\u201d to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a\nprior-enacted statute. But what \u00a7273 does is clarify the\nunderstanding that a business method is simply one kind\nof \u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible\nfor patenting under \u00a7101.\n   A conclusion that business methods are not patentable\nin any circumstances would render \u00a7273 meaningless.\nThis would violate the canon against interpreting any\nstatutory provision in a manner that would render an\nother provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of\ncourse, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the\nU. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at\ndifferent times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus\ntrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529\u2013530 (1939) (opinion\nof Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta\ntion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the\nsubjective intent of various legislators in enacting the\nsubsequent provision. Finally, while \u00a7273 appears to\nleave open the possibility of some business method pat\nents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such\nclaimed inventions.\n                            2\n  Interpreting \u00a7101 to exclude all business methods sim\nply because business method patents were rarely issued\n12                   BILSKI v.

At the same time,\nsome business method patents raise special problems in\nterms of vagueness and suspect validity. See eBay Inc. v.\nMercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 397 (2006)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The Information Age empow\ners people with new capacities to perform statistical\nanalyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and\nsophistication that enable the design of protocols for more\nefficient performance of a vast number of business tasks.\nIf a high enough bar is not set when considering patent\napplications of this sort, patent examiners and courts\ncould be flooded with claims that would put a chill on\ncreative endeavor and dynamic change.\n   In searching for a limiting principle, this Court\u2019s prece\ndents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide\nuseful tools. See infra, at 12\u201315. Indeed, if the Court of\nAppeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category\nor class of patent applications that claim to instruct how\nbusiness should be conducted, and then rule that the\ncategory is unpatentable because, for instance, it repre\nsents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion\nmight well be in accord with controlling precedent. See\nibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent\nwith the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the\npossibility that there are at least some processes that can\nbe fairly described as business methods that are within\npatentable subject matter under \u00a7101.\n   Finally, even if a particular business method fits into\nthe statutory definition of a \u201cprocess,\u201d that does not mean\nthat the application claiming that method should be\ngranted.     In order to receive patent protection, any\nclaimed invention must be novel, \u00a7102, nonobvious, \u00a7103,\nand fully and particularly described, \u00a7112.

Petitioners seek to patent both\nthe concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. App. 19\u201320. Rather than\nadopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging\nand unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case\nnarrowly on the basis of this Court\u2019s decisions in Benson,\nFlook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners\u2019 claims are\nnot patentable processes because they are attempts to\npatent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court\nagree that the patent application at issue here falls out\nside of \u00a7101 because it claims an abstract idea.\n    In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli\ncation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal\nnumerals into pure binary code was a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101. 409 U. S., at 64\u201367. The Court first explained that\n\u201c \u2018[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an\noriginal cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no\none can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held\nthe application at issue was not a \u201cprocess,\u201d but an unpat\nentable abstract idea. \u201cIt is conceded that one may not\npatent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the\nresult if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure\nbinary numerals were patented in this case.\u201d 409 U. S., at\n71. A contrary holding \u201cwould wholly pre-empt the\nmathematical formula and in practical effect would be a\npatent on the algorithm itself.\u201d Id., at 72.\n    In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after\n14                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBenson. The applicant there attempted to patent a proce\ndure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic\nconversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. The application\u2019s only innovation was reliance\non a mathematical algorithm. 437 U. S., at 585\u2013586.\nFlook held the invention was not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d\nThe Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the\nalgorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still\nbe freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. 437 U. S., at 589\u2013590. Nevertheless, Flook\nrejected \u201c[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter\nhow conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an\nunpatentable principle into a patentable process.\u201d Id., at\n590. The Court concluded that the process at issue there\nwas \u201cunpatentable under \u00a7101, not because it contain[ed]\na mathematical algorithm as one component, but because\nonce that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior\nart, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no\npatentable invention.\u201d Id., at 594. As the Court later\nexplained, Flook stands for the proposition that the prohi\nbition against patenting abstract ideas \u201ccannot be circum\nvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a\nparticular technological environment\u201d or adding \u201cinsignifi\ncant postsolution activity.\u201d Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191\u2013192.\n  Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on\nthe principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The appli\ncation in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for\n\u201cmolding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured preci\nsion products,\u201d using a mathematical formula to complete\nsome of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U. S.,\nat 177. Diehr explained that while an abstract idea, law of\nnature, or mathematical formula could not be patented,\n\u201can application of a law of nature or mathematical for\nmula to a known structure or process may well be deserv\ning of patent protection.\u201d Id., at 187.

Finally, the Court concluded that\nbecause the claim was not \u201can attempt to patent a\nmathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial\nprocess for the molding of rubber products,\u201d it fell within\n\u00a7101\u2019s patentable subject matter. Id., at 192\u2013193.\n   In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners\u2019\napplication is not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d Claims 1 and 4\nin petitioners\u2019 application explain the basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk: \u201cHedging is a funda\nmental economic practice long prevalent in our system of\ncommerce and taught in any introductory finance class.\u201d\n545 F. 3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g., D.\nChorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instru\nments 75\u201394 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &\nJ. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Con\ncepts, Methods, and Uses 581\u2013582 (13th ed. 2010); S.\nRoss, R. Westerfield, & B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Cor\nporate Finance 743\u2013744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of\nhedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathemati\ncal formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,\njust like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\nAllowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre\nempt use of this approach in all fields, and would effec\ntively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.\n   Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims are broad examples of how\nhedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.\nFlook established that limiting an abstract idea to one\nfield of use or adding token postsolution components did\nnot make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the\nremaining claims in petitioners\u2019 application do. These\nclaims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of\nhedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the\n16                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of well-known random analysis techniques to help\nestablish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,\nthese claims add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook\ninvention was at least directed to the narrower domain of\nsignaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.\n                         *    *    *\n   Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita\ntions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act\u2019s\ntext. The patent application here can be rejected under\nour precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.\nThe Court, therefore, need not define further what consti\ntutes a patentable \u201cprocess,\u201d beyond pointing to the defini\ntion of that term provided in \u00a7100(b) and looking to the\nguideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n   And nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be read as endors\ning interpretations of \u00a7101 that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.\nIt may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to\nmake the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre\ncisely because its case law had not adequately identified\nless extreme means of restricting business method pat\nents, including (but not limited to) application of our\nopinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an\nexclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means\nforeclose the Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limit\ning criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act\nand are not inconsistent with its text.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The only question presented\nin this case is whether the so-called machine-or\ntransformation test is the exclusive test for what consti\ntutes a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. It\nwould be possible to answer that question simply by hold\ning, as the entire Court agrees, that although the ma\nchine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is\nnot the exclusive test.\n   I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty\nthat currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide\nfurther guidance. But I would take a different approach.\nRather than making any broad statements about how to\ndefine the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 or tinkering with the\nbounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I\nwould restore patent law to its historical and constitu\ntional moorings.\n   For centuries, it was considered well established that a\nseries of steps for conducting business was not, in itself,\n2                         BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npatentable. In the late 1990\u2019s, the Federal Circuit and\nothers called this proposition into question. Congress\nquickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a\nstopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant\nnew problem for the business community. It passed the\nFirst Inventors Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat.\n1501A\u2013555 (codified at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7273), which provides a\nlimited defense to claims of patent infringement, see\n\u00a7273(b), for \u201cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\u201d\n\u00a7273(a)(3). Following several more years of confusion, the\nFederal Circuit changed course, overruling recent deci\nsions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a\npatentable process only if it is tied to a machine or trans\nforms an article into a different state or thing. This \u201cma\nchine-or-transformation test\u201d excluded general methods of\ndoing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other\nsubjects that could be called processes.\n  The Court correctly holds that the machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes\na patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.1 But the\nCourt is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any\nseries of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of\nnature may constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7101. The language in the Court\u2019s opinion to this effect\ncan only cause mischief. The wiser course would have\nbeen to hold that petitioners\u2019 method is not a \u201cprocess\u201d\nbecause it describes only a general method of engaging in\nbusiness transactions\u2014and business methods are not\npatentable.     More precisely, although a process is not\npatent-ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting\nbusiness, a claim that merely describes a method of doing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even if the machine-or-transformation test may not define the scope\n\nof a patentable process, it would be a grave mistake to assume that\nanything with a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d State Street\nBank & Trust v.

The general method, described in Claim 1, entails\n\u201cmanaging the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold\nby a commodity provider at a fixed price,\u201d and consists of\nthe following steps:\n       \u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at\n    a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said\n    fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said\n    consumers;\n       \u201c(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       \u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\n   Although the patent application makes clear that the\n\u201cmethod can be used for any commodity to manage con\nsumption risk in a fixed bill price product,\u201d id., at 11, it\nincludes specific applications of the method, particularly\nin the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and\nconsumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctua\ntions in demand during specified time periods. See id., at\n20\u201322. Energy suppliers and consumers may use that\n4                     BILSKI v.

The patent\napplication describes a series of steps, including the\nevaluation of historical costs and weather variables and\nthe use of economic and statistical formulas, to analyze\nthese data and to estimate the likelihood of certain out\ncomes. See id., at 12\u201319.\n   The patent examiner rejected petitioners\u2019 application on\nthe ground that it \u201cis not directed to the technological\narts,\u201d insofar as it \u201cis not implemented on a specific appa\nratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and\nsolves a purely mathematical problem without any limita\ntion to a practical application.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.\n   The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board)\naffirmed the examiner\u2019s decision, but it rejected the posi\ntion that a patentable process must relate to \u201ctechnologi\ncal arts\u201d or be performed on a machine. Id., at 180a\u2013181a.\nInstead, the Board denied petitioners\u2019 patent on two alter\nnative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent\ninvolves only mental steps that do not transform physical\nsubject matter, id., at 181a\u2013184a; and, second, that it is\ndirected to an \u201cabstract idea,\u201d id., at 184a\u2013187a.\n   Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit.

In re Bilski,\n545 F. 3d 943, 959\u2013960 (2008). Relying on several of our\ncases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim\non a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d from a claim on a \u201cprocess,\u201d\nthe court concluded that a \u201cclaimed process is surely pat\nent-eligible under \u00a7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular\nmachine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular\narticle into a different state or thing.\u201d Id., at 954\u2013955.\nThe court further concluded that this \u201cmachine-or\ntransformation test\u201d is \u201cthe sole test governing \u00a7101\nanalyses,\u201d id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the\n\u201ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under\n\u00a7101,\u201d id., at 956.

Judge Newman urged that the en banc\ncourt\u2019s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text\nand history of \u00a7101, id., at 977\u2013978, 985\u2013990, is in tension\nwith several of decisions by this Court, id., at 978\u2013985,\nand the Federal Circuit, id., at 990\u2013992, and will invali\ndate thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on\nthose decisions, id., at 992\u2013994.\n                              II\n   Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this\ncase, I will comment briefly on the Court\u2019s opinion. The\nopinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and,\nif misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled\nareas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be\nclarifying.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent\nAct must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not\nas they have traditionally been understood in the context\nof patent law. See, e.g., ante, at 6 (terms in \u00a7101 must be\nviewed in light of their \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning\u2019 \u201d); ante, at 10 (patentable \u201cmethod\u201d is any \u201cor\nderly procedure or process,\u201d \u201cregular way or manner of\ndoing anything,\u201d or \u201cset form of procedure adopted in\ninvestigation or instruction\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III,\ninfra, if this portion of the Court\u2019s opinion were taken\nliterally, the results would be absurd: Anything that con\nstitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it\nis novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity. But\nthe opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The\nCourt makes this clear when it accepts that the \u201catextual\u201d\nmachine-or-transformation test, ante, at 12, is \u201cuseful and\nimportant,\u201d ante, at 8, even though it \u201cviolates\u201d the stated\n\u201cstatutory interpretation principles,\u201d ante, at 6; and when\nthe Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt com\nmonly used ideas, see ante, at 14\u201315.\n   Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue\npresented to us, the opinion uses some language that\nseems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentabil\nity. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests\nthat these criteria may operate differently when address\ning technologies of a recent vintage. See ante, at 8\u20139\n(machine-or-transformation test is useful \u201cfor evaluating\nprocesses similar to those in the Industrial Age,\u201d but is\nless useful \u201cfor determining the patentability of inventions\nin the Information Age\u201d). In moments of caution, however,\nthe opinion for the Court explains\u2014correctly\u2014that the\nCourt is merely restoring the law to its historical state of\nrest. See ante, at 8 (\u201cThis Court\u2019s precedents establish\nthat the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and\n8                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nimportant clue, an investigative tool, for determining\nwhether some claimed inventions are processes under\n\u00a7101 \u201d). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I under\nstand the Court\u2019s opinion to hold only that the machine-or\ntransformation test remains an important test for pat\nentability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be\nevaluated using these criteria.\n   Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the\nquestions presented\u2014whether the particular series of\nsteps in petitioners\u2019 application is an abstract idea\u2014the\nCourt uses language that could suggest a shift in our\napproach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that\npetitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does\nnot show how this conclusion follows \u201cclear[ly],\u201d ante, at\n15, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for\n\u201c[a] principle, in the abstract,\u201d or a \u201cfundamental truth.\u201d\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 589 (1978) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phe\nnomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by\nthe mathematical formula at issue in Gottschalk v. Ben\nson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972), and in Flook.\n   The Court construes petitioners\u2019 claims on processes for\npricing as claims on \u201cthe basic concept of hedging, or\nprotecting against risk,\u201d ante, at 14, and thus discounts\nthe application\u2019s discussion of what sorts of data to use,\nand how to analyze those data, as mere \u201ctoken postsolu\ntion components,\u201d ante, at 15. In other words, the Court\nartificially limits petitioners\u2019 claims to hedging, and then\nconcludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a\nterm that describes a category of processes including\npetitioners\u2019 claims. Why the Court does this is never\nmade clear. One might think that the Court\u2019s analysis\nmeans that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is\nitself an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never\nsuggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of\npatentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat petitioners\u2019 application is phrased broadly. See ante,\nat 14\u201315. But claim specification is covered by \u00a7112, not\n\u00a7101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable\nidea merely because it was described without sufficient\nspecificity, the Court could be calling into question some of\nour own prior decisions.2 At points, the opinion suggests\nthat novelty is the clue. See ante, at 14. But the fact that\nhedging is \u201c \u2018long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d\nibid., cannot justify the Court\u2019s conclusion, as \u201cthe proper\nconstruction of \u00a7101 . . . does not involve the familiar\nissu[e] of novelty\u201d that arises under \u00a7102. Flook, 437\nU. S., at 588. At other points, the opinion for a plurality\nsuggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent\ninvolved. See, e.g., ante, at 12 (courts should use the\nabstract-idea rule as a \u201ctoo[l]\u201d to set \u201ca high enough bar\u201d\n\u201cwhen considering patent applications of this sort\u201d). But\nwe have never in the past suggested that the inquiry\nvaries by subject matter.\n  The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account\nof what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. In\ndeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially\nasserts its conclusion that petitioners\u2019 application claims\nan abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof)\nmay have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it\nalso means that the Court\u2019s musings on this issue stand\nfor very little.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For example, a rule that broadly-phrased claims cannot constitute\npatentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander\nGraham Bell\u2019s famous fifth claim on \u201c \u2018[t]he method of, and apparatus\nfor, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein\ndescribed, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the\nvibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds,\nsubstantially as set forth,\u2019 \u201d The Telephone Cases, 126 U.

But, this definition is not especially help\nful, given that it also uses the term \u201cprocess\u201d and is there\nfore somewhat circular.\n   As lay speakers use the word \u201cprocess,\u201d it constitutes\nany series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as\nused in \u00a7101, the term does not refer to a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the\nordinary sense of the word,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 588; see\nalso Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 268 (1854) (\u201c[T]he\nterm process is often used in a more vague sense, in which\nit cannot be the subject of a patent\u201d). Rather, as discussed\nin some detail in Part IV, infra, the term \u201cprocess\u201d (along\nwith the definitions given to that term) has long accumu\nlated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term\nwas used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended\nnor understood to encompass any series of steps or any\nway to do any thing.\n   With that understanding in mind, the Government has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court quotes our decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n303 (1980), for the proposition that, \u201c \u2018[i]n choosing such expansive\nterms . . . modified by the comprehensive \u201cany,\u201d Congress plainly\ncontemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 4. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in\nChakrabarty: the terms \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201ccomposition of matter.\u201d\nSee 447 U. S., at 308 (\u201cIn choosing such expansive terms as \u2018manufac\nture\u2019 and \u2018composition of matter,\u2019 modified by the comprehensive \u2018any,\u2019\nCongress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given\nwide scope\u201d). As discussed herein, Congress\u2019 choice of the term \u201cproc\ness\u201d reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of\nsteps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to\ncodify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the\ncase with the terms at issue in Chakrabarty.\n12                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued that because \u201ca word\u201d in a statute \u201cis given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it\u201d\nassociates, United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294\n(2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that \u201c[t]he\nother three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject\nmatter identified in Section 101\u2014\u2018machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter\u2019\u2014all \u2018are things made by man,\nand involve technology.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 26. Spe\ncifically, the Government submits, we may infer \u201cthat the\nterm \u2018process\u2019 is limited to technological and industrial\nmethods.\u201d Ibid. The Court rejects this submission cate\ngorically, on the ground that \u201c\u00a7100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6. But \u00a7100(b) de\nfines the term \u201cprocess\u201d by using the term \u201cprocess,\u201d as\nwell as several other general terms. This is not a case,\nthen, in which we must either \u201cfollow\u201d a definition, ante, at\n7, or rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of\nan ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very\nambiguous term that we must define.\n   In my view, the answer lies in between the Govern\nment\u2019s and the Court\u2019s positions: The terms adjacent to\n\u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 provide a clue as to its meaning, al\nthough not a very strong clue. Section 101\u2019s list of catego\nries of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunc\ntive, suggesting that the term \u201cprocess\u201d has content\ndistinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore\nbe illogical to \u201crob\u201d the word \u201cprocess\u201d of all independent\nmeaning. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338\n(1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences\nabout what is a \u201cprocess\u201d from common attributes in \u00a7101,\nit is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a per\nceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts\nat work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely con\nfirming our preconceived notions of what should be pat\nentable or of seeing common attributes that track \u201cthe\nfamiliar issues of novelty and obviousness\u201d that arise\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunder other sections of the statute but are not relevant to\n\u00a7101, Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. The placement of \u201cprocess\u201d\nnext to other items thus cannot prove that the term is\nlimited to any particular categories; it does, however, give\nreason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable \u201cproc\ness\u201d extends to cover any series of steps at all.\n   The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As\nbriefly discussed in Part II, supra, the Court at points\nappears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term\n\u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 is not a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the ordinary sense\nof the word,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. Instead, the Court\nposits that the word \u201cprocess\u201d must be understood in light\nof its \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d ante, at\n6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a\nfine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a\ndeeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex\nterms of art developed against a particular historical\nbackground.4 Indeed, the approach would render \u00a7101\nalmost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of\ndance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe\neven words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of\ntyping letters or uttering sounds\u2014all would be patent\neligible. I am confident that the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 is\nnot nearly so capacious.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act accord\n\ning to the Act\u2019s plain text, it could prohibit \u201cthe entire body of private\ncontract,\u201d National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435\nU. S. 679, 688 (1978).\n  5 The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that\n\nthese \u201c[c]oncerns\u201d \u201ccan be met by making sure that the claim meets the\nrequirements of \u00a7101.\u201d Ante, at 6. Because the only limitation on the\nplain meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the\nbar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this\nlimitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity\nand patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for\nabsurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of\nnovelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.\n14                       BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredi\nble about the Court\u2019s stated method of interpreting \u00a7101\n(other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible\nunder the Court\u2019s theory of \u00a7101) is that the Court devi\nates from its own professed commitment to \u201cordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning.\u201d As noted earlier, the\nCourt accepts a role for the \u201catextual\u201d machine-or\ntransformation \u201cclue.\u201d Ante, at 12, 7. The Court also\naccepts that we have \u201cforeclose[d] a purely literal reading\nof \u00a7101,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims\nthat are close to \u201claws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas,\u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185\n(1981), do not count as \u201cprocesses\u201d under \u00a7101, even if\nthey can be colloquially described as such.6 The Court\nattempts to justify this latter exception to \u00a7101 as \u201ca\nmatter of statutory stare decisis.\u201d Ante, at 5. But it is\nstrange to think that the very same term must be inter\npreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its his\ntorical usage on others.\n  In fact, the Court\u2019s understanding of \u00a7101 is even more\nremarkable because its willingness to exclude general\nprinciples from the provision\u2019s reach is in tension with its\napparent willingness to include steps for conducting busi\nness. The history of patent law contains strong norms\nagainst patenting these two categories of subject matter.\nBoth norms were presumably incorporated by Congress\ninto the Patent Act in 1952.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCf. ante, at 12\u201313 (plurality opinion). A great deal of human activity\nwas at some time novel and nonobvious.\n   6 Curiously, the Court concedes that \u201cthese exceptions are not re\n\nquired by the statutory text,\u201d but urges that \u201cthey are consistent with\nthe notion that a patentable process must be \u2018new and useful.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 5 (emphasis added). I do not see how these exceptions find a textual\nhome in the term \u201cnew and useful.\u201d The exceptions may be consistent\nwith those words, but they are sometimes inconsistent with the \u201cordi\nnary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d ante, at 6, 10 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), of the words \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201cmethod.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

As I read the history, it\nstrongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing\nbusiness is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101.\n  I am, of course, mindful of the fact that \u00a7101 \u201cis a dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions,\u201d and that one must therefore view his\ntorical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an\nappropriately high level of generality. J. E. M. Ag Supply,\n534 U. S., at 135; see also Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 315\u2013\n316. But it is nonetheless significant that while people\nhave long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing\nbusiness fall outside of the subject matter that has \u201chis\ntorically been eligible to receive the protection of our\npatent laws,\u201d Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond\nwhat the modern patent \u201cstatute was enacted to protect,\u201d\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 593. It is also significant that when\nCongress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against\nthe background of a well-settled understanding that a\nseries of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.\nThese considerations ought to guide our analysis. As\nJustice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, \u201ca page of\nhistory is worth a volume of logic.\u201d New York Trust Co. v.\nEisner, 256 U.

Campin, Law\nof Patents for Inventions 11 (1869) (emphasis deleted),\nand English courts construed the phrase \u201cworking or\nmaking of any manner of new manufactures\u201d to encom\npass manufacturing processes, see, e.g., Boulton v.

Three years later, Congress\npassed the Patent Act of 1793 and slightly modified the\nlanguage to cover \u201cany new and useful art, machine,\nmanufacture or composition of matter, or any new and\nuseful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or\ncomposition of matter.\u201d 1 Stat. 319.\n   The object of the constitutional patent power and the\nstatutory authorization for process patents in the early\npatent Acts was the term \u201cuseful art.\u201d It is not evident\nfrom the face of the statutes or the Constitution whether\nthe objects of the patent system were \u201carts\u201d that are also\nuseful, or rather a more specific category, the class of arts\nknown as \u201cuseful arts.\u201d Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 12\n(describing the \u201c \u2018new and useful\u2019 tests which have always\nexisted in the statutory scheme\u201d and apply to all catego\nries of subject matter). However, we have generally as\nsumed that \u201cuseful art,\u201d at least as it is used in the Patent\nAct, is itself a term of art. See Burden, 15 How., at 267\u2013\n268.\n   The word \u201cart\u201d and the phrase \u201cuseful arts\u201d are subject\nto many meanings. There is room on the margins to de\nbate exactly what qualifies as either. There is room,\nmoreover, to debate at what level of generality we should\nunderstand these broad and historical terms, given that\n\u201c[a] rule that unanticipated inventions are without protec\ntion would conflict with the core concept of the patent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nD.

It appears, however,\nthat regardless of how one construes the term \u201cuseful\narts,\u201d business methods are not included.\n   Noah Webster\u2019s first American dictionary26 defined the\nterm \u201cart\u201d as the \u201cdisposition or modification of things by\nhuman skill, to answer the purpose intended,\u201d and differ\nentiated between \u201cuseful or mechanic\u201d arts, on the one\nhand, and \u201cliberal or polite\u201d arts, on the other. 1 An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828)\n(facsimile edition) (emphasis added). Although other\ndictionaries defined the word \u201cart\u201d more broadly,27 Web\nster\u2019s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the\nmeaning of the word \u201cmanufactures\u201d in the earlier English\nstatute. And we know that the term \u201cuseful arts\u201d was\nused in the founding era to refer to manufacturing and\nsimilar applied trades.28 See Coulter, The Field of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   26 Some scholars suggest that Webster\u2019s \u201cclose proximity to the Con\n\nstitutional Convention coupled with his familiarity with the delegates\nmakes it likely that he played some indirect role in the development\u201d of\nthe Constitution\u2019s Intellectual Property Clause\u2014a Clause that estab\nlished not only the power to create patents but also copyrights, a\nsubject in which Webster had great interest. Donner, Copyright Clause\nof the U. S. Constitution: Why Did the Framers Include It With\nUnanimous Approval? 36 Am. J. Legal. Hist. 361, 372 (1992). But\nthere is no direct evidence of this fact. See Walterscheid, Background\nand Origin 40\u201341.\n   27 See, e.g., 1 S.

Indeed, the same delegate to the Constitu\ntional Convention who gave an address in which he listed\ntriumphs in the useful arts distinguished between those\narts and the conduct of business. He explained that inves\ntors were now attracted to the \u201cmanufactures and the\nuseful arts,\u201d much as they had long invested in \u201ccom\nmerce, navigation, stocks, banks, and insurance compa\nnies.\u201d T. Coxe, A Statement of the Arts and Manufactures\nof the United States of America for the Year 1810, (1814),\nin 2 American State Papers, Finance 666, 688 (1832).\n   Some scholars have remarked, as did Thomas Jefferson,\nthat early patent statutes neither included nor reflected\nany serious debate about the precise scope of patentable\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntry, physics, and the like; to make a distinctive contribution to scientific\nknowledge\u201d); In re Waldbaum, 457 F. 2d 997, 1003 (CCPA 1972) (Rich,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c \u2018The phrase \u201ctechnological arts,\u201d as we have used it, is\nsynonymous with the phrase \u201cuseful arts\u201d as it appears in Article I,\nSection 8 of the Constitution\u2019 \u201d); Paulik v.

See, e.g., Graham, 383 U. S., at 9\u201310\n(discussing Thomas Jefferson\u2019s observations). It has been\nsuggested, however, that \u201c[p]erhaps this was in part a\nfunction of an understanding\u2014shared widely among\nlegislators, courts, patent office officials, and inventors\u2014\nabout what patents were meant to protect. Everyone\nknew that manufactures and machines were at the core of\nthe patent system.\u201d Merges, Property Rights for Business\nConcepts and Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech.\nL. J. 577, 585 (1999) (hereinafter Merges). Thus, although\ncertain processes, such as those related to the technology\nof the time, might have been considered patentable, it is\npossible that \u201c[a]gainst this background, it would have\nbeen seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent\u201d\non methods of conducting business. Ibid.\nDevelopment of American Patent Law\n   During the first years of the patent system, no patents\nwere issued on methods of doing business.30 Indeed, for\nsome time, there were serious doubts as to \u201cthe patentabil\nity of processes per se,\u201d as distinct from the physical end\nproduct or the tools used to perform a process. Id., at 581\u2013\n582.31\n   Thomas Jefferson was the \u201c \u2018first administrator of our\npatent system\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe author of the 1793 Patent Act.\u201d\nGraham, 383 U. S., at 7. We have said that his \u201cconclu\nsions as to conditions of patentability . . . are worthy of\nnote.\u201d Ibid. at 7.

S. 780\n\n(1877), in which we held that \u201ca process may be patentable irrespective\nof the particular form of the instrumentalities used,\u201d and therefore one\nmay patent \u201can act, or series of acts, performed upon the subject matter\nto be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\u201d Id., at 788.\n26                      BILSKI v.

He drafted the 1793 Act,\nid., at 7, and, years later, explained that in that Act \u201c \u2018the\nwhole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into\na system, under which every one might know when his\nactions were safe and lawful,\u2019 \u201d id., at 10 (quoting Letter to\nIssac McPherson, in VI Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181\u2013\n182 (H.

S., at 10. Thus \u201c[a]lthough the\nPatent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50\ntimes between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear\u201d of\nadding statutory requirements of patentability. Ibid. For\nnearly 160 years, Congress retained the term \u201cuseful arts,\u201d\nsee, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving\n\u201cwide latitude for judicial construction . . . to keep pace\nwith industrial development,\u201d Berman, Method Claims, 17\nJ. Pat. Off.

The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied.\nBut there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta:\nBusiness methods are not patentable arts. See, e.g.,\nUnited States Credit Sys. Co. v.

Indeed, if that were so, then\nour many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process\nwere simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to\naccept that errant piece of legislative history as widening\nthe scope of the patent law would contradict other evi\ndence in the congressional record, as well as our presump\ntion that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of\n\u201cprocess\u201d and did not expand it, see Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n184.\n   Taken in context, it is apparent that the quoted lan\nguage has a far less expansive meaning. The full sentence\nin the Committee Reports reads: \u201cA person may have\n\u2018invented\u2019 a machine or a manufacture, which may include\nanything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi\ntions of [this] title are fulfilled.\u201d S. Rep. 1979, at 5; H. R.\nRep. 1923, at 6. Viewed as a whole, it seems clear that\nthis language does not purport to explain that \u201canything\nunder the sun\u201d is patentable. Indeed, the language may\nbe understood to state the exact opposite: that \u201c[a] person\nmay have \u2018invented\u2019 . . . anything under the sun,\u201d but that\nthing \u201cis not necessarily patentable under section 101.\u201d\nThus, even in the Chakrabarty opinion, which relied on\nthis quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not\n\u201csuggest that \u00a7101 has no limits or that it embraces every\ndiscovery.\u201d 447 U. S., at 309.\n   Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Re\nports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of\n\u00a7101, it did not purport to define the term \u201cprocess.\u201d The\nlanguage refers only to \u201cmanufacture[s]\u201d and \u201cmachine[s],\u201d\ntangible objects \u201cmade by man.\u201d It does not reference the\n\u201cprocess\u201d category of subject matter (nor could a process be\ncomfortably described as something \u201cmade by man\u201d).

If anything, the Act appears to have codified\nthe conclusion that subject matter which was understood\nnot to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.\n    Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of\nsteps for conducting business is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never\nruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business\nmethods. But we have cast significant doubt on that\nproposition by giving substantial weight to the machine\nor-transformation test, as general methods of doing busi\nness do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of\nthis Court have noted that patents on business methods\nare of \u201csuspect validity.\u201d eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L.\nC., 547 U.

Although it may be difficult to define with\nprecision what is a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101, the\nhistorical clues converge on one conclusion: A business\nmethod is not a \u201cprocess.\u201d And to the extent that there is\nambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. \u201c[W]e\n34                    BILSKI v.

Brief for\nPetitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of\nstatutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the\n1999 Act.\n   In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti\nmated business methods could be patented, see State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit\nthe potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi\nfied at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7273, which provides a limited defense\nto claims of patent infringement, see \u00a7273(b), regarding\ncertain \u201cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\u201d\n\u00a7273(a)(3).\n   It is apparent, both from the content and history of the\nAct, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street\n(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading\nof State Street). The Act merely limited one potential\neffect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find\nthemselves liable for innocently using methods they as\nsumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to\namend the limitations in \u00a7101 on eligible subject matter.\nIndeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,\nwhich addresses \u201cPatents and Protection of Patent\nRights,\u201d rather than in Part II, which contains \u00a7101 and\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 184, we should be loath to conclude\nthat Congress effectively amended \u00a7101 without saying so\nclearly. We generally presume that Congress \u201cdoes not,\none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman\nv. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468\n(2001).\n   The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999\nlegislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.\n\u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,\u201d however, \u201cform a\nhazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d\nUnited States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a\nlater statute is offered as \u201can expression of how the . . .\nCongress interpreted a statute passed by another Con\ngress . . . a half century before,\u201d \u201csuch interpretation has\nvery little, if any, significance.\u201d Rainwater v. United\nStates, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).\n   Furthermore, even assuming that Congress\u2019 views at\nthe turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a\nvalid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid\n20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid\npetitioners because it does not show that the later Con\ngress itself understood \u00a7101 to cover business methods. If\nanything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir\ncuit understood \u00a7101 in that manner and that Congress\nunderstood what those judges had done. The Act appears\nto reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business\nmethods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow\ning State Street, congressional authorities lamented that\n\u201cbusiness methods and processes . . . until recently were\nthought not to be patentable,\u201d H. R. Rep.

Nevertheless, I think that this balance\ngenerally supports the historic understanding of the term\n\u201cprocess\u201d as excluding business methods. And a categori\ncal analysis fits with the purpose, as Thomas Jefferson\nexplained, of ensuring that \u201c \u2018every one might know when\nhis actions were safe and lawful,\u2019 \u201d Graham, 383 U.

Although there\nis certainly disagreement about the need for patents,\nscholars generally agree that when innovation is expen\nsive, risky, and easily copied, inventors are less likely to\nundertake the guaranteed costs of innovation in order to\nobtain the mere possibility of an invention that others can\ncopy.45 Both common sense and recent economic scholar\nship suggest that these dynamics of cost, risk, and reward\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  45 See generally W.

Although counterfactuals are a dubious form\nof analysis, I find it hard to believe that many of our en\ntrepreneurs forwent business innovation because they\ncould not claim a patent on their new methods.\n   \u201c[C]ompanies have ample incentives to develop business\nmethods even without patent protection, because the\ncompetitive marketplace rewards companies that use\nmore efficient business methods.\u201d Burk & Lemley 1618.49\nInnovators often capture advantages from new business\nmethods notwithstanding the risk of others copying their\ninnovation.

It gener\nally does not require the same \u201cenormous costs in terms of\ntime, research, and development,\u201d Bicron, 416 U.

Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.,\n548 U. S. 124, 126\u2013127 (2006) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom dismissal of certiorari). Patents \u201ccan discourage\nresearch by impeding the free exchange of information,\u201d\nfor example, by forcing people to \u201cavoid the use of poten\ntially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly\nand time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat\nents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by\nraising the costs of using the patented\u201d methods.

S.,\nat 154 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on\nbusiness methods may be especially high.\n   The primary concern is that patents on business meth\nods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition\nand innovation. As one scholar explains, \u201cit is useful to\nconceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are\non top; specific applications are at the bottom.\u201d Dreyfuss\n275. The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the\ngreater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to\nfurther innovation.53 Thus, this Court stated in Benson\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 53 See   Dreyfuss 276; Merges & Nelson, On the Complex Economics of\n44                       BILSKI v.

Busi\nness methods are similarly often closer to \u201cbig ideas,\u201d as\nthey are the basic tools of commercial work. They are\nalso, in many cases, the basic tools of further business\ninnovation: Innovation in business methods is often a\nsequential and complementary process in which imitation\nmay be a \u201cspur to innovation\u201d and patents may \u201cbecome an\nimpediment.\u201d Bessen & Maskin, Sequential Innovation,\nPatents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J.

Businesses would either live in constant\nfear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of\nsearching through patents that describe methods of doing\nbusiness, attempting to decide whether their innovation is\none that remains in the public domain.

Yet patents on methods of conducting\nbusiness generally are composed largely or entirely of\nintangible steps. Compared to \u201cthe kinds of goods . . .\naround which patent rules historically developed,\u201d it thus\ntends to be more costly and time consuming to search\nthrough, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business\nmethods. See Long 539, 470.56\n   The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in\nour society, and their potential vagueness also invite a\nparticularly pernicious use of patents that we have long\ncriticized.

The argument goes that\nbecause business methods are both vague and not confined to any one\nindustry, there is not a well-confined body of prior art to consult, and\ntherefore many \u201cbad\u201d patents are likely to issue, a problem that would\nneed to be sorted out in later litigation.

Even if a\nbusiness method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent\nholders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to\nbully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the\ncosts of a drawn out, fact-intensive patent litigation.57\nThat can take a particular toll on small and upstart busi\nnesses.58 Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to\ncompetition for the type of subject matter that is patented.\nBut patents on business methods are patents on business\nitself. Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of\npatents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the\ndynamism of the marketplace.59\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  57 See generally Farrell & Shapiro, How Strong Are Weak Patents?\n\n98 Amer.

And as I understand their\npractical consequences, it is hard to see how they would.\n                              VII\n  The Constitution grants to Congress an important\npower to promote innovation. In its exercise of that power,\nCongress has established an intricate system of intellec\ntual property. The scope of patentable subject matter\nunder that system is broad. But it is not endless. In the\nabsence of any clear guidance from Congress, we have only\nlimited textual, historical, and functional clues on which\nto rely. Those clues all point toward the same conclusion:\nthat petitioners\u2019 claim is not a \u201cprocess\u201d within the mean\ning of \u00a7101 because methods of doing business are not, in\nthemselves, covered by the statute. In my view, acknowl\nedging as much would be a far more sensible and re\nstrained way to resolve this case. Accordingly, while I\nconcur in the judgment, I strongly disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s disposition of this case.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. \u00a7101. Ante, at\n2 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). This Court has\nnever before held that so-called \u201cbusiness methods\u201d are\npatentable, and, in my view, the text, history, and pur\nposes of the Patent Act make clear that they are not.\nAnte, at 10\u201347. I would therefore decide this case on that\nground, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion in full.\n  I write separately, however, in order to highlight the\nsubstantial agreement among many Members of the Court\non many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by\nthis case. In light of the need for clarity and settled law in\nthis highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.\n                             II\n  In addition to the Court\u2019s unanimous agreement that\nthe claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it\nis my view that the following four points are consistent\n2                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwith both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019\nopinion concurring in the judgment:\n   First, although the text of \u00a7101 is broad, it is not with\nout limit. See ante, at 4\u20135 (opinion of the Court); ante, at\n10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). \u201c[T]he underly\ning policy of the patent system [is] that \u2018the things which\nare worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive\npatent,\u2019 . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the\nlimited patent monopoly.\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co. of\nKansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (1966) (quoting Letter\nfrom Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,\n1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing\nton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting\nthe Patent Act to \u201cdetermine not only what is protected,\nbut also what is free for all to use.\u201d Bonito Boats, Inc. v.\nThunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In\nparticular, the Court has long held that \u201c[p]henomena of\nnature, though just discovered, mental processes, and\nabstract intellectual concepts are not patentable\u201d under\n\u00a7101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda\nmental principles would \u201cwholly pre-empt\u201d the public\u2019s\naccess to the \u201cbasic tools of scientific and technological\nwork.\u201d Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);\nsee also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);\nDiamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).\n   Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a\ncentury, the Court has stated that \u201c[t]ransformation and\nreduction of an article to a different state or thing is the\nclue to the patentability of a process claim that does not\ninclude particular machines.\u201d Diehr, supra, at 184 (em\nphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,\ne.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,\n588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788\n(1877). Application of this test, the so-called \u201cmachine-or\ntransformation test,\u201d has thus repeatedly helped the Court\nto determine what is \u201ca patentable \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d Flook, supra,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 589.\n   Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has\nalways been a \u201cuseful and important clue,\u201d it has never\nbeen the \u201csole test\u201d for determining patentability. Ante, at\n8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that\n\u201cno process patent could ever qualify\u201d for protection under\n\u00a7101 \u201cif it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]\nrequirements\u201d). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a\nprocess claim meets the requirements of \u00a7101 when, \u201ccon\nsidered as a whole,\u201d it \u201cis performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or\nreducing an article to a different state or thing).\u201d Diehr,\nsupra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus\nan important example of how a court can determine pat\nentability under \u00a7101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this\ncase by treating it as the exclusive test.\n   Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is\nnot the only test for patentability, this by no means indi\ncates that anything which produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete,\nand tangible result,\u2019 \u201d State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.\nSignature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA\nFed. 1998), is patentable. \u201c[T]his Court has never made\nsuch a statement and, if taken literally, the statement\nwould cover instances where this Court has held the con\ntrary.\u201d Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo\nlite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted); see also, e.g., O\u2019Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 117\n(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of\nthe \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible result\u201d approach to\npatentability, associated with the Federal Circuit\u2019s State\nStreet decision, preceded the granting of patents that\n\u201cranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab\nsurd.\u201d In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)\n(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a\n4                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cmethod of training janitors to dust and vacuum using\nvideo displays,\u201d a \u201csystem for toilet reservations,\u201d and a\n\u201cmethod of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating\nstatus in order to limit \u2018the embarrassment of rejection\u2019 \u201d);\nsee also Brief for Respondent 40\u201341, and n. 20 (listing\ndubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in\ntoday\u2019s decision should be taken as disapproving of that\ndetermination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the\n\u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not necessarily the\nsole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de\nemphasize the test\u2019s usefulness nor to suggest that many\npatentable processes lie beyond its reach.\n                        III\n  With these observations, I concur in the Court\u2019s\njudgment.\n",

Argued November 9, 2009\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nPetitioners\u2019 patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention\n  that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy mar\n  ket can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key\n  claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how\n  to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a\n  simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how\n  claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consum\n  ers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\n  mand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds\n  that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely\n  manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical\n  problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and\n  affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court\n  rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention\n  was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101\u2014i.e.,\n  whether the invention produced a \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible re\n  sult,\u201d see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial\n  Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373\u2014holding instead that a claimed\n  process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or\n  apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different\n  state or thing. Concluding that this \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d\n  is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n  \u00a7101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not\n  patent eligible.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                          BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132, concluding that petitioners\u2019 claimed inven\n  tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4\u20138, 10\u201311, 12\u201316.\n     (a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions\n  or discoveries that are patent eligible: \u201cprocess[es],\u201d \u201cmachin[es],\u201d\n  \u201cmanufactur[es],\u201d and \u201ccomposition[s] of matter.\u201d \u201cIn choosing such\n  expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent\n  laws would be given wide scope,\u201d Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n  303, 308, in order to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuity should receive a liberal\n  encouragement,\u2019 \u201d id., at 308\u2013309. This Court\u2019s precedents provide\n  three specific exceptions to \u00a7101\u2019s broad principles: \u201claws of nature,\n  physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u201d Id., at 309. While not re\n  quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the\n  notion that a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d And, in\n  any case, the exceptions have defined the statute\u2019s reach as a matter\n  of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.\n  Tatham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87271\"><a href=\"/opinion/87271/le-roy-v-tatham/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174. The \u00a7101 eligibility inquiry is only a\n  threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the\n  four categories, it must also satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements\n  of this title,\u201d \u00a7101(a), including novelty, see \u00a7102, nonobviousness, see\n  \u00a7103, and a full and particular description, see \u00a7112. The invention\n  at issue is claimed to be a \u201cprocess,\u201d which \u00a7100(b) defines as a \u201cproc\n  ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma\n  chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d Pp. 4\u20135.\n     (b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat\n  ent eligibility under \u00a7101. The Court\u2019s precedents establish that al\n  though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative\n  tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat\n  ent-eligible \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. In holding to the contrary, the\n  Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:\n  Courts \u201c \u2018should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi\n  tions which the legislature has not expressed,\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Diehr,\n  450 U. S. 175, 182, and, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, \u2018words will be in\n  terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean\n  ing,\u2019 \u201d ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,\n  common meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that would require it to be tied to a\n  machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di\n  rector urges the Court to read \u00a7101\u2019s other three patentable catego\n  ries as confining \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or transformation. However,\n  the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for \u00a7100(b) al\n  ready explicitly defines \u201cprocess,\u201d see Burgess v. United States, 553\n  U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section\u2019s inclusion of those\n  other categories suggests that a \u201cprocess\u201d must be tied to one of them.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nFinally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has\nendorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.\nRecent authorities show that the test was never intended to be ex\nhaustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588,\nn. 9. Pp. 5\u20138.\n   (c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term \u201cprocess\u201d\nthat would categorically exclude business methods.            The term\n\u201cmethod\u201d within \u00a7100(b)\u2019s \u201cprocess\u201d definition, at least as a textual\nmatter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and\nthis Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing\nbusiness. The Court is unaware of any argument that the \u201cordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning,\u201d Diehr, supra, at 182, of \u201cmethod\u201d\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method\nexception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies\nfor conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion\nargument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explic\nitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method pat\nents: Under \u00a7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based\non \u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a defense\nof prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges\nthat there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clari\nfies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of\n\u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patent\ning under \u00a7101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon\nagainst interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would\nrender another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while \u00a7273 appears to leave open the pos\nsibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad\npatentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10\u201311.\n   (d) Even though petitioners\u2019 application is not categorically outside\nof \u00a7101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today,\nthat does not mean it is a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. Petitioners seek to\npatent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, how\never, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent ab\nstract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and\nreduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpat\nentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and\nFlook. Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging\ncan be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent\nthe use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well\nknown random analysis techniques to help establish some of the in\nputs into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12\u2013\n4                            BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    15.\n      (e) Because petitioners\u2019 patent application can be rejected under\n    the Court\u2019s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the\n    Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable \u201cproc\n    ess,\u201d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in\n    \u00a7100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n    Nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal\n    Circuit\u2019s past interpretations of \u00a7101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,\n    at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the\n    machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case\n    law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting\n    business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or\n    transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limiting criteria that further\n    the Patent Act\u2019s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.\n    P. 16.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts II\u2013\nB\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132.

The patent application claims a procedure for\ninstructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the\nrisk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ\nomy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition\nthat the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent\nlaw: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform\nan article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;\nand (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals\nruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma\nchine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used\nfor determining the patentability of a \u201cprocess\u201d under the\nPatent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SCALIA does not join Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132.\n2                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Petitioners\u2019 application seeks patent protection for a\nclaimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of\ncommodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,\nagainst the risk of price changes. The key claims are\nclaims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in\nstructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept\narticulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\nClaim 1 consists of the following steps:\n       \u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a\n    fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed\n    rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum\n    ers;\n       \u201c(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       \u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\nThe remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be\napplied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini\nmize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\nmand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims \u201c[t]he\nmethod of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and\nsaid market participants are transmission distributors.\u201d\nId., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar\nstatistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in\nclaim 4\u2019s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using\nwell-known random analysis techniques to determine how\nmuch a seller will gain \u201cfrom each transaction under each\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Students of patent law\nwould be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.\n   Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The\ncourt rejected its prior test for determining whether a\nclaimed invention was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101\u2014whether it produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete, and tangi\nble result\u2019 \u201d\u2014as articulated in State Street Bank & Trust\nCo. v.

See In re Bilski, 545\nF. 3d 943, 959\u2013960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).\nThe court held that \u201c[a] claimed process is surely patent\neligible under \u00a7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine\nor apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.\u201d Id., at 954. The court concluded\nthis \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d is \u201cthe sole test\ngoverning \u00a7101 analyses,\u201d id., at 955, and thus the \u201ctest\nfor determining patent eligibility of a process under \u00a7101,\u201d\nid., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,\nthe court held that petitioners\u2019 application was not patent\neligible. Id., at 963\u2013966.

Id., at 966\u2013976.\n  Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer\nargued that petitioners\u2019 application was \u201cnot eligible for\npatent protection because it is directed to a method of\nconducting business.\u201d Id., at 998. He urged the adoption\nof a \u201ctechnological standard for patentability.\u201d Id., at\n1010. Judge Rader would have found petitioners\u2019 claims\nwere an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only\nJudge Newman disagreed with the court\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioners\u2019 application was outside of the reach of \u00a7101.\nShe did not say that the application should have been\ngranted but only that the issue should be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to determine whether the application\nqualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 556 U.

While these exceptions are not re\nquired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the\nnotion that a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d\nAnd, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach\nof the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going\nback 150 years.

Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).\n   The \u00a7101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold\ntest. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive\nthe Patent Act\u2019s protection the claimed invention must\nalso satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d\n\u00a7101. Those requirements include that the invention be\nnovel, see \u00a7102, nonobvious, see \u00a7103, and fully and par\nticularly described, see \u00a7112.\n   The present case involves an invention that is claimed\nto be a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. Section 100(b) defines \u201cproc\ness\u201d as:\n    \u201cprocess, art or method, and includes a new use of a\n    known process, machine, manufacture, composition of\n    matter, or material.\u201d\nThe Court first considers two proposed categorical limita\ntions on \u201cprocess\u201d patents under \u00a7101 that would, if\nadopted, bar petitioners\u2019 application in the present case:\nthe machine-or-transformation test and the categorical\nexclusion of business method patents.\n6                     BILSKI v.

This Court\nhas \u201cmore than once cautioned that courts \u2018should not read\ninto the patent laws limitations and conditions which the\nlegislature has not expressed.\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450\nU. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;\nsome internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as\nin all statutory construction, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined,\n\u2018words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con\ntemporary, common meaning.\u2019 \u201d Diehr, supra, at 182\n(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).\nThe Court has read the \u00a7101 term \u201cmanufacture\u201d in accor\ndance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,\nat 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,\n283 U.

See Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 588\u2013589 (1978). This Court has not\nindicated that the existence of these well-established\nexceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose\nother limitations that are inconsistent with the text and\nthe statute\u2019s purpose and design. Concerns about at\ntempts to call any form of human activity a \u201cprocess\u201d can\nbe met by making sure the claim meets the requirements\nof \u00a7101.\n   Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntest for what constitutes a \u201cprocess\u201d (as opposed to just an\nimportant and useful clue) violates these statutory inter\npretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that \u201c[t]he\nterm \u2018process\u2019 means process, art or method, and includes\na new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.\u201d The Court is unaware\nof any \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d\nDiehr, supra, at 182, of the definitional terms \u201cprocess, art\nor method\u201d that would require these terms to be tied to a\nmachine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the\nCourt to look to the other patentable categories in \u00a7101\u2014\nmachines, manufactures, and compositions of matter\u2014to\nconfine the meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or trans\nformation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under\nthis canon, \u201can ambiguous term may be given more precise\ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associ\nated.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncanon is inapplicable here, for \u00a7100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term \u201cprocess.\u201d See Burgess v. United States,\n553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (\u201cWhen a statute includes an\nexplicit definition, we must follow that definition\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this\nCourt has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as\nthe exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener, 94\nU. S. 780, 788 (1877), explained that a \u201cprocess\u201d is \u201can act,\nor a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be\ntransformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\u201d\nMore recent cases, however, have rejected the broad impli\ncations of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority\nshows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or\nexclusive test. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 70\n(1972), noted that \u201c[t]ransformation and reduction of an\narticle \u2018to a different state or thing\u2019 is the clue to the pat\n8                     BILSKI v.

Flook took a similar approach, \u201cassum[ing] that a\nvalid process patent may issue even if it does not meet\n[the machine-or-transformation test].\u201d 437 U. S., at 588,\nn. 9.\n  This Court\u2019s precedents establish that the machine-or\ntransformation test is a useful and important clue, an\ninvestigative tool, for determining whether some claimed\ninventions are processes under \u00a7101. The machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for deciding\nwhether an invention is a patent-eligible \u201cprocess.\u201d\n                               2\n  It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy\nthe machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in\nearlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained\nby Judge Dyk\u2019s thoughtful historical review. See 545\nF. 3d, at 966\u2013976 (concurring opinion). But times change.\nTechnology and other innovations progress in unexpected\nways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that\nuntil recent times, \u201cwell-established principles of patent\nlaw probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid\npatent on almost any conceivable computer program.\u201d\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 195 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But\nthis fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such\nas computer programs are always unpatentable. See id.,\nat 192\u2013193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for\nmolding rubber that included a computer program is\nwithin patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a \u201cdy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions.\u201d J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 135 (2001).

S., at 315.\n   The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a\nsufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in\nthe Industrial Age\u2014for example, inventions grounded in a\nphysical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to\ndoubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for\ndetermining the patentability of inventions in the Infor\nmation Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the ma\nchine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as\nto the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medi\ncine techniques, and inventions based on linear program\nming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital\nsignals. See, e.g., Brief for Business Software Alliance 24\u2013\n25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al.\n14\u201327; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8\u201315;\nBrief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association\n17\u201322; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9\u201310.\n   In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation\ntest to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions\nof such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring\nthe larger object of securing patents for valuable inven\ntions without transgressing the public domain. The dis\nsent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.\n545 F. 3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previ\nously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable \u201cproc\ness[es],\u201d it may not make sense to require courts to confine\nthemselves to asking the questions posed by the machine\nor-transformation test. Section 101\u2019s terms suggest that\nnew technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson,\nsupra, at 71 (to \u201cfreeze process patents to old technologies,\nleaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing\ntechnology[,] . . . is not our purpose\u201d).\n   It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not\ncommenting on the patentability of any particular inven\n10                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned\ntechnologies from the Information Age should or should\nnot receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil\nity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises\nnew difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people\ntrying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for\ntheir inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in\nstriking the balance between protecting inventors and not\ngranting monopolies over procedures that others would\ndiscover by independent, creative application of general\nprinciples. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take\na position on where that balance ought to be struck.\n                               C\n                               1\n   Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention\nthat the term \u201cprocess\u201d categorically excludes business\nmethods. The term \u201cmethod,\u201d which is within \u00a7100(b)\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cprocess,\u201d at least as a textual matter and\nbefore consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and\nthis Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some meth\nods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining \u201cmethod\u201d as\n\u201c[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or\nmanner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure\nadopted in investigation or instruction\u201d). The Court is\nunaware of any argument that the \u201c \u2018ordinary, contempo\nrary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d Diehr, supra, at 182, of \u201cmethod\u201d\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro\nhibition on business method patents would reach, and\nwhether it would exclude technologies for conducting a\nbusiness more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and\nFinancial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56\nScottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (\u201cThere is no precise\ndefinition of . . . business method patents\u201d).\n   The argument that business methods are categorically\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Under 35 U. S. C.\n\u00a7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on\n\u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a\ndefense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,\n\u201cmethod\u201d is defined as \u201ca method of doing or conducting\nbusiness.\u201d \u00a7273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this\ndefense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be\nbusiness method patents. Section 273\u2019s definition of\n\u201cmethod,\u201d to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a\nprior-enacted statute. But what \u00a7273 does is clarify the\nunderstanding that a business method is simply one kind\nof \u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible\nfor patenting under \u00a7101.\n   A conclusion that business methods are not patentable\nin any circumstances would render \u00a7273 meaningless.\nThis would violate the canon against interpreting any\nstatutory provision in a manner that would render an\nother provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of\ncourse, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the\nU. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at\ndifferent times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus\ntrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529\u2013530 (1939) (opinion\nof Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta\ntion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the\nsubjective intent of various legislators in enacting the\nsubsequent provision. Finally, while \u00a7273 appears to\nleave open the possibility of some business method pat\nents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such\nclaimed inventions.\n                            2\n  Interpreting \u00a7101 to exclude all business methods sim\nply because business method patents were rarely issued\n12                   BILSKI v.

The Information Age empow\ners people with new capacities to perform statistical\nanalyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and\nsophistication that enable the design of protocols for more\nefficient performance of a vast number of business tasks.\nIf a high enough bar is not set when considering patent\napplications of this sort, patent examiners and courts\ncould be flooded with claims that would put a chill on\ncreative endeavor and dynamic change.\n   In searching for a limiting principle, this Court\u2019s prece\ndents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide\nuseful tools. See infra, at 12\u201315. Indeed, if the Court of\nAppeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category\nor class of patent applications that claim to instruct how\nbusiness should be conducted, and then rule that the\ncategory is unpatentable because, for instance, it repre\nsents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion\nmight well be in accord with controlling precedent. See\nibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent\nwith the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the\npossibility that there are at least some processes that can\nbe fairly described as business methods that are within\npatentable subject matter under \u00a7101.\n   Finally, even if a particular business method fits into\nthe statutory definition of a \u201cprocess,\u201d that does not mean\nthat the application claiming that method should be\ngranted.     In order to receive patent protection, any\nclaimed invention must be novel, \u00a7102, nonobvious, \u00a7103,\nand fully and particularly described, \u00a7112. These limita\ntions serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Petitioners seek to patent both\nthe concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. App. 19\u201320. Rather than\nadopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging\nand unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case\nnarrowly on the basis of this Court\u2019s decisions in Benson,\nFlook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners\u2019 claims are\nnot patentable processes because they are attempts to\npatent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court\nagree that the patent application at issue here falls out\nside of \u00a7101 because it claims an abstract idea.\n    In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli\ncation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal\nnumerals into pure binary code was a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101. 409 U. S., at 64\u201367. The Court first explained that\n\u201c \u2018[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an\noriginal cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no\none can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held\nthe application at issue was not a \u201cprocess,\u201d but an unpat\nentable abstract idea. \u201cIt is conceded that one may not\npatent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the\nresult if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure\nbinary numerals were patented in this case.\u201d 409 U. S., at\n71. A contrary holding \u201cwould wholly pre-empt the\nmathematical formula and in practical effect would be a\npatent on the algorithm itself.\u201d Id., at 72.\n    In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after\n14                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBenson. The applicant there attempted to patent a proce\ndure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic\nconversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. The application\u2019s only innovation was reliance\non a mathematical algorithm. 437 U. S., at 585\u2013586.\nFlook held the invention was not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d\nThe Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the\nalgorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still\nbe freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. 437 U. S., at 589\u2013590. Nevertheless, Flook\nrejected \u201c[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter\nhow conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an\nunpatentable principle into a patentable process.\u201d Id., at\n590. The Court concluded that the process at issue there\nwas \u201cunpatentable under \u00a7101, not because it contain[ed]\na mathematical algorithm as one component, but because\nonce that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior\nart, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no\npatentable invention.\u201d Id., at 594. As the Court later\nexplained, Flook stands for the proposition that the prohi\nbition against patenting abstract ideas \u201ccannot be circum\nvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a\nparticular technological environment\u201d or adding \u201cinsignifi\ncant postsolution activity.\u201d Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191\u2013192.\n  Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on\nthe principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The appli\ncation in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for\n\u201cmolding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured preci\nsion products,\u201d using a mathematical formula to complete\nsome of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U. S.,\nat 177. Diehr explained that while an abstract idea, law of\nnature, or mathematical formula could not be patented,\n\u201can application of a law of nature or mathematical for\nmula to a known structure or process may well be deserv\ning of patent protection.\u201d Id., at 187. Diehr emphasized\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than\n\u201cdissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and\nthen . . . ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the\nanalysis.\u201d Id., at 188. Finally, the Court concluded that\nbecause the claim was not \u201can attempt to patent a\nmathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial\nprocess for the molding of rubber products,\u201d it fell within\n\u00a7101\u2019s patentable subject matter. Id., at 192\u2013193.\n   In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners\u2019\napplication is not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d Claims 1 and 4\nin petitioners\u2019 application explain the basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk: \u201cHedging is a funda\nmental economic practice long prevalent in our system of\ncommerce and taught in any introductory finance class.\u201d\n545 F. 3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g., D.\nChorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instru\nments 75\u201394 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &\nJ. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Con\ncepts, Methods, and Uses 581\u2013582 (13th ed. 2010); S.\nRoss, R. Westerfield, & B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Cor\nporate Finance 743\u2013744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of\nhedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathemati\ncal formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,\njust like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\nAllowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre\nempt use of this approach in all fields, and would effec\ntively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.\n   Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims are broad examples of how\nhedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.\nFlook established that limiting an abstract idea to one\nfield of use or adding token postsolution components did\nnot make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the\nremaining claims in petitioners\u2019 application do. These\nclaims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of\nhedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the\n16                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of well-known random analysis techniques to help\nestablish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,\nthese claims add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook\ninvention was at least directed to the narrower domain of\nsignaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.\n                         *    *    *\n   Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita\ntions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act\u2019s\ntext. The patent application here can be rejected under\nour precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.\nThe Court, therefore, need not define further what consti\ntutes a patentable \u201cprocess,\u201d beyond pointing to the defini\ntion of that term provided in \u00a7100(b) and looking to the\nguideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n   And nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be read as endors\ning interpretations of \u00a7101 that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.\nIt may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to\nmake the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre\ncisely because its case law had not adequately identified\nless extreme means of restricting business method pat\nents, including (but not limited to) application of our\nopinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an\nexclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means\nforeclose the Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limit\ning criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act\nand are not inconsistent with its text.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The only question presented\nin this case is whether the so-called machine-or\ntransformation test is the exclusive test for what consti\ntutes a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. It\nwould be possible to answer that question simply by hold\ning, as the entire Court agrees, that although the ma\nchine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is\nnot the exclusive test.\n   I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty\nthat currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide\nfurther guidance. But I would take a different approach.\nRather than making any broad statements about how to\ndefine the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 or tinkering with the\nbounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I\nwould restore patent law to its historical and constitu\ntional moorings.\n   For centuries, it was considered well established that a\nseries of steps for conducting business was not, in itself,\n2                         BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npatentable. In the late 1990\u2019s, the Federal Circuit and\nothers called this proposition into question. Congress\nquickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a\nstopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant\nnew problem for the business community. It passed the\nFirst Inventors Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat.\n1501A\u2013555 (codified at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7273), which provides a\nlimited defense to claims of patent infringement, see\n\u00a7273(b), for \u201cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\u201d\n\u00a7273(a)(3). Following several more years of confusion, the\nFederal Circuit changed course, overruling recent deci\nsions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a\npatentable process only if it is tied to a machine or trans\nforms an article into a different state or thing. This \u201cma\nchine-or-transformation test\u201d excluded general methods of\ndoing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other\nsubjects that could be called processes.\n  The Court correctly holds that the machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes\na patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.1 But the\nCourt is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any\nseries of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of\nnature may constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7101. The language in the Court\u2019s opinion to this effect\ncan only cause mischief. The wiser course would have\nbeen to hold that petitioners\u2019 method is not a \u201cprocess\u201d\nbecause it describes only a general method of engaging in\nbusiness transactions\u2014and business methods are not\npatentable.     More precisely, although a process is not\npatent-ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting\nbusiness, a claim that merely describes a method of doing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even if the machine-or-transformation test may not define the scope\n\nof a patentable process, it would be a grave mistake to assume that\nanything with a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d State Street\nBank & Trust v.

The general method, described in Claim 1, entails\n\u201cmanaging the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold\nby a commodity provider at a fixed price,\u201d and consists of\nthe following steps:\n       \u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at\n    a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said\n    fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said\n    consumers;\n       \u201c(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       \u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\n   Although the patent application makes clear that the\n\u201cmethod can be used for any commodity to manage con\nsumption risk in a fixed bill price product,\u201d id., at 11, it\nincludes specific applications of the method, particularly\nin the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and\nconsumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctua\ntions in demand during specified time periods.

See id., at 12\u201319.\n   The patent examiner rejected petitioners\u2019 application on\nthe ground that it \u201cis not directed to the technological\narts,\u201d insofar as it \u201cis not implemented on a specific appa\nratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and\nsolves a purely mathematical problem without any limita\ntion to a practical application.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.\n   The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board)\naffirmed the examiner\u2019s decision, but it rejected the posi\ntion that a patentable process must relate to \u201ctechnologi\ncal arts\u201d or be performed on a machine. Id., at 180a\u2013181a.\nInstead, the Board denied petitioners\u2019 patent on two alter\nnative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent\ninvolves only mental steps that do not transform physical\nsubject matter, id., at 181a\u2013184a; and, second, that it is\ndirected to an \u201cabstract idea,\u201d id., at 184a\u2013187a.\n   Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit.

Relying on several of our\ncases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim\non a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d from a claim on a \u201cprocess,\u201d\nthe court concluded that a \u201cclaimed process is surely pat\nent-eligible under \u00a7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular\nmachine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular\narticle into a different state or thing.\u201d Id., at 954\u2013955.\nThe court further concluded that this \u201cmachine-or\ntransformation test\u201d is \u201cthe sole test governing \u00a7101\nanalyses,\u201d id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the\n\u201ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under\n\u00a7101,\u201d id., at 956.

See, e.g., ante, at 6 (terms in \u00a7101 must be\nviewed in light of their \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning\u2019 \u201d); ante, at 10 (patentable \u201cmethod\u201d is any \u201cor\nderly procedure or process,\u201d \u201cregular way or manner of\ndoing anything,\u201d or \u201cset form of procedure adopted in\ninvestigation or instruction\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III,\ninfra, if this portion of the Court\u2019s opinion were taken\nliterally, the results would be absurd: Anything that con\nstitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it\nis novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity. But\nthe opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The\nCourt makes this clear when it accepts that the \u201catextual\u201d\nmachine-or-transformation test, ante, at 12, is \u201cuseful and\nimportant,\u201d ante, at 8, even though it \u201cviolates\u201d the stated\n\u201cstatutory interpretation principles,\u201d ante, at 6; and when\nthe Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt com\nmonly used ideas, see ante, at 14\u201315.\n   Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue\npresented to us, the opinion uses some language that\nseems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentabil\nity. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests\nthat these criteria may operate differently when address\ning technologies of a recent vintage. See ante, at 8\u20139\n(machine-or-transformation test is useful \u201cfor evaluating\nprocesses similar to those in the Industrial Age,\u201d but is\nless useful \u201cfor determining the patentability of inventions\nin the Information Age\u201d). In moments of caution, however,\nthe opinion for the Court explains\u2014correctly\u2014that the\nCourt is merely restoring the law to its historical state of\nrest. See ante, at 8 (\u201cThis Court\u2019s precedents establish\nthat the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and\n8                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nimportant clue, an investigative tool, for determining\nwhether some claimed inventions are processes under\n\u00a7101 \u201d). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I under\nstand the Court\u2019s opinion to hold only that the machine-or\ntransformation test remains an important test for pat\nentability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be\nevaluated using these criteria.\n   Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the\nquestions presented\u2014whether the particular series of\nsteps in petitioners\u2019 application is an abstract idea\u2014the\nCourt uses language that could suggest a shift in our\napproach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that\npetitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does\nnot show how this conclusion follows \u201cclear[ly],\u201d ante, at\n15, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for\n\u201c[a] principle, in the abstract,\u201d or a \u201cfundamental truth.\u201d\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 589 (1978) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phe\nnomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by\nthe mathematical formula at issue in Gottschalk v. Ben\nson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972), and in Flook.\n   The Court construes petitioners\u2019 claims on processes for\npricing as claims on \u201cthe basic concept of hedging, or\nprotecting against risk,\u201d ante, at 14, and thus discounts\nthe application\u2019s discussion of what sorts of data to use,\nand how to analyze those data, as mere \u201ctoken postsolu\ntion components,\u201d ante, at 15. In other words, the Court\nartificially limits petitioners\u2019 claims to hedging, and then\nconcludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a\nterm that describes a category of processes including\npetitioners\u2019 claims. Why the Court does this is never\nmade clear. One might think that the Court\u2019s analysis\nmeans that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is\nitself an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never\nsuggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of\npatentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat petitioners\u2019 application is phrased broadly. See ante,\nat 14\u201315. But claim specification is covered by \u00a7112, not\n\u00a7101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable\nidea merely because it was described without sufficient\nspecificity, the Court could be calling into question some of\nour own prior decisions.2 At points, the opinion suggests\nthat novelty is the clue. See ante, at 14. But the fact that\nhedging is \u201c \u2018long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d\nibid., cannot justify the Court\u2019s conclusion, as \u201cthe proper\nconstruction of \u00a7101 . . . does not involve the familiar\nissu[e] of novelty\u201d that arises under \u00a7102. Flook, 437\nU. S., at 588. At other points, the opinion for a plurality\nsuggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent\ninvolved. See, e.g., ante, at 12 (courts should use the\nabstract-idea rule as a \u201ctoo[l]\u201d to set \u201ca high enough bar\u201d\n\u201cwhen considering patent applications of this sort\u201d). But\nwe have never in the past suggested that the inquiry\nvaries by subject matter.\n  The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account\nof what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. In\ndeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially\nasserts its conclusion that petitioners\u2019 application claims\nan abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof)\nmay have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it\nalso means that the Court\u2019s musings on this issue stand\nfor very little.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For example, a rule that broadly-phrased claims cannot constitute\npatentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander\nGraham Bell\u2019s famous fifth claim on \u201c \u2018[t]he method of, and apparatus\nfor, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein\ndescribed, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the\nvibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds,\nsubstantially as set forth,\u2019 \u201d The Telephone Cases, 126 U. S. 1, 531\n(1888).\n10                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment \n\n\n                             III \n\n   I agree with the Court that the text of \u00a7101 must be the\nstarting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however,\nthe text must not be the end point as well.\n   Pursuant to its power \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of . . .\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors\nthe exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,\u201d U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent\nlaws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain in\nventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging inno\nvation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952\n(1952 Act), Congress has provided that \u201c[w]hoever invents\nor discovers any new and useful process, machine, manu\nfacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful\nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, sub\nject to the conditions and requirements of this title,\u201d 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7101, which include that the patent also be novel,\n\u00a7102, and nonobvious, \u00a7103. The statute thus authorizes\nfour categories of subject matter that may be patented:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. \u201c[N]o\npatent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel,\nand nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express\ncategories of patentable subject matter.\u201d Kewanee Oil Co.\nv. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 483 (1974).\n   Section 101 undoubtedly defines in \u201cexpansive terms\u201d\nthe subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the\nstatute was meant to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuit[ies] receive a\nliberal encouragement.\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447\nU. S. 303, 308\u2013309 (1980); see also J. E. M. Ag Supply,\nInc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 130\n(2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery\nmay be patented. Certain things are \u201cfree for all to use.\u201d\nBonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

But, this definition is not especially help\nful, given that it also uses the term \u201cprocess\u201d and is there\nfore somewhat circular.\n   As lay speakers use the word \u201cprocess,\u201d it constitutes\nany series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as\nused in \u00a7101, the term does not refer to a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the\nordinary sense of the word,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 588; see\nalso Corning v. Burden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86831\"><a href=\"/opinion/86831/corning-v-burden/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (1854) (\u201c[T]he\nterm process is often used in a more vague sense, in which\nit cannot be the subject of a patent\u201d). Rather, as discussed\nin some detail in Part IV, infra, the term \u201cprocess\u201d (along\nwith the definitions given to that term) has long accumu\nlated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term\nwas used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended\nnor understood to encompass any series of steps or any\nway to do any thing.\n   With that understanding in mind, the Government has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court quotes our decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n303 (1980), for the proposition that, \u201c \u2018[i]n choosing such expansive\nterms . . . modified by the comprehensive \u201cany,\u201d Congress plainly\ncontemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 4. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in\nChakrabarty: the terms \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201ccomposition of matter.\u201d\nSee 447 U. S., at 308 (\u201cIn choosing such expansive terms as \u2018manufac\nture\u2019 and \u2018composition of matter,\u2019 modified by the comprehensive \u2018any,\u2019\nCongress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given\nwide scope\u201d). As discussed herein, Congress\u2019 choice of the term \u201cproc\ness\u201d reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of\nsteps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to\ncodify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the\ncase with the terms at issue in Chakrabarty.\n12                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued that because \u201ca word\u201d in a statute \u201cis given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it\u201d\nassociates, United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294\n(2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that \u201c[t]he\nother three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject\nmatter identified in Section 101\u2014\u2018machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter\u2019\u2014all \u2018are things made by man,\nand involve technology.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 26. Spe\ncifically, the Government submits, we may infer \u201cthat the\nterm \u2018process\u2019 is limited to technological and industrial\nmethods.\u201d Ibid. The Court rejects this submission cate\ngorically, on the ground that \u201c\u00a7100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6. But \u00a7100(b) de\nfines the term \u201cprocess\u201d by using the term \u201cprocess,\u201d as\nwell as several other general terms. This is not a case,\nthen, in which we must either \u201cfollow\u201d a definition, ante, at\n7, or rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of\nan ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very\nambiguous term that we must define.\n   In my view, the answer lies in between the Govern\nment\u2019s and the Court\u2019s positions: The terms adjacent to\n\u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 provide a clue as to its meaning, al\nthough not a very strong clue. Section 101\u2019s list of catego\nries of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunc\ntive, suggesting that the term \u201cprocess\u201d has content\ndistinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore\nbe illogical to \u201crob\u201d the word \u201cprocess\u201d of all independent\nmeaning. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338\n(1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences\nabout what is a \u201cprocess\u201d from common attributes in \u00a7101,\nit is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a per\nceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts\nat work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely con\nfirming our preconceived notions of what should be pat\nentable or of seeing common attributes that track \u201cthe\nfamiliar issues of novelty and obviousness\u201d that arise\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunder other sections of the statute but are not relevant to\n\u00a7101, Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. The placement of \u201cprocess\u201d\nnext to other items thus cannot prove that the term is\nlimited to any particular categories; it does, however, give\nreason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable \u201cproc\ness\u201d extends to cover any series of steps at all.\n   The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As\nbriefly discussed in Part II, supra, the Court at points\nappears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term\n\u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 is not a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the ordinary sense\nof the word,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. Instead, the Court\nposits that the word \u201cprocess\u201d must be understood in light\nof its \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d ante, at\n6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a\nfine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a\ndeeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex\nterms of art developed against a particular historical\nbackground.4 Indeed, the approach would render \u00a7101\nalmost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of\ndance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe\neven words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of\ntyping letters or uttering sounds\u2014all would be patent\neligible. I am confident that the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7101 is\nnot nearly so capacious.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act accord\n\ning to the Act\u2019s plain text, it could prohibit \u201cthe entire body of private\ncontract,\u201d National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435\nU. S. 679, 688 (1978).\n  5 The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that\n\nthese \u201c[c]oncerns\u201d \u201ccan be met by making sure that the claim meets the\nrequirements of \u00a7101.\u201d Ante, at 6. Because the only limitation on the\nplain meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the\nbar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this\nlimitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity\nand patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for\nabsurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of\nnovelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.\n14                       BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredi\nble about the Court\u2019s stated method of interpreting \u00a7101\n(other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible\nunder the Court\u2019s theory of \u00a7101) is that the Court devi\nates from its own professed commitment to \u201cordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning.\u201d As noted earlier, the\nCourt accepts a role for the \u201catextual\u201d machine-or\ntransformation \u201cclue.\u201d Ante, at 12, 7. The Court also\naccepts that we have \u201cforeclose[d] a purely literal reading\nof \u00a7101,\u201d Flook, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims\nthat are close to \u201claws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas,\u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185\n(1981), do not count as \u201cprocesses\u201d under \u00a7101, even if\nthey can be colloquially described as such.6 The Court\nattempts to justify this latter exception to \u00a7101 as \u201ca\nmatter of statutory stare decisis.\u201d Ante, at 5. But it is\nstrange to think that the very same term must be inter\npreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its his\ntorical usage on others.\n  In fact, the Court\u2019s understanding of \u00a7101 is even more\nremarkable because its willingness to exclude general\nprinciples from the provision\u2019s reach is in tension with its\napparent willingness to include steps for conducting busi\nness. The history of patent law contains strong norms\nagainst patenting these two categories of subject matter.\nBoth norms were presumably incorporated by Congress\ninto the Patent Act in 1952.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCf. ante, at 12\u201313 (plurality opinion). A great deal of human activity\nwas at some time novel and nonobvious.\n   6 Curiously, the Court concedes that \u201cthese exceptions are not re\n\nquired by the statutory text,\u201d but urges that \u201cthey are consistent with\nthe notion that a patentable process must be \u2018new and useful.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 5 (emphasis added). I do not see how these exceptions find a textual\nhome in the term \u201cnew and useful.\u201d The exceptions may be consistent\nwith those words, but they are sometimes inconsistent with the \u201cordi\nnary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d ante, at 6, 10 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), of the words \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201cmethod.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

As I read the history, it\nstrongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing\nbusiness is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101.\n  I am, of course, mindful of the fact that \u00a7101 \u201cis a dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions,\u201d and that one must therefore view his\ntorical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an\nappropriately high level of generality. J. E. M. Ag Supply,\n534 U. S., at 135; see also Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 315\u2013\n316. But it is nonetheless significant that while people\nhave long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing\nbusiness fall outside of the subject matter that has \u201chis\ntorically been eligible to receive the protection of our\npatent laws,\u201d Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond\nwhat the modern patent \u201cstatute was enacted to protect,\u201d\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 593. It is also significant that when\nCongress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against\nthe background of a well-settled understanding that a\nseries of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.\nThese considerations ought to guide our analysis.

Three years later, Congress\npassed the Patent Act of 1793 and slightly modified the\nlanguage to cover \u201cany new and useful art, machine,\nmanufacture or composition of matter, or any new and\nuseful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or\ncomposition of matter.\u201d 1 Stat. 319.\n   The object of the constitutional patent power and the\nstatutory authorization for process patents in the early\npatent Acts was the term \u201cuseful art.\u201d It is not evident\nfrom the face of the statutes or the Constitution whether\nthe objects of the patent system were \u201carts\u201d that are also\nuseful, or rather a more specific category, the class of arts\nknown as \u201cuseful arts.\u201d Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 12\n(describing the \u201c \u2018new and useful\u2019 tests which have always\nexisted in the statutory scheme\u201d and apply to all catego\nries of subject matter). However, we have generally as\nsumed that \u201cuseful art,\u201d at least as it is used in the Patent\nAct, is itself a term of art. See Burden, 15 How., at 267\u2013\n268.\n   The word \u201cart\u201d and the phrase \u201cuseful arts\u201d are subject\nto many meanings. There is room on the margins to de\nbate exactly what qualifies as either. There is room,\nmoreover, to debate at what level of generality we should\nunderstand these broad and historical terms, given that\n\u201c[a] rule that unanticipated inventions are without protec\ntion would conflict with the core concept of the patent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nD.

It appears, however,\nthat regardless of how one construes the term \u201cuseful\narts,\u201d business methods are not included.\n   Noah Webster\u2019s first American dictionary26 defined the\nterm \u201cart\u201d as the \u201cdisposition or modification of things by\nhuman skill, to answer the purpose intended,\u201d and differ\nentiated between \u201cuseful or mechanic\u201d arts, on the one\nhand, and \u201cliberal or polite\u201d arts, on the other. 1 An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828)\n(facsimile edition) (emphasis added). Although other\ndictionaries defined the word \u201cart\u201d more broadly,27 Web\nster\u2019s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the\nmeaning of the word \u201cmanufactures\u201d in the earlier English\nstatute. And we know that the term \u201cuseful arts\u201d was\nused in the founding era to refer to manufacturing and\nsimilar applied trades.28 See Coulter, The Field of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   26 Some scholars suggest that Webster\u2019s \u201cclose proximity to the Con\n\nstitutional Convention coupled with his familiarity with the delegates\nmakes it likely that he played some indirect role in the development\u201d of\nthe Constitution\u2019s Intellectual Property Clause\u2014a Clause that estab\nlished not only the power to create patents but also copyrights, a\nsubject in which Webster had great interest.

Everyone\nknew that manufactures and machines were at the core of\nthe patent system.\u201d Merges, Property Rights for Business\nConcepts and Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech.\nL. J. 577, 585 (1999) (hereinafter Merges). Thus, although\ncertain processes, such as those related to the technology\nof the time, might have been considered patentable, it is\npossible that \u201c[a]gainst this background, it would have\nbeen seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent\u201d\non methods of conducting business. Ibid.\nDevelopment of American Patent Law\n   During the first years of the patent system, no patents\nwere issued on methods of doing business.30 Indeed, for\nsome time, there were serious doubts as to \u201cthe patentabil\nity of processes per se,\u201d as distinct from the physical end\nproduct or the tools used to perform a process. Id., at 581\u2013\n582.31\n   Thomas Jefferson was the \u201c \u2018first administrator of our\npatent system\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe author of the 1793 Patent Act.\u201d\nGraham, 383 U. S., at 7. We have said that his \u201cconclu\nsions as to conditions of patentability . . . are worthy of\nnote.\u201d Ibid. at 7. During his time administering the sys\ntem, Jefferson \u201csaw clearly the difficulty\u201d of deciding what\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 See Walterscheid, To Promote the Progress 173\u2013178; Pollack 107\u2013\n\n108.\n   31 These doubts ended by the time of Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780\n\n(1877), in which we held that \u201ca process may be patentable irrespective\nof the particular form of the instrumentalities used,\u201d and therefore one\nmay patent \u201can act, or series of acts, performed upon the subject matter\nto be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\u201d Id., at 788.\n26                      BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshould be patentable.32 Id., at 9. He drafted the 1793 Act,\nid., at 7, and, years later, explained that in that Act \u201c \u2018the\nwhole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into\na system, under which every one might know when his\nactions were safe and lawful,\u2019 \u201d id., at 10 (quoting Letter to\nIssac McPherson, in VI Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181\u2013\n182 (H. Washington ed. 1861)). As the Court has ex\nplained, \u201cCongress agreed with Jefferson . . . that the\ncourts should develop additional conditions for patentabil\nity.\u201d Graham, 383 U. S., at 10. Thus \u201c[a]lthough the\nPatent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50\ntimes between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear\u201d of\nadding statutory requirements of patentability. Ibid. For\nnearly 160 years, Congress retained the term \u201cuseful arts,\u201d\nsee, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving\n\u201cwide latitude for judicial construction . . . to keep pace\nwith industrial development,\u201d Berman, Method Claims, 17\nJ. Pat. Off. Soc. 713, 714 (1935) (hereinafter Berman).\n   Although courts occasionally struggled with defining\nwhat was a patentable \u201cart\u201d during those 160 years, they\nconsistently rejected patents on methods of doing busi\nness. The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied.\nBut there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta:\nBusiness methods are not patentable arts. See, e.g.,\nUnited States Credit Sys. Co. v.

The 1952 Act likely captured that same mean\ning.38 Cf. Graham, 383 U.

But State\nStreet dealt with whether a piece of software could be patented and\naddressed only claims directed at machines, not processes. His opinion\nmay therefore be better understood merely as holding that an otherwise\npatentable process is not unpatentable simply because it is directed\ntoward the conduct of doing business\u2014an issue the Court has no\noccasion to address today. See State Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1375.\n32                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat piece of legislative history to mean that any series of\nsteps is a patentable process. Indeed, if that were so, then\nour many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process\nwere simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to\naccept that errant piece of legislative history as widening\nthe scope of the patent law would contradict other evi\ndence in the congressional record, as well as our presump\ntion that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of\n\u201cprocess\u201d and did not expand it, see Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n184.\n   Taken in context, it is apparent that the quoted lan\nguage has a far less expansive meaning. The full sentence\nin the Committee Reports reads: \u201cA person may have\n\u2018invented\u2019 a machine or a manufacture, which may include\nanything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi\ntions of [this] title are fulfilled.\u201d S. Rep. 1979, at 5; H. R.\nRep. 1923, at 6. Viewed as a whole, it seems clear that\nthis language does not purport to explain that \u201canything\nunder the sun\u201d is patentable. Indeed, the language may\nbe understood to state the exact opposite: that \u201c[a] person\nmay have \u2018invented\u2019 . . . anything under the sun,\u201d but that\nthing \u201cis not necessarily patentable under section 101.\u201d\nThus, even in the Chakrabarty opinion, which relied on\nthis quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not\n\u201csuggest that \u00a7101 has no limits or that it embraces every\ndiscovery.\u201d 447 U. S., at 309.\n   Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Re\nports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of\n\u00a7101, it did not purport to define the term \u201cprocess.\u201d The\nlanguage refers only to \u201cmanufacture[s]\u201d and \u201cmachine[s],\u201d\ntangible objects \u201cmade by man.\u201d It does not reference the\n\u201cprocess\u201d category of subject matter (nor could a process be\ncomfortably described as something \u201cmade by man\u201d). The\nlanguage may also be understood merely as defining the\nterm \u201cinvents\u201d in \u00a7101. As Judge Dyk explained in his\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Boulton, 8 T. R.\n95, 98 (K. B. 1799)).\n    The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expand\ning the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting\nthat any series of steps may be patented as a \u201cprocess\u201d\nunder \u00a7101. If anything, the Act appears to have codified\nthe conclusion that subject matter which was understood\nnot to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.\n    Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of\nsteps for conducting business is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under\n\u00a7101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never\nruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business\nmethods. But we have cast significant doubt on that\nproposition by giving substantial weight to the machine\nor-transformation test, as general methods of doing busi\nness do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of\nthis Court have noted that patents on business methods\nare of \u201csuspect validity.\u201d eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L.\nC., 547 U.

Although it may be difficult to define with\nprecision what is a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101, the\nhistorical clues converge on one conclusion: A business\nmethod is not a \u201cprocess.\u201d And to the extent that there is\nambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. \u201c[W]e\n34                    BILSKI v.

Brief for\nPetitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of\nstatutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the\n1999 Act.\n   In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti\nmated business methods could be patented, see State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit\nthe potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi\nfied at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7273, which provides a limited defense\nto claims of patent infringement, see \u00a7273(b), regarding\ncertain \u201cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\u201d\n\u00a7273(a)(3).\n   It is apparent, both from the content and history of the\nAct, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street\n(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading\nof State Street). The Act merely limited one potential\neffect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find\nthemselves liable for innocently using methods they as\nsumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to\namend the limitations in \u00a7101 on eligible subject matter.\nIndeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,\nwhich addresses \u201cPatents and Protection of Patent\nRights,\u201d rather than in Part II, which contains \u00a7101 and\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 184, we should be loath to conclude\nthat Congress effectively amended \u00a7101 without saying so\nclearly. We generally presume that Congress \u201cdoes not,\none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman\nv. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468\n(2001).\n   The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999\nlegislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.\n\u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,\u201d however, \u201cform a\nhazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d\nUnited States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a\nlater statute is offered as \u201can expression of how the . . .\nCongress interpreted a statute passed by another Con\ngress . . . a half century before,\u201d \u201csuch interpretation has\nvery little, if any, significance.\u201d Rainwater v. United\nStates, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).\n   Furthermore, even assuming that Congress\u2019 views at\nthe turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a\nvalid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid\n20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid\npetitioners because it does not show that the later Con\ngress itself understood \u00a7101 to cover business methods. If\nanything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir\ncuit understood \u00a7101 in that manner and that Congress\nunderstood what those judges had done. The Act appears\nto reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business\nmethods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow\ning State Street, congressional authorities lamented that\n\u201cbusiness methods and processes . . . until recently were\nthought not to be patentable,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 106\u2013464,\np. 121 (1999); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 106\u2013287, pt. 1, p. 31\n36                        BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(1999).41 The fact that Congress decided it was appropri\nate to create a new defense to claims that business method\npatents were being infringed merely demonstrates recog\nnition that such claims could create a significant new\nproblem for the business community.\n  The Court nonetheless states that the 1999 Act \u201cac\nknowledges that there may be business method patents,\u201d\nthereby \u201cclarify[ing]\u201d its \u201cunderstanding\u201d of \u00a7101. Ante, at\n11. More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to\ninterpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our\ninterpretation \u201cwould render \u00a7273 meaningless.\u201d Ibid. I\nagree that \u201c[a] statute should be construed so that effect is\ngiven to all its provisions.\u201d Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But it is a different matter altogether\nwhen the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to\ngive effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act. The canon\non which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that\n\u201c[a] statute is passed as a whole.\u201d 2A N. Singer & J.\nSinger, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a746:5, p. 189\n(7th ed. 2007). But the two statutes in question were not\npassed as a whole.\n  Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly,\nthat Congress would not in one statute include two provi\nsions that are at odds with each other. But as this case\nshows, that sensible reasoning can break down when\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  41 See also 145 Cong. Rec. 30985 (1999) (remarks of Sen.

Although repudiating that judicial\ndictum (as we should) might effectively render the 1999\nAct a nullity going forward, such a holding would not\nmean that it was a nullity when Congress enacted it.\nSection 273 may have been a technically unnecessary\nresponse to confusion about patentable subject matter, but\nit appeared necessary in 1999 in light of what was being\ndiscussed in legal circles at the time.43 Consider the logi\ncal implications of the Court\u2019s approach to this question:\nIf, tomorrow, Congress were to conclude that patents on\nbusiness methods are so important that the special in\nfringement defense in \u00a7273 ought to be abolished, and\nthus repealed that provision, this could paradoxically\nstrengthen the case against such patents because there\nwould no longer be a \u00a7273 that \u201cacknowledges . . . business\nmethod patents,\u201d ante, at 11. That is not a sound method\nof statutory interpretation.\n   In light of its history and purpose, I think it obvious\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  42 The  Court opines that \u201c[t]his principle, of course, applies to inter\npreting any two provisions in the U. S. Code, even when Congress\nenacted the provisions at different times.\u201d Ante, at 11 (emphasis\nadded). The only support the Court offers for this proposition is a 1937\nopinion for three Justices, in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Or\nganization, 307 U. S. 496, 528\u2013530 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). But\nthat opinion is inapposite. Although Justice Stone stated that two\nprovisions \u201cmust be read together,\u201d id., at 530, he did so to explain that\nan ambiguity in a later-in-time statute must be understood in light of\nthe earlier-in-time framework against which the ambiguous statute\nwas passed, id., at 528\u2013530, particularly because the later statute\nexplicitly stated that it \u201cshall not be construed to apply\u201d to the provi\nsion created by an earlier Act, id., at 528.\n  43 I am not trying to \u201covercome\u201d an \u201cestablished rule of statutory in\n\nterpretation\u201d with \u201cjudicial speculation as to the subjective intent of\nvarious legislators,\u201d ante, at 11, but, rather, I am explaining why the\nCourt has illogically expanded the canon upon which it relies beyond\nthat canon\u2019s logical underpinnings.\n38                        BILSKI v.

Although there\nis certainly disagreement about the need for patents,\nscholars generally agree that when innovation is expen\nsive, risky, and easily copied, inventors are less likely to\nundertake the guaranteed costs of innovation in order to\nobtain the mere possibility of an invention that others can\ncopy.45 Both common sense and recent economic scholar\nship suggest that these dynamics of cost, risk, and reward\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  45 See generally W.

Although counterfactuals are a dubious form\nof analysis, I find it hard to believe that many of our en\ntrepreneurs forwent business innovation because they\ncould not claim a patent on their new methods.\n   \u201c[C]ompanies have ample incentives to develop business\nmethods even without patent protection, because the\ncompetitive marketplace rewards companies that use\nmore efficient business methods.\u201d Burk & Lemley 1618.49\nInnovators often capture advantages from new business\nmethods notwithstanding the risk of others copying their\ninnovation.

S.,\nat 483.\n   In any event, even if patents on business methods were\nuseful for encouraging innovation and disclosure, it would\nstill be questionable whether they would, on balance,\nfacilitate or impede the progress of American business.\nFor even when patents encourage innovation and disclo\nsure, \u201ctoo much patent protection can impede rather than\n\u2018promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts.\u2019 \u201d Laboratory\nCorp. of America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.,\n548 U. S. 124, 126\u2013127 (2006) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom dismissal of certiorari). Patents \u201ccan discourage\nresearch by impeding the free exchange of information,\u201d\nfor example, by forcing people to \u201cavoid the use of poten\ntially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly\nand time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat\nents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by\nraising the costs of using the patented\u201d methods. Id., at\n127. Although \u201c[e]very patent is the grant of a privilege of\nexacting tolls from the public,\u201d Great Atlantic, 340 U. S.,\nat 154 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on\nbusiness methods may be especially high.\n   The primary concern is that patents on business meth\nods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition\nand innovation. As one scholar explains, \u201cit is useful to\nconceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are\non top; specific applications are at the bottom.\u201d Dreyfuss\n275. The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the\ngreater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to\nfurther innovation.53 Thus, this Court stated in Benson\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 53 See   Dreyfuss 276; Merges & Nelson, On the Complex Economics of\n44                       BILSKI v.

S., at 67; see also, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.,\n180 F. 2d, at 28 (\u201cTo give appellant a monopoly, through\nthe issuance of a patent, upon so great an area . . . would\nin our view impose without warrant of law a serious re\nstraint upon the advance of science and industry\u201d). Busi\nness methods are similarly often closer to \u201cbig ideas,\u201d as\nthey are the basic tools of commercial work. They are\nalso, in many cases, the basic tools of further business\ninnovation: Innovation in business methods is often a\nsequential and complementary process in which imitation\nmay be a \u201cspur to innovation\u201d and patents may \u201cbecome an\nimpediment.\u201d Bessen & Maskin, Sequential Innovation,\nPatents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J. Econ. 611, 613\n(2009).54 \u201cThink how the airline industry might now be\nstructured if the first company to offer frequent flyer miles\nhad enjoyed the sole right to award them.\u201d Dreyfuss 264.\n\u201c[I]mitation and refinement through imitation are both\nnecessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a\ncompetitive economy.\u201d Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146.\n   If business methods could be patented, then many busi\nness decisions, no matter how small, could be potential\npatent violations. Businesses would either live in constant\nfear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of\nsearching through patents that describe methods of doing\nbusiness, attempting to decide whether their innovation is\none that remains in the public domain.

But as we have long\nexplained, patents should not \u201cembaras[s] the honest\npursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of con\ncealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexa\ntious accountings for profits made in good faith.\u201d Atlantic\nWorks v. Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 200 (1883).55\n   These effects are magnified by the \u201cpotential vagueness\u201d\nof business method patents, eBay Inc., 547 U. S., at 397\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). When it comes to patents,\n\u201cclarity is essential to promote progress.\u201d Festo Corp., 535\nU. S., at 730\u2013731. Yet patents on methods of conducting\nbusiness generally are composed largely or entirely of\nintangible steps. Compared to \u201cthe kinds of goods . . .\naround which patent rules historically developed,\u201d it thus\ntends to be more costly and time consuming to search\nthrough, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business\nmethods. See Long 539, 470.56\n   The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in\nour society, and their potential vagueness also invite a\nparticularly pernicious use of patents that we have long\ncriticized. As early as the 19th century, we explained that\nthe patent laws are not intended to \u201ccreat[e] a class of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  55 There is substantial academic debate, moreover, about whether the\n\nnormal process of screening patents for novelty and obviousness can\nfunction effectively for business methods. The argument goes that\nbecause business methods are both vague and not confined to any one\nindustry, there is not a well-confined body of prior art to consult, and\ntherefore many \u201cbad\u201d patents are likely to issue, a problem that would\nneed to be sorted out in later litigation. See, e.g., Dreyfuss 268\u2013270;\nEisenberg, Analyze This: A Law and Economics Agenda for the Patent\nSystem, 53 Vand. L. Rev. 2081, 2090 (2000); Merges 589\u2013590.\n  56 See also J. Bessen & M.

Concededly, alterations in the rem\nedy structure, such as the First Inventor Defense Act of 1999, \u00a74301 et\nseq., 113 Stat. 1536, codified at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7273, mitigate these costs.\n46                      BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nspeculative schemers who make it their business to watch\nthe advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam\nin the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to\nlay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without\ncontributing anything to the real advancement of the\narts.\u201d Atlantic Works, 107 U. S., at 200. Yet business\nmethod patents may have begun to do exactly that. See\neBay Inc., 547 U. S., at 396\u2013397 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n   These many costs of business method patents not only\nmay stifle innovation, but they are also likely to \u201cstifle\ncompetition,\u201d Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146. Even if a\nbusiness method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent\nholders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to\nbully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the\ncosts of a drawn out, fact-intensive patent litigation.57\nThat can take a particular toll on small and upstart busi\nnesses.58 Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to\ncompetition for the type of subject matter that is patented.\nBut patents on business methods are patents on business\nitself. Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of\npatents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the\ndynamism of the marketplace.59\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  57 See generally Farrell & Shapiro, How Strong Are Weak Patents?\n\n98 Amer.

If methods of conducting business\nwere themselves patentable, then virtually any novel, nonobvious\nbusiness method could be granted a federally protected monopoly. The\ntension this might create with our antitrust regime provides yet an\nother reason for skepticism that Congress would have wanted the\npatent laws to extend to business methods.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n6. But Congress has not, either explicitly or implicitly,\ndetermined that patents on methods of doing business\nwould effectuate this aim. And as I understand their\npractical consequences, it is hard to see how they would.\n                              VII\n  The Constitution grants to Congress an important\npower to promote innovation. In its exercise of that power,\nCongress has established an intricate system of intellec\ntual property. The scope of patentable subject matter\nunder that system is broad. But it is not endless. In the\nabsence of any clear guidance from Congress, we have only\nlimited textual, historical, and functional clues on which\nto rely. Those clues all point toward the same conclusion:\nthat petitioners\u2019 claim is not a \u201cprocess\u201d within the mean\ning of \u00a7101 because methods of doing business are not, in\nthemselves, covered by the statute. In my view, acknowl\nedging as much would be a far more sensible and re\nstrained way to resolve this case. Accordingly, while I\nconcur in the judgment, I strongly disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s disposition of this case.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. \u00a7101. Ante, at\n2 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). This Court has\nnever before held that so-called \u201cbusiness methods\u201d are\npatentable, and, in my view, the text, history, and pur\nposes of the Patent Act make clear that they are not.\nAnte, at 10\u201347. I would therefore decide this case on that\nground, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion in full.\n  I write separately, however, in order to highlight the\nsubstantial agreement among many Members of the Court\non many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by\nthis case. In light of the need for clarity and settled law in\nthis highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.\n                             II\n  In addition to the Court\u2019s unanimous agreement that\nthe claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it\nis my view that the following four points are consistent\n2                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwith both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019\nopinion concurring in the judgment:\n   First, although the text of \u00a7101 is broad, it is not with\nout limit. See ante, at 4\u20135 (opinion of the Court); ante, at\n10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). \u201c[T]he underly\ning policy of the patent system [is] that \u2018the things which\nare worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive\npatent,\u2019 . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the\nlimited patent monopoly.\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co. of\nKansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (1966) (quoting Letter\nfrom Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,\n1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing\nton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting\nthe Patent Act to \u201cdetermine not only what is protected,\nbut also what is free for all to use.\u201d Bonito Boats, Inc. v.\nThunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In\nparticular, the Court has long held that \u201c[p]henomena of\nnature, though just discovered, mental processes, and\nabstract intellectual concepts are not patentable\u201d under\n\u00a7101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda\nmental principles would \u201cwholly pre-empt\u201d the public\u2019s\naccess to the \u201cbasic tools of scientific and technological\nwork.\u201d Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);\nsee also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);\nDiamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).\n   Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a\ncentury, the Court has stated that \u201c[t]ransformation and\nreduction of an article to a different state or thing is the\nclue to the patentability of a process claim that does not\ninclude particular machines.\u201d Diehr, supra, at 184 (em\nphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,\ne.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,\n588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788\n(1877). Application of this test, the so-called \u201cmachine-or\ntransformation test,\u201d has thus repeatedly helped the Court\nto determine what is \u201ca patentable \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d Flook, supra,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 589.\n   Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has\nalways been a \u201cuseful and important clue,\u201d it has never\nbeen the \u201csole test\u201d for determining patentability. Ante, at\n8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that\n\u201cno process patent could ever qualify\u201d for protection under\n\u00a7101 \u201cif it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]\nrequirements\u201d). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a\nprocess claim meets the requirements of \u00a7101 when, \u201ccon\nsidered as a whole,\u201d it \u201cis performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or\nreducing an article to a different state or thing).\u201d Diehr,\nsupra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus\nan important example of how a court can determine pat\nentability under \u00a7101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this\ncase by treating it as the exclusive test.\n   Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is\nnot the only test for patentability, this by no means indi\ncates that anything which produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete,\nand tangible result,\u2019 \u201d State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.\nSignature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA\nFed. 1998), is patentable. \u201c[T]his Court has never made\nsuch a statement and, if taken literally, the statement\nwould cover instances where this Court has held the con\ntrary.\u201d Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo\nlite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted); see also, e.g., O\u2019Reilly v. Morse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86821\"><a href=\"/opinion/86821/oreilly-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117\n(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of\nthe \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible result\u201d approach to\npatentability, associated with the Federal Circuit\u2019s State\nStreet decision, preceded the granting of patents that\n\u201cranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab\nsurd.\u201d In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)\n(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a\n4                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cmethod of training janitors to dust and vacuum using\nvideo displays,\u201d a \u201csystem for toilet reservations,\u201d and a\n\u201cmethod of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating\nstatus in order to limit \u2018the embarrassment of rejection\u2019 \u201d);\nsee also Brief for Respondent 40\u201341, and n. 20 (listing\ndubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in\ntoday\u2019s decision should be taken as disapproving of that\ndetermination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the\n\u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not necessarily the\nsole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de\nemphasize the test\u2019s usefulness nor to suggest that many\npatentable processes lie beyond its reach.\n                        III\n  With these observations, I concur in the Court\u2019s\njudgment.\n</pre>",
