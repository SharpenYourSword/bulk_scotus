STEPHEN UPTON, \n\n                   WARDEN \n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF GEORGIA\n\n              No. 09–8854. Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   According to an expert who testified during state post\nconviction relief, petitioner Demarcus A. Sears performs at\nor below the bottom first percentile in several measures of\ncognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this\nabnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain\ndamage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and\nalcohol abuse in his teens. But because—in the words of\nthe state trial court—his counsel conducted a penalty\nphase investigation that was “on its face . . . constitution\nally inadequate,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence\nrelating to Sears’ cognitive impairments and childhood\ndifficulties was not brought to light at the time he was\nsentenced to death.\n   After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per\nformance under the framework we set forth in Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the state postconvic\ntion court found itself unable to assess whether counsel’s\ninadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B. Because Sears’ counsel\ndid present some mitigation evidence during Sears’ pen\nalty phase—but not the significant mitigation evidence a\nconstitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov\nered—the state court determined it could not speculate as\nto what the effect of additional evidence would have been.\nId., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction\nrelief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.\n2                           SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n  For the reasons that follow, it is plain from the face of\nthe state court’s opinion that it failed to apply the correct\nprejudice inquiry we have established for evaluating\nSears’ Sixth Amendment claim. We therefore grant the\npetition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and\nremand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.1\n                               I\n   In 1993, a Georgia jury convicted Sears of armed rob\nbery and kidnaping with bodily injury (which also resulted\nin death), a capital crime under state law. See Ga. Code\nAnn. §16–5–40(d)(4) (2006).2 During the penalty phase of\nSears’ capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describ\ning his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without\nincident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the\nfollowing lines: Sears came from a middle-class back\nground; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives;\nand a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate\nthe family. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7. Counsel’s mitigation\n——————\n  1 Although this is a state-court decision, it resolved a federal issue on\n\nexclusively federal-law grounds. We therefore have jurisdiction. 28\nU. S. C. §1257; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)\n(reviewing state postconviction decision raising Sixth Amendment\nquestion).\n  2 Sears was sentenced to death for the Kentucky murder of a woman\n\nwhom he and an accomplice kidnaped in Georgia. Under Georgia law,\na jury may “impose a death sentence for the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury on the ground that the offense of kidnapping with bodily\ninjury was committed while the offender was engaged in the commis\nsion of the capital felon[y] of murder . . . .” Potts v.

E. 2d 89, 93 (1991). So long as “the murder . . . [is] suffi\nciently a part of the same criminal transaction,” it may count as a\n“statutory aggravating circumstanc[e] of the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury.” Ibid., 410 S. E. 2d, at 94. Sears has raised a categorical\nEighth Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of his death\nsentence for a kidnaping offense, which we decline to reach. And any\njurisdictional or constitutional issue with respect to Georgia’s ability to\nexecute Sears for a murder occurring in Kentucky is not before us.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

But the strategy backfired. The prosecu\ntor ultimately used the evidence of Sears’ purportedly\nstable and advantaged upbringing against him during the\nState’s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told\nthe jury, “[w]e don’t have a deprived child from an inner\ncity; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an\nearly age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every\nway, who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded\nhim.” Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting trial transcript; internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state\npostconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demon\nstrates that Sears was far from “privileged in every way.”\nSears’ home life, while filled with material comfort, was\nanything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abu\nsive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of\nDemetrius A. Sears), and divorced when Sears was young,\nExh. 22, id., at 1654 (Affidavit of Virginia Sears Graves);\nhe suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent\nmale cousin, Exh. 26, id., at 1681–1682; his mother’s\n“favorite word for referring to her sons was ‘little mother\nfuckers,’ ” Exh. 3, 2 Record 265 (Affidavit of Richard G.\nDudley, Jr., MD); and his father was “verbally abusive,”\nExh. 37, 6 Record 1746–1747 (Affidavit of Carol Becci-\nYoungs),3 and disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate\n\n——————\n  3 In the particular instance recounted in this affidavit, Sears’ art\n\nteacher stated that his father “berate[d] [him] in front of” the school\nprincipal and her during a parent-teacher conference. Exh. 37, 6 Record\n1746. The event was significant: “I’ll never forget the way he bullied\nhim,” the art teacher explained, “Mr. Sears was so verbally abusive and\nmade such a scene, that it made everyone in the room uncomfortable.”\nIbid. The art teacher had “never been in a conference where a parent\nseverely criticized a child in the presence of his teachers and meant it,\nas Mr. Sears did.” Id., at 1747.\n4                     SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmilitary-style drills, Exh. 3, 2 Record 263–264; Exh. 19, 6\nRecord 1622 (Affidavit of Frank Sears); Exh. 22, id., at\n1651; Exh. 28, id., at 1694 (Affidavit of Kenneth Burns,\nSr.). Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial\nbehavior problems from a very young age. For example,\nSears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500–\n501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua\ntion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508. By the time\nSears reached high school, he was “described as severely\nlearning disabled and as severely behaviorally handi\ncapped.” Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 Record 174–176 (Affidavit of\nTony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).\n   Environmental factors aside, and more significantly,\nevidence produced during the state postconviction relief\nprocess also revealed that Sears suffered “significant\nfrontal lobe abnormalities.” Exh. 1, id., at 147. Two dif\nferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub\nstantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning—i.e.,\n“problems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,”\nibid.—as a result of several serious head injuries he suf\nfered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1\nRecord 37–40 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95–96\n(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his\nbrain damage, his scores on at least two standardized\nassessment tests placed him at or below the first percen\ntile in several categories of cognitive function, “making\nhim among the most impaired individuals in the popula\ntion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses\nand conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.” Exh. 1, 2\nRecord 148; see also 1 Record 37. The assessment also\nrevealed that Sears’ “ability to organize his choices, assign\nthem relative weight and select among them in a deliber\nate way is grossly impaired.” Exh. 1, 2 Record 149. From\nan etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears’\n“history is replete with multiple head trauma, substance\nabuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected” to\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 150; see also\n1 Record 44.\n   Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the\nsources relied upon by Sears’ experts—informal personal\naccounts, see post, at 5–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.)—it does\nnot undermine the well-credentialed expert’s assessment,4\nbased on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing,\nand observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from\nsubstantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dis\nmally on several of the forensic tests administered to him\nto assess his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word\nInterference Test, which measures response inhibition, id.,\nat 36–37, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which\naccounts for age, education, and background) performed\nbetter than he did. Ibid. On the Trail-Making B test,\nwhich also measures frontal lobe functioning, id., at 37–\n38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile.\nId., at 38. Based on these results, the expert’s first-hand\nobservations, and an extensive review of Sears’ personal\nhistory, the expert’s opinion was unequivocal: There is\n“clear and compelling evidence” that Sears has “pro\nnounced frontal lobe pathology.”5 Id., at 68.\n——————\n   4 Dr. Strickland, a psychologist, is the director of a mild head injury\n\nclinic and the Sports Concussion Institute at Centinella Freeman\nMedical Center in Los Angeles. 1 Record 30. He is an associate profes\nsor of psychiatry in residence at the University of California at Los\nAngeles and directs a memory disorder and cerebral palsy clinic for\nthat university’s department of neuroscience. Id., at 30–31. The State\nhad no objection to his being tendered as an expert in neuropsychology.\nId., at 31.\n   5 During a colloquy with the court, Dr. Strickland further explained:\n\n   “THE COURT: But by taking some history of head injuries, coupled\nwith the results of the tests that you’ve given, you can comfortably\nconclude that the results of the tests that you’ve given were a conse\nquence of frontal lobe head injuries?\n   “THE WITNESS: Absolutely. And, moreover, Your Honor, the\npatient has a lesion on the front of his head, which is something I can\nobserve.” Id., at 78.\n6                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n  Further, the fact that Sears’ brother is a convicted drug\ndealer and user, and introduced Sears to a life of crime, 6\nRecord 1683–1686, actually would have been consistent\nwith a mitigation theory portraying Sears as an individual\nwith diminished judgment and reasoning skills, who may\nhave desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother\nwho had shut him out of his life. Post, at 6. And the fact\nthat some of such evidence may have been “hearsay” does\nnot necessarily undermine its value—or its admissibility—\nfor penalty phase purposes.6 Post, at 5, n. 3.\n  Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation\nevidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsur\nprising, post, at 7, given that counsel’s initial mitigation\ninvestigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent\ncounsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse\nevidence into a positive—perhaps in support of a cognitive\ndeficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of\nSears’ grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magi\ncal thinking, ibid., were features, in another well\ncredentialed expert’s view,7 of a “profound personality\n——————\n    6 LikeGeorgia’s “necessity exception” to its hearsay rules, see Ga.\nCode Ann. §24–3–1(b) (2006), we have also recognized that reliable\nhearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant’s mitigation\ndefense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay\nrule. See Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (“Re\ngardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia’s\nhearsay rule, under the facts of this case its exclusion constituted a\nviolation of the Due Process Clause . . . . The excluded testimony was\nhighly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial”);\nsee also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302 (1973) (“In these\ncircumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascer\ntainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied\nmechanistically to defeat the ends of justice”). We take no view on\nwhether the evidence at issue would satisfy the considerations we set\nforth in Green, or would be otherwise admissible under Georgia law.\n   7 Dr. Dudley, a psychiatrist, completed his internship and residency\n\nat Northwestern University Medical Center, and has been board\ncertified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neu\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This evidence might not have\nmade Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well\nhave helped the jury understand Sears, and his horren\ndous acts—especially in light of his purportedly stable\nupbringing.\n   Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation\ninvestigation, none of this evidence was known to Sears’\ntrial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction\nrelief.\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the state postconviction trial court\nconcluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel’s\npenalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688 (explaining that first\ninquiry when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness\nclaim is whether counsel’s representation “fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness”). In its view, the\ncursory nature of counsel’s investigation into mitigation\nevidence—“limited to one day or less, talking to witnesses\nselected by [Sears’] mother”—was “on its face . . . constitu\ntionally inadequate.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.\n   What is surprising, however, is the court’s analysis\nregarding whether counsel’s facially inadequate mitigation\ninvestigation prejudiced Sears. See Strickland, supra, at\n694. Although the court appears to have stated the proper\nprejudice standard,8 it did not correctly conceptualize how\nthat standard applies to the circumstances of this case.\n——————\nrology for more than 35 years. 1 Record 91–92. The State also had no\nobjection to his being tendered as an expert in psychiatry. Id., at 93.\n  8 The court asked whether “there is a reasonable likelihood that the\n\noutcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had done\nmore investigation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B; see Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694 (“The defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome”).\n8                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nBecause Sears’ counsel did present some mitigation evi\ndence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that\n“[t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where\nlittle or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a\nreasonable prediction of outcome can be made.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that “it is impossi\nble to know what effect [a different mitigation theory]\nwould have had on [the jury].” Ibid. “Because counsel put\nforth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,” the\ncourt reasoned, “[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of\nproving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the\noutcome at trial would have been different if a different\nmitigation theory had been advanced.”9 Ibid.\n   There are two errors in the state court’s analysis of\nSears’ Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed\na more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue\nreliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel’s miti\ngation theory. The court’s determination that counsel had\nconducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investi\ngation, should have, at the very least, called into question\nthe reasonableness of this theory. Cf. Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (explaining that “counsel’s fail\nure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evi\ndence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their obli\n——————\n  9 Channeling powers of telepathy, JUSTICE SCALIA asserts that what\n\nthe trial court actually decided in this case is that “Sears’ trial counsel\npresented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult—so\ndifficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing.” Post, at 4.\nSuch a highly favorable reading of the trial court’s analysis would be\nfar more convincing had the trial court engaged with the evidence as\nJUSTICE SCALIA does. But it offered no such analysis in its opinion;\nindeed, it appears the court did not even conduct any real analysis,\nexplaining that it was “impossible to know what effect” the evidence\nmight have had on the jury. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis\nadded).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S.\n362, 396 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the\npoint, that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract,\ndoes not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel’s\nfailure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation\nbefore arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears.\nThe “reasonableness” of counsel’s theory was, at this stage\nin the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced\nby his counsel’s failures, whether his haphazard choice\nwas reasonable or not.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA chides the Court for concluding that the\ntrial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel’s\nmitigation theory was a reasonable one. Post, at 2. But\nour point is that any finding with respect to the reason\nableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized—in this\ncase, family impact—is in tension with the trial court’s\nunambiguous finding that counsel’s investigation was\nitself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.\nThis point is plain in Williams: We rejected any suggestion\nthat a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial\nstrategy—in that case, petitioner’s voluntary confession—\nwas “justified by a tactical decision” when “counsel did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant’s background.” 529 U. S., at 396. A\n“tactical decision” is a precursor to concluding that coun\nsel has developed a “reasonable” mitigation theory in a\nparticular case.10\n——————\n  10 Moreover, the reasonableness of the theory is not relevant when\nevaluating the impact of evidence that would have been available and\nlikely introduced, had counsel completed a constitutionally adequate\ninvestigation before settling on a particular mitigation theory. This\npoint was also plain in Williams: “Whether or not . . . omissions [in the\ninvestigation] were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome\nof sentencing,” they may nevertheless demonstrate deficiency. 529\nU. S., at 396. The one inquiry, deficient mitigation investigation, is\n10                        SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to\napply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited\nthe prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which\nthere was only “little or no mitigation evidence” presented,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases\ninvolving such circumstances,11 and we have explained\nthat there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi\ndence “would barely have altered the sentencing profile\npresented” to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at\n700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in\nother cases in which counsel presented what could be\ndescribed as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory\nduring the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398\n(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most\nrecently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had\nattempted to blame his client’s bad acts on his drunken\nness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation\nevidence relating to his client’s heroic military service and\nsubstantial mental health difficulties that came to light\nonly during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at\n11–12). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but—\nbound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)—\nwe also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap\nplied Strickland’s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por\nter’s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   We certainly have never held that counsel’s effort to\npresent some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves\ntigation might have prejudiced the defendant. To the\ncontrary, we have consistently explained that the Strick\n——————\ndistinct from the second, whether there was prejudice as a result.\n  11See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 515–516 (2003); Strick\n\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 700 (1984).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 397–398. And, in Porter, we recently explained:\n                   \t\n     “To assess [the] probability [of a different outcome\n     under Strickland], we consider the totality of the\n     available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at\n     trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceed\n     ing—and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggrava\n     tion.” 558 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo\n     tation marks omitted; third alteration in original).\nThat same standard applies—and will necessarily require\na court to “speculate” as to the effect of the new evidence—\nregardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence\nwas presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it\nis exactly this kind of probing inquiry that JUSTICE SCALIA\nnow undertakes, post, at 4–8, and that the trial court\nfailed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper preju\ndice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective repre\nsentation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation\ninvestigation.\n\n——————\n   12 Whether it did so implicitly is far from apparent, notwithstanding\n\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion to the contrary. See post, at 3–4. The trial\ncourt stated that the record was “largely silent” on “what [evidence]\nwould have been shown if [additional mitigating evidence] had been\nsought.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 28B.

See Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n11); Williams, supra, at 397–398; Strickland, supra, at\n694.

Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The Court concludes, ante, at 7–12, that the Superior\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in\napplying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the\nCourt today remands for the state court to do what it has\nalready done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti\ngation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have\npersuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen\ntence for this brutal rape-murder.\n   The state habeas court responsibly executed the first\nstep in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga\ntion of mitigation evidence by Sears’ trial counsel was\ndeficient performance. The issue here is the second step:\nwhether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court\ncorrectly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:\nThe defendant has the burden to establish “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 24B–25B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,\n694). “When applied to the sentencing phase of death\npenalty trials,” that means “a reasonable probability that,\nabsent [counsel’s] errors, the sentencer would have con\ncluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” App. to Pet. for\n2                      SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCert. 25B–26B.\n   The Court today concludes that there were two errors in\nthe application of that proper standard. First, it reasons\nthat the court erroneously “curtailed a more probing\nprejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the\nassumed reasonableness of counsel’s mitigation theory” at\ntrial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several\nlevels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as\nsume trial counsel’s mitigation theory was reasonable; it\nfound that it was. It said: “[A]lthough counsel failed to\ninvestigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable\nmitigation theory with evidence to support it.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen\npotential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of\nSears’ father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his\nfamily, see 7 Record 2025, 2051–2052; 8 id., at 2129,\n2291–2344, Sears’ trial counsel developed a mitigation\ntheory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid\nmiddle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely\nout of character; that he cooperated with police; and that\nsentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and\nfriends, see id., at 2124–2125; 19 id., at 4861–4862, 4916–\n4917, 4954–4955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap\nproach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including\nSears’ mother, four family friends, and his high school\nguidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7 (citing trial\ntranscript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha\nbeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory\n“might be reasonable, in the abstract,” as the Court puts\nit, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel “put forth\na reasonable theory with supporting evidence.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B.\n   The Court’s argument is also flawed because the habeas\ncourt’s reasonableness finding did not cause it to “curtai[l]”\nits prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could\n“obviate the need to analyze” whether pursuing a different\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmitigation theory would have made a difference. Ante, at\n9. The reasonableness finding merely meant that the\nprejudice determination had to be made by asking, not\nwhether the jury’s mind would probably have been\nchanged by hearing Sears’ new mitigation theory instead\nof hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether\nit would probably have been changed by substituting\nSears’ new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation\ntheory that was presented and rejected.1 After hearing all\nthe witnesses and other evidence Sears presented before\nit, the state court concluded that “it is just not possible to\nknow what effect a different mitigation theory would have\nhad.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).2\n   The second, “and more fundamenta[l],” legal error the\nCourt alleges, ante, at 10–11, is really encased within the\nfirst. The Court claims that the state habeas court “lim\nited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in\nwhich there was only ‘little or no mitigation evidence’\npresented.” Id., at 10 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B).\nThe court erred, we are told, by determining that “pre\nsent[ation of] some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether” Sears was prejudiced. Ibid. That is\nnot a fair reading of the opinion. The state court did not\nhold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice when\never his counsel provided any mitigation evidence.\nRather, it stated that “[t]his case cannot be fairly com\n——————\n  1 The Court contends, ante, at 9, that there was a “tension” between\nthe state court’s conclusion that the investigation was deficient and its\nconclusion that the mitigation theory presented to the jury was reason\nable. This terribly misreads the state court’s opinion. It did not say (as\nthe Court’s point assumes) that counsel’s using the mitigation theory\nthey did was reasonable; it said that the theory itself was reasonable,\nmaking it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded\nthe jury. This presents no conceivable “tension.”\n  2 On the fair reading we owe the state court, its opinion provides no\n\nbasis for inferring that it failed to “engag[e] with the evidence” and “did\nnot even conduct any real analysis.” Ante, at 8, n. 8.\n4                    SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is\npresented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome\ncan be made.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis\nadded). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like\nthe prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it\ncould readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory\nwould have made a much deeper impression on the jury\nthan the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any\ntheory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears’ trial counsel presented a\nreasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more\ndifficult—so difficult that Sears could not make the requi\nsite showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this\nparticular case, the court said:\n    “Although here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior\n    appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having\n    reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not\n    possible to know what effect a different mitigation\n    theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible\n    to know what effect it would have had on other ju\n    rors.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.\n   Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to\nits Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the\njudgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion\nitself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga\ntion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose\na life sentence instead of death.\n   The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu\nsion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into\nthe 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the\nevidence supporting Sears’ new mitigation theory—an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Dr. Dudley’s affidavit portrays\nSears as arrogant and self-centered, id., at 246, 247, and\nnotes what he termed Sears’ “fantastical” boasting of his\nfirst sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and\nhis other “innumerable sexual experiences,” 1 id., at 98–\n99, 100; 2 id., at 246–247. It is hard to see how it could be\nthought probable that Sears’ so-called “magical thinking,”\n1 id., at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see\nante, at 6–7. It seems to me more likely the jury would\nconclude that Sears’ “profoun[d] personality disorder,”\n1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who\nwould commit heinous crimes in the future.\n   And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so ut\nterly unlikely to affect a jury’s determination that this\nbrutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just\nplain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears’ father\n“was ‘verbally abusive,’ ” ante, at 3, resting on nothing\nmore than an art teacher’s recollection that Sears’ father\n“severely criticized” him—“and meant it”!—at a conference\nwith the principal concerning his son’s poor academic\nperformance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father\n“disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style\ndrills,” ante, at 3–4, which consisted of positively Von-\nSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water\nwhen he refused to get up for school, and making him run\nextra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the\nclaim that his mother’s “ ‘favorite word’ ”—actually three\nwords—to refer to her sons was scatological, ante, at 3\n(quoting 2 Record 265).\n   While the Court takes pain to describe all the elements\nof Sears’ new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it\ndoes not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of\n8                          SEARS v.

Sears, carrying a briefcase contain\ning various instruments of mayhem—brass knuckles,\nknives, and handcuffs—and his accomplice, Phillip Wil\nliams, were surveying a supermarket parking lot on a\nSunday evening in October 1990, looking for a car to steal\nto drive back home to Ohio from Georgia. As the victim\nwas putting her groceries in the trunk of her car, Sears\napproached, punched her in the face with his brass knuck\nles, shoved her into the car, and drove to pick up Williams.\nSears then handcuffed her and pulled her into the back\nseat as Williams drove. After they passed into Tennessee,\nSears raped her. Later in the evening, after they had\ncrossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car.\nSears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the\nside of the highway as she begged for her life. After\nthrowing her on the ground, he stabbed her in the neck.\nIn his confession he showed no regret or remorse for his\nheinous crimes.5\n   I do not know how anyone could disagree with the ha\nbeas court’s conclusion that it is impossible to say that\nsubstituting the “deprived-childhood-cum-brain-damage”\ndefense for the “good-middle-class-kid-who-made-a\nmistake” defense would probably have produced a differ\nent verdict.

Sears performs at\nor below the bottom first percentile in several measures of\ncognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this\nabnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain\ndamage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and\nalcohol abuse in his teens. But because—in the words of\nthe state trial court—his counsel conducted a penalty\nphase investigation that was “on its face . . . constitution\nally inadequate,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence\nrelating to Sears’ cognitive impairments and childhood\ndifficulties was not brought to light at the time he was\nsentenced to death.\n   After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per\nformance under the framework we set forth in Strickland\nv.

Because Sears’ counsel\ndid present some mitigation evidence during Sears’ pen\nalty phase—but not the significant mitigation evidence a\nconstitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov\nered—the state court determined it could not speculate as\nto what the effect of additional evidence would have been.\nId., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction\nrelief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.\n2                           SEARS v.

See Ga. Code\nAnn. §16–5–40(d)(4) (2006).2 During the penalty phase of\nSears’ capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describ\ning his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without\nincident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the\nfollowing lines: Sears came from a middle-class back\nground; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives;\nand a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate\nthe family. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7. Counsel’s mitigation\n——————\n  1 Although this is a state-court decision, it resolved a federal issue on\n\nexclusively federal-law grounds. We therefore have jurisdiction. 28\nU. S. C. §1257; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)\n(reviewing state postconviction decision raising Sixth Amendment\nquestion).\n  2 Sears was sentenced to death for the Kentucky murder of a woman\n\nwhom he and an accomplice kidnaped in Georgia. Under Georgia law,\na jury may “impose a death sentence for the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury on the ground that the offense of kidnapping with bodily\ninjury was committed while the offender was engaged in the commis\nsion of the capital felon[y] of murder . . . .” Potts v. State, 261 Ga. 716,\n720, 410 S. E. 2d 89, 93 (1991). So long as “the murder . . . [is] suffi\nciently a part of the same criminal transaction,” it may count as a\n“statutory aggravating circumstanc[e] of the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury.” Ibid., 410 S. E. 2d, at 94. Sears has raised a categorical\nEighth Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of his death\nsentence for a kidnaping offense, which we decline to reach. And any\njurisdictional or constitutional issue with respect to Georgia’s ability to\nexecute Sears for a murder occurring in Kentucky is not before us.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

But the strategy backfired. The prosecu\ntor ultimately used the evidence of Sears’ purportedly\nstable and advantaged upbringing against him during the\nState’s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told\nthe jury, “[w]e don’t have a deprived child from an inner\ncity; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an\nearly age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every\nway, who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded\nhim.” Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting trial transcript; internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state\npostconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demon\nstrates that Sears was far from “privileged in every way.”\nSears’ home life, while filled with material comfort, was\nanything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abu\nsive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of\nDemetrius A. Sears), and divorced when Sears was young,\nExh. 22, id., at 1654 (Affidavit of Virginia Sears Graves);\nhe suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent\nmale cousin, Exh. 26, id., at 1681–1682; his mother’s\n“favorite word for referring to her sons was ‘little mother\nfuckers,’ ” Exh. 3, 2 Record 265 (Affidavit of Richard G.\nDudley, Jr., MD); and his father was “verbally abusive,”\nExh. 37, 6 Record 1746–1747 (Affidavit of Carol Becci-\nYoungs),3 and disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate\n\n——————\n  3 In the particular instance recounted in this affidavit, Sears’ art\n\nteacher stated that his father “berate[d] [him] in front of” the school\nprincipal and her during a parent-teacher conference. Exh. 37, 6 Record\n1746. The event was significant: “I’ll never forget the way he bullied\nhim,” the art teacher explained, “Mr. Sears was so verbally abusive and\nmade such a scene, that it made everyone in the room uncomfortable.”\nIbid. The art teacher had “never been in a conference where a parent\nseverely criticized a child in the presence of his teachers and meant it,\nas Mr. Sears did.” Id., at 1747.\n4                     SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmilitary-style drills, Exh. 3, 2 Record 263–264; Exh. 19, 6\nRecord 1622 (Affidavit of Frank Sears); Exh. 22, id., at\n1651; Exh. 28, id., at 1694 (Affidavit of Kenneth Burns,\nSr.). Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial\nbehavior problems from a very young age. For example,\nSears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500–\n501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua\ntion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508. By the time\nSears reached high school, he was “described as severely\nlearning disabled and as severely behaviorally handi\ncapped.” Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 Record 174–176 (Affidavit of\nTony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).\n   Environmental factors aside, and more significantly,\nevidence produced during the state postconviction relief\nprocess also revealed that Sears suffered “significant\nfrontal lobe abnormalities.” Exh. 1, id., at 147. Two dif\nferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub\nstantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning—i.e.,\n“problems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,”\nibid.—as a result of several serious head injuries he suf\nfered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1\nRecord 37–40 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95–96\n(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his\nbrain damage, his scores on at least two standardized\nassessment tests placed him at or below the first percen\ntile in several categories of cognitive function, “making\nhim among the most impaired individuals in the popula\ntion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses\nand conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.” Exh. 1, 2\nRecord 148; see also 1 Record 37. The assessment also\nrevealed that Sears’ “ability to organize his choices, assign\nthem relative weight and select among them in a deliber\nate way is grossly impaired.” Exh. 1, 2 Record 149. From\nan etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears’\n“history is replete with multiple head trauma, substance\nabuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected” to\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 150; see also\n1 Record 44.\n   Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the\nsources relied upon by Sears’ experts—informal personal\naccounts, see post, at 5–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.)—it does\nnot undermine the well-credentialed expert’s assessment,4\nbased on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing,\nand observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from\nsubstantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dis\nmally on several of the forensic tests administered to him\nto assess his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word\nInterference Test, which measures response inhibition, id.,\nat 36–37, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which\naccounts for age, education, and background) performed\nbetter than he did. Ibid. On the Trail-Making B test,\nwhich also measures frontal lobe functioning, id., at 37–\n38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile.\nId., at 38. Based on these results, the expert’s first-hand\nobservations, and an extensive review of Sears’ personal\nhistory, the expert’s opinion was unequivocal: There is\n“clear and compelling evidence” that Sears has “pro\nnounced frontal lobe pathology.”5 Id., at 68.\n——————\n   4 Dr. Strickland, a psychologist, is the director of a mild head injury\n\nclinic and the Sports Concussion Institute at Centinella Freeman\nMedical Center in Los Angeles. 1 Record 30.

The State\nhad no objection to his being tendered as an expert in neuropsychology.\nId., at 31.\n   5 During a colloquy with the court, Dr. Strickland further explained:\n\n   “THE COURT: But by taking some history of head injuries, coupled\nwith the results of the tests that you’ve given, you can comfortably\nconclude that the results of the tests that you’ve given were a conse\nquence of frontal lobe head injuries?\n   “THE WITNESS: Absolutely.

Post, at 6. And the fact\nthat some of such evidence may have been “hearsay” does\nnot necessarily undermine its value—or its admissibility—\nfor penalty phase purposes.6 Post, at 5, n. 3.\n  Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation\nevidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsur\nprising, post, at 7, given that counsel’s initial mitigation\ninvestigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent\ncounsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse\nevidence into a positive—perhaps in support of a cognitive\ndeficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of\nSears’ grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magi\ncal thinking, ibid., were features, in another well\ncredentialed expert’s view,7 of a “profound personality\n——————\n    6 LikeGeorgia’s “necessity exception” to its hearsay rules, see Ga.\nCode Ann. §24–3–1(b) (2006), we have also recognized that reliable\nhearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant’s mitigation\ndefense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay\nrule.

This evidence might not have\nmade Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well\nhave helped the jury understand Sears, and his horren\ndous acts—especially in light of his purportedly stable\nupbringing.\n   Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation\ninvestigation, none of this evidence was known to Sears’\ntrial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction\nrelief.\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the state postconviction trial court\nconcluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel’s\npenalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688 (explaining that first\ninquiry when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness\nclaim is whether counsel’s representation “fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness”). In its view, the\ncursory nature of counsel’s investigation into mitigation\nevidence—“limited to one day or less, talking to witnesses\nselected by [Sears’] mother”—was “on its face . . . constitu\ntionally inadequate.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.\n   What is surprising, however, is the court’s analysis\nregarding whether counsel’s facially inadequate mitigation\ninvestigation prejudiced Sears. See Strickland, supra, at\n694. Although the court appears to have stated the proper\nprejudice standard,8 it did not correctly conceptualize how\nthat standard applies to the circumstances of this case.\n——————\nrology for more than 35 years. 1 Record 91–92. The State also had no\nobjection to his being tendered as an expert in psychiatry. Id., at 93.\n  8 The court asked whether “there is a reasonable likelihood that the\n\noutcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had done\nmore investigation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B–30B; see Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694 (“The defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome”).\n8                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nBecause Sears’ counsel did present some mitigation evi\ndence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that\n“[t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where\nlittle or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a\nreasonable prediction of outcome can be made.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that “it is impossi\nble to know what effect [a different mitigation theory]\nwould have had on [the jury].” Ibid. “Because counsel put\nforth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,” the\ncourt reasoned, “[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of\nproving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the\noutcome at trial would have been different if a different\nmitigation theory had been advanced.”9 Ibid.\n   There are two errors in the state court’s analysis of\nSears’ Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed\na more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue\nreliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel’s miti\ngation theory. The court’s determination that counsel had\nconducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investi\ngation, should have, at the very least, called into question\nthe reasonableness of this theory. Cf. Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (explaining that “counsel’s fail\nure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evi\ndence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their obli\n——————\n  9 Channeling powers of telepathy, JUSTICE SCALIA asserts that what\n\nthe trial court actually decided in this case is that “Sears’ trial counsel\npresented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult—so\ndifficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing.” Post, at 4.\nSuch a highly favorable reading of the trial court’s analysis would be\nfar more convincing had the trial court engaged with the evidence as\nJUSTICE SCALIA does. But it offered no such analysis in its opinion;\nindeed, it appears the court did not even conduct any real analysis,\nexplaining that it was “impossible to know what effect” the evidence\nmight have had on the jury.

S.\n362, 396 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the\npoint, that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract,\ndoes not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel’s\nfailure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation\nbefore arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears.\nThe “reasonableness” of counsel’s theory was, at this stage\nin the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced\nby his counsel’s failures, whether his haphazard choice\nwas reasonable or not.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA chides the Court for concluding that the\ntrial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel’s\nmitigation theory was a reasonable one. Post, at 2. But\nour point is that any finding with respect to the reason\nableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized—in this\ncase, family impact—is in tension with the trial court’s\nunambiguous finding that counsel’s investigation was\nitself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.\nThis point is plain in Williams: We rejected any suggestion\nthat a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial\nstrategy—in that case, petitioner’s voluntary confession—\nwas “justified by a tactical decision” when “counsel did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant’s background.” 529 U. S., at 396. A\n“tactical decision” is a precursor to concluding that coun\nsel has developed a “reasonable” mitigation theory in a\nparticular case.10\n——————\n  10 Moreover, the reasonableness of the theory is not relevant when\nevaluating the impact of evidence that would have been available and\nlikely introduced, had counsel completed a constitutionally adequate\ninvestigation before settling on a particular mitigation theory. This\npoint was also plain in Williams: “Whether or not . . . omissions [in the\ninvestigation] were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome\nof sentencing,” they may nevertheless demonstrate deficiency. 529\nU. S., at 396. The one inquiry, deficient mitigation investigation, is\n10                        SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to\napply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited\nthe prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which\nthere was only “little or no mitigation evidence” presented,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases\ninvolving such circumstances,11 and we have explained\nthat there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi\ndence “would barely have altered the sentencing profile\npresented” to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at\n700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in\nother cases in which counsel presented what could be\ndescribed as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory\nduring the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398\n(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most\nrecently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had\nattempted to blame his client’s bad acts on his drunken\nness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation\nevidence relating to his client’s heroic military service and\nsubstantial mental health difficulties that came to light\nonly during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at\n11–12). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but—\nbound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)—\nwe also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap\nplied Strickland’s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por\nter’s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   We certainly have never held that counsel’s effort to\npresent some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves\ntigation might have prejudiced the defendant. To the\ncontrary, we have consistently explained that the Strick\n——————\ndistinct from the second, whether there was prejudice as a result.\n  11See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 515–516 (2003); Strick\n\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 700 (1984).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 397–398. And, in Porter, we recently explained:\n                   \t\n     “To assess [the] probability [of a different outcome\n     under Strickland], we consider the totality of the\n     available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at\n     trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceed\n     ing—and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggrava\n     tion.” 558 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo\n     tation marks omitted; third alteration in original).\nThat same standard applies—and will necessarily require\na court to “speculate” as to the effect of the new evidence—\nregardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence\nwas presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it\nis exactly this kind of probing inquiry that JUSTICE SCALIA\nnow undertakes, post, at 4–8, and that the trial court\nfailed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper preju\ndice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective repre\nsentation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation\ninvestigation.\n\n——————\n   12 Whether it did so implicitly is far from apparent, notwithstanding\n\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion to the contrary. See post, at 3–4. The trial\ncourt stated that the record was “largely silent” on “what [evidence]\nwould have been shown if [additional mitigating evidence] had been\nsought.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 28B. This is a curious assertion in light\nof the 22 volumes of evidentiary hearing transcripts and submissions in\nthe record, which spell out the findings discussed above. It also un\ndermines any suggestion that the court did, in fact, do the reweighing\nJUSTICE SCALIA believes it undertook; it is plain the record is not\n“largely silent.” And it also undermines any suggestion that the court\nsimply discounted the value of the testimony; had it made any such\nfinding, the court could have easily stated, instead, that the record\nevidence was unpersuasive.\n12                    SEARS v.

See Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n11); Williams, supra, at 397–398; Strickland, supra, at\n694. It is for the state court—and not for either this Court\nor even JUSTICE SCALIA—to undertake this reweighing in\nthe first instance.\n  Accordingly, the petition for certiorari and the motion\nfor leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.

Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The Court concludes, ante, at 7–12, that the Superior\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in\napplying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the\nCourt today remands for the state court to do what it has\nalready done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti\ngation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have\npersuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen\ntence for this brutal rape-murder.\n   The state habeas court responsibly executed the first\nstep in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga\ntion of mitigation evidence by Sears’ trial counsel was\ndeficient performance. The issue here is the second step:\nwhether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court\ncorrectly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:\nThe defendant has the burden to establish “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 24B–25B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,\n694). “When applied to the sentencing phase of death\npenalty trials,” that means “a reasonable probability that,\nabsent [counsel’s] errors, the sentencer would have con\ncluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” App. to Pet. for\n2                      SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCert. 25B–26B.\n   The Court today concludes that there were two errors in\nthe application of that proper standard. First, it reasons\nthat the court erroneously “curtailed a more probing\nprejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the\nassumed reasonableness of counsel’s mitigation theory” at\ntrial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several\nlevels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as\nsume trial counsel’s mitigation theory was reasonable; it\nfound that it was. It said: “[A]lthough counsel failed to\ninvestigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable\nmitigation theory with evidence to support it.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen\npotential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of\nSears’ father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his\nfamily, see 7 Record 2025, 2051–2052; 8 id., at 2129,\n2291–2344, Sears’ trial counsel developed a mitigation\ntheory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid\nmiddle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely\nout of character; that he cooperated with police; and that\nsentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and\nfriends, see id., at 2124–2125; 19 id., at 4861–4862, 4916–\n4917, 4954–4955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap\nproach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including\nSears’ mother, four family friends, and his high school\nguidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6–7 (citing trial\ntranscript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha\nbeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory\n“might be reasonable, in the abstract,” as the Court puts\nit, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel “put forth\na reasonable theory with supporting evidence.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B.\n   The Court’s argument is also flawed because the habeas\ncourt’s reasonableness finding did not cause it to “curtai[l]”\nits prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could\n“obviate the need to analyze” whether pursuing a different\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The reasonableness finding merely meant that the\nprejudice determination had to be made by asking, not\nwhether the jury’s mind would probably have been\nchanged by hearing Sears’ new mitigation theory instead\nof hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether\nit would probably have been changed by substituting\nSears’ new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation\ntheory that was presented and rejected.1 After hearing all\nthe witnesses and other evidence Sears presented before\nit, the state court concluded that “it is just not possible to\nknow what effect a different mitigation theory would have\nhad.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).2\n   The second, “and more fundamenta[l],” legal error the\nCourt alleges, ante, at 10–11, is really encased within the\nfirst. The Court claims that the state habeas court “lim\nited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in\nwhich there was only ‘little or no mitigation evidence’\npresented.” Id., at 10 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B).\nThe court erred, we are told, by determining that “pre\nsent[ation of] some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether” Sears was prejudiced. Ibid. That is\nnot a fair reading of the opinion.

This terribly misreads the state court’s opinion. It did not say (as\nthe Court’s point assumes) that counsel’s using the mitigation theory\nthey did was reasonable; it said that the theory itself was reasonable,\nmaking it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded\nthe jury. This presents no conceivable “tension.”\n  2 On the fair reading we owe the state court, its opinion provides no\n\nbasis for inferring that it failed to “engag[e] with the evidence” and “did\nnot even conduct any real analysis.” Ante, at 8, n. 8.\n4                    SEARS v.

That is absolutely correct. This case is not like\nthe prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it\ncould readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory\nwould have made a much deeper impression on the jury\nthan the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any\ntheory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears’ trial counsel presented a\nreasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more\ndifficult—so difficult that Sears could not make the requi\nsite showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this\nparticular case, the court said:\n    “Although here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior\n    appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having\n    reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not\n    possible to know what effect a different mitigation\n    theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible\n    to know what effect it would have had on other ju\n    rors.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.\n   Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to\nits Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the\njudgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion\nitself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga\ntion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose\na life sentence instead of death.\n   The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu\nsion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into\nthe 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the\nevidence supporting Sears’ new mitigation theory—an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The\nreader might think the state habeas court’s conclusion\nhighly questionable from the Court’s account, which re\ncites as solid all the evidence supporting Sears’ new miti\ngation theory, see ante, at 3–7. It is far from solid. Some\nis likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under Georgia\nlaw, see Gissendaner v. State, 272 Ga. 704, 714, 532 S. E.\n2d 677, 688–689 (2000); Gulley v.

Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979)\n(per curiam), ante, at 6, n. 6, to suggest that this unreliable hearsay\nwould be admissible for sentencing purposes is entirely misplaced. In\nGreen, we held it violated constitutional due process to exclude testi\nmony regarding a co-conspirator’s confession that he alone committed\nthe capital murder with which the defendant was charged. Our holding\ndepended on “th[e] unique circumstances” of the case: the testimony to\nbe used at sentencing was “highly relevant” and “substantial[ly]”\nreliable as a statement against penal interest made to a close friend; it\nwas corroborated by “ample” evidence and was used by the State to\nobtain a conviction in a separate trial against the co-conspirator. 442\nU. S., at 97. Here there are no such circumstances. The testimony is\nuncorroborated second-hand reporting from self-interested witnesses\nthat is unreliable and therefore likely inadmissible.\n6                           SEARS v.

The seri\nous head injuries consisted of Sears’ hitting his head at a\nroller-skating rink sometime early in elementary school,\n1 Record 76; 2 id., at 225, running into an end table as a\nchild, 6 id., at 1651, and getting hit with a golf club some\ntime later in elementary school, 1 id., at 79; 2 id., at 225.4\n(The last of these major injuries might not have been\nintroduced anyway, since that would have provided the\nprosecution an opportunity to refute both the extent of the\ninjury and the mercy-worthiness of Sears, by introducing\ninto evidence Sears’ boast that when he was 11 or 12 he\n“beat the s*** out of” someone after he was hit on the head\nwith a golf club, 8 id., at 2195.) Likewise incredible was\nthe assertion that Demetrius “introduced Sears to a life of\ncrime,” ante, at 6. According to testimony on which the\nCourt relies, Demetrius would “never let [Sears] hang\naround” with him and his drug-dealing friends. 6 Record\n1685–1686.\n  A jury also would have discredited the psychiatric tes\ntimony of Dr. Strickland that “[f]rom an etiological stand\npoint . . .

And then there are the unfa\nvorable parts of Dr. Dudley’s testimony: Sears is a “narcis\nsis[t],” id., at 135, with a “grandiose” opinion of himself,\nid., at 98–99; 2 id., at 246. Dr. Dudley’s affidavit portrays\nSears as arrogant and self-centered, id., at 246, 247, and\nnotes what he termed Sears’ “fantastical” boasting of his\nfirst sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and\nhis other “innumerable sexual experiences,” 1 id., at 98–\n99, 100; 2 id., at 246–247. It is hard to see how it could be\nthought probable that Sears’ so-called “magical thinking,”\n1 id., at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see\nante, at 6–7. It seems to me more likely the jury would\nconclude that Sears’ “profoun[d] personality disorder,”\n1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who\nwould commit heinous crimes in the future.\n   And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so ut\nterly unlikely to affect a jury’s determination that this\nbrutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just\nplain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears’ father\n“was ‘verbally abusive,’ ” ante, at 3, resting on nothing\nmore than an art teacher’s recollection that Sears’ father\n“severely criticized” him—“and meant it”!—at a conference\nwith the principal concerning his son’s poor academic\nperformance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father\n“disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style\ndrills,” ante, at 3–4, which consisted of positively Von-\nSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water\nwhen he refused to get up for school, and making him run\nextra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the\nclaim that his mother’s “ ‘favorite word’ ”—actually three\nwords—to refer to her sons was scatological, ante, at 3\n(quoting 2 Record 265).\n   While the Court takes pain to describe all the elements\nof Sears’ new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it\ndoes not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of\n8                          SEARS v.

But the jury heard all about\nthem. See Sears v. State, 268 Ga. 759, 759–760, 493 S. E.\n2d 180, 182 (1997). They heard Sears’ confession that he\nkidnaped, raped, and murdered Gloria Wilbur, a 59-year\nold wife and mother. Sears, carrying a briefcase contain\ning various instruments of mayhem—brass knuckles,\nknives, and handcuffs—and his accomplice, Phillip Wil\nliams, were surveying a supermarket parking lot on a\nSunday evening in October 1990, looking for a car to steal\nto drive back home to Ohio from Georgia. As the victim\nwas putting her groceries in the trunk of her car, Sears\napproached, punched her in the face with his brass knuck\nles, shoved her into the car, and drove to pick up Williams.\nSears then handcuffed her and pulled her into the back\nseat as Williams drove. After they passed into Tennessee,\nSears raped her. Later in the evening, after they had\ncrossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car.\nSears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the\nside of the highway as she begged for her life. After\nthrowing her on the ground, he stabbed her in the neck.\nIn his confession he showed no regret or remorse for his\nheinous crimes.5\n   I do not know how anyone could disagree with the ha\nbeas court’s conclusion that it is impossible to say that\nsubstituting the “deprived-childhood-cum-brain-damage”\ndefense for the “good-middle-class-kid-who-made-a\nmistake” defense would probably have produced a differ\nent verdict. I respectfully dissent.\n\n——————\n  5 The jury also heard from several corrections officers who testified\n\nthat while Sears was incarcerated awaiting trial and sentencing, he\nracked up dozens of disciplinary infractions, including assaults on other\ninmates. “ ‘Predatory,’ ” “ ‘[i]ncorrigible,’ ” and incapable of reform was\nhow they described him. 10 id., at 2951–2957; 19 id., at 4868.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/149653/", "sha1": "add6201bb06d3a64f82d67c1dcd07f7c45635114", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-092", "time_retrieved": "2010-06-29T07:25:43"}
