STEPHEN UPTON, \n\n                   WARDEN \n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF GEORGIA\n\n              No. 09\u20138854. Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   According to an expert who testified during state post\nconviction relief, petitioner Demarcus A. Sears performs at\nor below the bottom first percentile in several measures of\ncognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this\nabnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain\ndamage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and\nalcohol abuse in his teens. But because\u2014in the words of\nthe state trial court\u2014his counsel conducted a penalty\nphase investigation that was \u201con its face . . . constitution\nally inadequate,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence\nrelating to Sears\u2019 cognitive impairments and childhood\ndifficulties was not brought to light at the time he was\nsentenced to death.\n   After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per\nformance under the framework we set forth in Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the state postconvic\ntion court found itself unable to assess whether counsel\u2019s\ninadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29B\u201330B. Because Sears\u2019 counsel\ndid present some mitigation evidence during Sears\u2019 pen\nalty phase\u2014but not the significant mitigation evidence a\nconstitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov\nered\u2014the state court determined it could not speculate as\nto what the effect of additional evidence would have been.\nId., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction\nrelief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.\n2                           SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n  For the reasons that follow, it is plain from the face of\nthe state court\u2019s opinion that it failed to apply the correct\nprejudice inquiry we have established for evaluating\nSears\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. We therefore grant the\npetition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and\nremand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.1\n                               I\n   In 1993, a Georgia jury convicted Sears of armed rob\nbery and kidnaping with bodily injury (which also resulted\nin death), a capital crime under state law. See Ga. Code\nAnn. \u00a716\u20135\u201340(d)(4) (2006).2 During the penalty phase of\nSears\u2019 capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describ\ning his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without\nincident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the\nfollowing lines: Sears came from a middle-class back\nground; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives;\nand a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate\nthe family. See Pet. for Cert. 6\u20137. Counsel\u2019s mitigation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although this is a state-court decision, it resolved a federal issue on\n\nexclusively federal-law grounds. We therefore have jurisdiction. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71257; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)\n(reviewing state postconviction decision raising Sixth Amendment\nquestion).\n  2 Sears was sentenced to death for the Kentucky murder of a woman\n\nwhom he and an accomplice kidnaped in Georgia. Under Georgia law,\na jury may \u201cimpose a death sentence for the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury on the ground that the offense of kidnapping with bodily\ninjury was committed while the offender was engaged in the commis\nsion of the capital felon[y] of murder . . . .\u201d Potts v. State, 261 Ga. 716,\n720, 410 S. E. 2d 89, 93 (1991). So long as \u201cthe murder . . . [is] suffi\nciently a part of the same criminal transaction,\u201d it may count as a\n\u201cstatutory aggravating circumstanc[e] of the offense of kidnapping with\nbodily injury.\u201d Ibid., 410 S. E. 2d, at 94. Sears has raised a categorical\nEighth Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of his death\nsentence for a kidnaping offense, which we decline to reach. And any\njurisdictional or constitutional issue with respect to Georgia\u2019s ability to\nexecute Sears for a murder occurring in Kentucky is not before us.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ntheory, it seems, was calculated to portray the adverse\nimpact of Sears\u2019 execution on his family and loved ones.\n20 Record 5181. But the strategy backfired. The prosecu\ntor ultimately used the evidence of Sears\u2019 purportedly\nstable and advantaged upbringing against him during the\nState\u2019s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told\nthe jury, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have a deprived child from an inner\ncity; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an\nearly age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every\nway, who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded\nhim.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting trial transcript; internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state\npostconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demon\nstrates that Sears was far from \u201cprivileged in every way.\u201d\nSears\u2019 home life, while filled with material comfort, was\nanything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abu\nsive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of\nDemetrius A. Sears), and divorced when Sears was young,\nExh. 22, id., at 1654 (Affidavit of Virginia Sears Graves);\nhe suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent\nmale cousin, Exh. 26, id., at 1681\u20131682; his mother\u2019s\n\u201cfavorite word for referring to her sons was \u2018little mother\nfuckers,\u2019 \u201d Exh. 3, 2 Record 265 (Affidavit of Richard G.\nDudley, Jr., MD); and his father was \u201cverbally abusive,\u201d\nExh. 37, 6 Record 1746\u20131747 (Affidavit of Carol Becci-\nYoungs),3 and disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In the particular instance recounted in this affidavit, Sears\u2019 art\n\nteacher stated that his father \u201cberate[d] [him] in front of\u201d the school\nprincipal and her during a parent-teacher conference. Exh. 37, 6 Record\n1746. The event was significant: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the way he bullied\nhim,\u201d the art teacher explained, \u201cMr. Sears was so verbally abusive and\nmade such a scene, that it made everyone in the room uncomfortable.\u201d\nIbid. The art teacher had \u201cnever been in a conference where a parent\nseverely criticized a child in the presence of his teachers and meant it,\nas Mr. Sears did.\u201d Id., at 1747.\n4                     SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmilitary-style drills, Exh. 3, 2 Record 263\u2013264; Exh. 19, 6\nRecord 1622 (Affidavit of Frank Sears); Exh. 22, id., at\n1651; Exh. 28, id., at 1694 (Affidavit of Kenneth Burns,\nSr.). Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial\nbehavior problems from a very young age. For example,\nSears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500\u2013\n501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua\ntion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508. By the time\nSears reached high school, he was \u201cdescribed as severely\nlearning disabled and as severely behaviorally handi\ncapped.\u201d Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 Record 174\u2013176 (Affidavit of\nTony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).\n   Environmental factors aside, and more significantly,\nevidence produced during the state postconviction relief\nprocess also revealed that Sears suffered \u201csignificant\nfrontal lobe abnormalities.\u201d Exh. 1, id., at 147. Two dif\nferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub\nstantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cproblems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,\u201d\nibid.\u2014as a result of several serious head injuries he suf\nfered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1\nRecord 37\u201340 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95\u201396\n(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his\nbrain damage, his scores on at least two standardized\nassessment tests placed him at or below the first percen\ntile in several categories of cognitive function, \u201cmaking\nhim among the most impaired individuals in the popula\ntion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses\nand conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.\u201d Exh. 1, 2\nRecord 148; see also 1 Record 37. The assessment also\nrevealed that Sears\u2019 \u201cability to organize his choices, assign\nthem relative weight and select among them in a deliber\nate way is grossly impaired.\u201d Exh. 1, 2 Record 149. From\nan etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears\u2019\n\u201chistory is replete with multiple head trauma, substance\nabuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected\u201d to\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 150; see also\n1 Record 44.\n   Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the\nsources relied upon by Sears\u2019 experts\u2014informal personal\naccounts, see post, at 5\u20137 (opinion of SCALIA, J.)\u2014it does\nnot undermine the well-credentialed expert\u2019s assessment,4\nbased on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing,\nand observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from\nsubstantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dis\nmally on several of the forensic tests administered to him\nto assess his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word\nInterference Test, which measures response inhibition, id.,\nat 36\u201337, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which\naccounts for age, education, and background) performed\nbetter than he did. Ibid. On the Trail-Making B test,\nwhich also measures frontal lobe functioning, id., at 37\u2013\n38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile.\nId., at 38. Based on these results, the expert\u2019s first-hand\nobservations, and an extensive review of Sears\u2019 personal\nhistory, the expert\u2019s opinion was unequivocal: There is\n\u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d that Sears has \u201cpro\nnounced frontal lobe pathology.\u201d5 Id., at 68.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Dr. Strickland, a psychologist, is the director of a mild head injury\n\nclinic and the Sports Concussion Institute at Centinella Freeman\nMedical Center in Los Angeles. 1 Record 30. He is an associate profes\nsor of psychiatry in residence at the University of California at Los\nAngeles and directs a memory disorder and cerebral palsy clinic for\nthat university\u2019s department of neuroscience. Id., at 30\u201331. The State\nhad no objection to his being tendered as an expert in neuropsychology.\nId., at 31.\n   5 During a colloquy with the court, Dr. Strickland further explained:\n\n   \u201cTHE COURT: But by taking some history of head injuries, coupled\nwith the results of the tests that you\u2019ve given, you can comfortably\nconclude that the results of the tests that you\u2019ve given were a conse\nquence of frontal lobe head injuries?\n   \u201cTHE WITNESS: Absolutely. And, moreover, Your Honor, the\npatient has a lesion on the front of his head, which is something I can\nobserve.\u201d Id., at 78.\n6                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n  Further, the fact that Sears\u2019 brother is a convicted drug\ndealer and user, and introduced Sears to a life of crime, 6\nRecord 1683\u20131686, actually would have been consistent\nwith a mitigation theory portraying Sears as an individual\nwith diminished judgment and reasoning skills, who may\nhave desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother\nwho had shut him out of his life. Post, at 6. And the fact\nthat some of such evidence may have been \u201chearsay\u201d does\nnot necessarily undermine its value\u2014or its admissibility\u2014\nfor penalty phase purposes.6 Post, at 5, n. 3.\n  Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation\nevidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsur\nprising, post, at 7, given that counsel\u2019s initial mitigation\ninvestigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent\ncounsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse\nevidence into a positive\u2014perhaps in support of a cognitive\ndeficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of\nSears\u2019 grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magi\ncal thinking, ibid., were features, in another well\ncredentialed expert\u2019s view,7 of a \u201cprofound personality\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 LikeGeorgia\u2019s \u201cnecessity exception\u201d to its hearsay rules, see Ga.\nCode Ann. \u00a724\u20133\u20131(b) (2006), we have also recognized that reliable\nhearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant\u2019s mitigation\ndefense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay\nrule. See Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (\u201cRe\ngardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia\u2019s\nhearsay rule, under the facts of this case its exclusion constituted a\nviolation of the Due Process Clause . . . . The excluded testimony was\nhighly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial\u201d);\nsee also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302 (1973) (\u201cIn these\ncircumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascer\ntainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied\nmechanistically to defeat the ends of justice\u201d). We take no view on\nwhether the evidence at issue would satisfy the considerations we set\nforth in Green, or would be otherwise admissible under Georgia law.\n   7 Dr. Dudley, a psychiatrist, completed his internship and residency\n\nat Northwestern University Medical Center, and has been board\ncertified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neu\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This evidence might not have\nmade Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well\nhave helped the jury understand Sears, and his horren\ndous acts\u2014especially in light of his purportedly stable\nupbringing.\n   Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation\ninvestigation, none of this evidence was known to Sears\u2019\ntrial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction\nrelief.\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the state postconviction trial court\nconcluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel\u2019s\npenalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688 (explaining that first\ninquiry when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness\nclaim is whether counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d). In its view, the\ncursory nature of counsel\u2019s investigation into mitigation\nevidence\u2014\u201climited to one day or less, talking to witnesses\nselected by [Sears\u2019] mother\u201d\u2014was \u201con its face . . . constitu\ntionally inadequate.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.\n   What is surprising, however, is the court\u2019s analysis\nregarding whether counsel\u2019s facially inadequate mitigation\ninvestigation prejudiced Sears. See Strickland, supra, at\n694. Although the court appears to have stated the proper\nprejudice standard,8 it did not correctly conceptualize how\nthat standard applies to the circumstances of this case.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrology for more than 35 years. 1 Record 91\u201392. The State also had no\nobjection to his being tendered as an expert in psychiatry. Id., at 93.\n  8 The court asked whether \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that the\n\noutcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had done\nmore investigation.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B\u201330B; see Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694 (\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d).\n8                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nBecause Sears\u2019 counsel did present some mitigation evi\ndence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that\n\u201c[t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where\nlittle or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a\nreasonable prediction of outcome can be made.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that \u201cit is impossi\nble to know what effect [a different mitigation theory]\nwould have had on [the jury].\u201d Ibid. \u201cBecause counsel put\nforth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,\u201d the\ncourt reasoned, \u201c[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of\nproving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the\noutcome at trial would have been different if a different\nmitigation theory had been advanced.\u201d9 Ibid.\n   There are two errors in the state court\u2019s analysis of\nSears\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed\na more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue\nreliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s miti\ngation theory. The court\u2019s determination that counsel had\nconducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investi\ngation, should have, at the very least, called into question\nthe reasonableness of this theory. Cf. Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (explaining that \u201ccounsel\u2019s fail\nure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evi\ndence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . because counsel had not \u2018fulfill[ed] their obli\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Channeling powers of telepathy, JUSTICE SCALIA asserts that what\n\nthe trial court actually decided in this case is that \u201cSears\u2019 trial counsel\npresented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult\u2014so\ndifficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing.\u201d Post, at 4.\nSuch a highly favorable reading of the trial court\u2019s analysis would be\nfar more convincing had the trial court engaged with the evidence as\nJUSTICE SCALIA does. But it offered no such analysis in its opinion;\nindeed, it appears the court did not even conduct any real analysis,\nexplaining that it was \u201cimpossible to know what effect\u201d the evidence\nmight have had on the jury.

Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 396 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the\npoint, that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract,\ndoes not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel\u2019s\nfailure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation\nbefore arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears.\nThe \u201creasonableness\u201d of counsel\u2019s theory was, at this stage\nin the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced\nby his counsel\u2019s failures, whether his haphazard choice\nwas reasonable or not.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA chides the Court for concluding that the\ntrial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel\u2019s\nmitigation theory was a reasonable one. Post, at 2. But\nour point is that any finding with respect to the reason\nableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized\u2014in this\ncase, family impact\u2014is in tension with the trial court\u2019s\nunambiguous finding that counsel\u2019s investigation was\nitself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.\nThis point is plain in Williams: We rejected any suggestion\nthat a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial\nstrategy\u2014in that case, petitioner\u2019s voluntary confession\u2014\nwas \u201cjustified by a tactical decision\u201d when \u201ccounsel did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d 529 U. S., at 396. A\n\u201ctactical decision\u201d is a precursor to concluding that coun\nsel has developed a \u201creasonable\u201d mitigation theory in a\nparticular case.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Moreover, the reasonableness of the theory is not relevant when\nevaluating the impact of evidence that would have been available and\nlikely introduced, had counsel completed a constitutionally adequate\ninvestigation before settling on a particular mitigation theory. This\npoint was also plain in Williams: \u201cWhether or not . . . omissions [in the\ninvestigation] were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome\nof sentencing,\u201d they may nevertheless demonstrate deficiency. 529\nU. S., at 396. The one inquiry, deficient mitigation investigation, is\n10                        SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to\napply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited\nthe prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which\nthere was only \u201clittle or no mitigation evidence\u201d presented,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases\ninvolving such circumstances,11 and we have explained\nthat there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi\ndence \u201cwould barely have altered the sentencing profile\npresented\u201d to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at\n700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in\nother cases in which counsel presented what could be\ndescribed as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory\nduring the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398\n(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most\nrecently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had\nattempted to blame his client\u2019s bad acts on his drunken\nness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation\nevidence relating to his client\u2019s heroic military service and\nsubstantial mental health difficulties that came to light\nonly during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at\n11\u201312). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but\u2014\nbound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014\nwe also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap\nplied Strickland\u2019s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por\nter\u2019s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   We certainly have never held that counsel\u2019s effort to\npresent some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves\ntigation might have prejudiced the defendant.

S., at 397\u2013398. And, in Porter, we recently explained:\n                   \t\n     \u201cTo assess [the] probability [of a different outcome\n     under Strickland], we consider the totality of the\n     available mitigation evidence\u2014both that adduced at\n     trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceed\n     ing\u2014and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggrava\n     tion.\u201d 558 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo\n     tation marks omitted; third alteration in original).\nThat same standard applies\u2014and will necessarily require\na court to \u201cspeculate\u201d as to the effect of the new evidence\u2014\nregardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence\nwas presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it\nis exactly this kind of probing inquiry that JUSTICE SCALIA\nnow undertakes, post, at 4\u20138, and that the trial court\nfailed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper preju\ndice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective repre\nsentation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation\ninvestigation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Whether it did so implicitly is far from apparent, notwithstanding\n\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion to the contrary. See post, at 3\u20134. The trial\ncourt stated that the record was \u201clargely silent\u201d on \u201cwhat [evidence]\nwould have been shown if [additional mitigating evidence] had been\nsought.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 28B. This is a curious assertion in light\nof the 22 volumes of evidentiary hearing transcripts and submissions in\nthe record, which spell out the findings discussed above. It also un\ndermines any suggestion that the court did, in fact, do the reweighing\nJUSTICE SCALIA believes it undertook; it is plain the record is not\n\u201clargely silent.\u201d And it also undermines any suggestion that the court\nsimply discounted the value of the testimony; had it made any such\nfinding, the court could have easily stated, instead, that the record\nevidence was unpersuasive.\n12                    SEARS v.

Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The Court concludes, ante, at 7\u201312, that the Superior\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in\napplying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the\nCourt today remands for the state court to do what it has\nalready done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti\ngation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have\npersuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen\ntence for this brutal rape-murder.\n   The state habeas court responsibly executed the first\nstep in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga\ntion of mitigation evidence by Sears\u2019 trial counsel was\ndeficient performance. The issue here is the second step:\nwhether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court\ncorrectly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:\nThe defendant has the burden to establish \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 24B\u201325B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,\n694). \u201cWhen applied to the sentencing phase of death\npenalty trials,\u201d that means \u201ca reasonable probability that,\nabsent [counsel\u2019s] errors, the sentencer would have con\ncluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201d App. to Pet. for\n2                      SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCert. 25B\u201326B.\n   The Court today concludes that there were two errors in\nthe application of that proper standard. First, it reasons\nthat the court erroneously \u201ccurtailed a more probing\nprejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the\nassumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s mitigation theory\u201d at\ntrial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several\nlevels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as\nsume trial counsel\u2019s mitigation theory was reasonable; it\nfound that it was. It said: \u201c[A]lthough counsel failed to\ninvestigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable\nmitigation theory with evidence to support it.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen\npotential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of\nSears\u2019 father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his\nfamily, see 7 Record 2025, 2051\u20132052; 8 id., at 2129,\n2291\u20132344, Sears\u2019 trial counsel developed a mitigation\ntheory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid\nmiddle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely\nout of character; that he cooperated with police; and that\nsentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and\nfriends, see id., at 2124\u20132125; 19 id., at 4861\u20134862, 4916\u2013\n4917, 4954\u20134955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap\nproach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including\nSears\u2019 mother, four family friends, and his high school\nguidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6\u20137 (citing trial\ntranscript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha\nbeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory\n\u201cmight be reasonable, in the abstract,\u201d as the Court puts\nit, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel \u201cput forth\na reasonable theory with supporting evidence.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B.\n   The Court\u2019s argument is also flawed because the habeas\ncourt\u2019s reasonableness finding did not cause it to \u201ccurtai[l]\u201d\nits prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could\n\u201cobviate the need to analyze\u201d whether pursuing a different\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The reasonableness finding merely meant that the\nprejudice determination had to be made by asking, not\nwhether the jury\u2019s mind would probably have been\nchanged by hearing Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory instead\nof hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether\nit would probably have been changed by substituting\nSears\u2019 new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation\ntheory that was presented and rejected.1 After hearing all\nthe witnesses and other evidence Sears presented before\nit, the state court concluded that \u201cit is just not possible to\nknow what effect a different mitigation theory would have\nhad.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).2\n   The second, \u201cand more fundamenta[l],\u201d legal error the\nCourt alleges, ante, at 10\u201311, is really encased within the\nfirst. The Court claims that the state habeas court \u201clim\nited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in\nwhich there was only \u2018little or no mitigation evidence\u2019\npresented.\u201d Id., at 10 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B).\nThe court erred, we are told, by determining that \u201cpre\nsent[ation of] some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether\u201d Sears was prejudiced. Ibid. That is\nnot a fair reading of the opinion. The state court did not\nhold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice when\never his counsel provided any mitigation evidence.\nRather, it stated that \u201c[t]his case cannot be fairly com\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court contends, ante, at 9, that there was a \u201ctension\u201d between\nthe state court\u2019s conclusion that the investigation was deficient and its\nconclusion that the mitigation theory presented to the jury was reason\nable. This terribly misreads the state court\u2019s opinion. It did not say (as\nthe Court\u2019s point assumes) that counsel\u2019s using the mitigation theory\nthey did was reasonable; it said that the theory itself was reasonable,\nmaking it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded\nthe jury. This presents no conceivable \u201ctension.\u201d\n  2 On the fair reading we owe the state court, its opinion provides no\n\nbasis for inferring that it failed to \u201cengag[e] with the evidence\u201d and \u201cdid\nnot even conduct any real analysis.\u201d Ante, at 8, n. 8.\n4                    SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is\npresented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome\ncan be made.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis\nadded). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like\nthe prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it\ncould readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory\nwould have made a much deeper impression on the jury\nthan the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any\ntheory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears\u2019 trial counsel presented a\nreasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more\ndifficult\u2014so difficult that Sears could not make the requi\nsite showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this\nparticular case, the court said:\n    \u201cAlthough here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior\n    appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having\n    reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not\n    possible to know what effect a different mitigation\n    theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible\n    to know what effect it would have had on other ju\n    rors.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.\n   Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to\nits Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the\njudgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion\nitself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga\ntion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose\na life sentence instead of death.\n   The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu\nsion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into\nthe 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the\nevidence supporting Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory\u2014an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The\nreader might think the state habeas court\u2019s conclusion\nhighly questionable from the Court\u2019s account, which re\ncites as solid all the evidence supporting Sears\u2019 new miti\ngation theory, see ante, at 3\u20137. It is far from solid. Some\nis likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under Georgia\nlaw, see Gissendaner v. State, 272 Ga. 704, 714, 532 S. E.\n2d 677, 688\u2013689 (2000); Gulley v.

No juror would have been\nimpressed by such a character witness.\n   Some of the evidence is incredible, such as the psychia\ntrist\u2019s assertion that Sears had \u201csubstantial deficits in\nmental cognition and reasoning . . . as a result of serious\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  Court\u2019s reliance on Green v.

In\nGreen, we held it violated constitutional due process to exclude testi\nmony regarding a co-conspirator\u2019s confession that he alone committed\nthe capital murder with which the defendant was charged. Our holding\ndepended on \u201cth[e] unique circumstances\u201d of the case: the testimony to\nbe used at sentencing was \u201chighly relevant\u201d and \u201csubstantial[ly]\u201d\nreliable as a statement against penal interest made to a close friend; it\nwas corroborated by \u201cample\u201d evidence and was used by the State to\nobtain a conviction in a separate trial against the co-conspirator. 442\nU. S., at 97. Here there are no such circumstances. The testimony is\nuncorroborated second-hand reporting from self-interested witnesses\nthat is unreliable and therefore likely inadmissible.\n6                           SEARS v.

Likewise incredible was\nthe assertion that Demetrius \u201cintroduced Sears to a life of\ncrime,\u201d ante, at 6.

And then there are the unfa\nvorable parts of Dr. Dudley\u2019s testimony: Sears is a \u201cnarcis\nsis[t],\u201d id., at 135, with a \u201cgrandiose\u201d opinion of himself,\nid., at 98\u201399; 2 id., at 246.

It is hard to see how it could be\nthought probable that Sears\u2019 so-called \u201cmagical thinking,\u201d\n1 id., at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see\nante, at 6\u20137. It seems to me more likely the jury would\nconclude that Sears\u2019 \u201cprofoun[d] personality disorder,\u201d\n1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who\nwould commit heinous crimes in the future.\n   And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so ut\nterly unlikely to affect a jury\u2019s determination that this\nbrutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just\nplain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears\u2019 father\n\u201cwas \u2018verbally abusive,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 3, resting on nothing\nmore than an art teacher\u2019s recollection that Sears\u2019 father\n\u201cseverely criticized\u201d him\u2014\u201cand meant it\u201d!\u2014at a conference\nwith the principal concerning his son\u2019s poor academic\nperformance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father\n\u201cdisciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style\ndrills,\u201d ante, at 3\u20134, which consisted of positively Von-\nSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water\nwhen he refused to get up for school, and making him run\nextra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the\nclaim that his mother\u2019s \u201c \u2018favorite word\u2019 \u201d\u2014actually three\nwords\u2014to refer to her sons was scatological, ante, at 3\n(quoting 2 Record 265).\n   While the Court takes pain to describe all the elements\nof Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it\ndoes not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of\n8                          SEARS v.

They heard Sears\u2019 confession that he\nkidnaped, raped, and murdered Gloria Wilbur, a 59-year\nold wife and mother. Sears, carrying a briefcase contain\ning various instruments of mayhem\u2014brass knuckles,\nknives, and handcuffs\u2014and his accomplice, Phillip Wil\nliams, were surveying a supermarket parking lot on a\nSunday evening in October 1990, looking for a car to steal\nto drive back home to Ohio from Georgia. As the victim\nwas putting her groceries in the trunk of her car, Sears\napproached, punched her in the face with his brass knuck\nles, shoved her into the car, and drove to pick up Williams.\nSears then handcuffed her and pulled her into the back\nseat as Williams drove. After they passed into Tennessee,\nSears raped her. Later in the evening, after they had\ncrossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car.\nSears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the\nside of the highway as she begged for her life.

Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   According to an expert who testified during state post\nconviction relief, petitioner Demarcus A. Sears performs at\nor below the bottom first percentile in several measures of\ncognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this\nabnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain\ndamage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and\nalcohol abuse in his teens. But because\u2014in the words of\nthe state trial court\u2014his counsel conducted a penalty\nphase investigation that was \u201con its face . . . constitution\nally inadequate,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence\nrelating to Sears\u2019 cognitive impairments and childhood\ndifficulties was not brought to light at the time he was\nsentenced to death.\n   After finding constitutionally deficient attorney per\nformance under the framework we set forth in Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the state postconvic\ntion court found itself unable to assess whether counsel\u2019s\ninadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29B\u201330B. Because Sears\u2019 counsel\ndid present some mitigation evidence during Sears\u2019 pen\nalty phase\u2014but not the significant mitigation evidence a\nconstitutionally adequate investigation would have uncov\nered\u2014the state court determined it could not speculate as\nto what the effect of additional evidence would have been.\nId., at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction\nrelief. Id., at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia summarily denied review of his claims. Id., at 1A.\n2                           SEARS v.

We therefore grant the\npetition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and\nremand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.1\n                               I\n   In 1993, a Georgia jury convicted Sears of armed rob\nbery and kidnaping with bodily injury (which also resulted\nin death), a capital crime under state law. See Ga. Code\nAnn. \u00a716\u20135\u201340(d)(4) (2006).2 During the penalty phase of\nSears\u2019 capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describ\ning his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without\nincident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the\nfollowing lines: Sears came from a middle-class back\nground; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives;\nand a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate\nthe family. See Pet. for Cert. 6\u20137.

But the strategy backfired. The prosecu\ntor ultimately used the evidence of Sears\u2019 purportedly\nstable and advantaged upbringing against him during the\nState\u2019s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told\nthe jury, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have a deprived child from an inner\ncity; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an\nearly age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every\nway, who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded\nhim.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting trial transcript; internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state\npostconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demon\nstrates that Sears was far from \u201cprivileged in every way.\u201d\nSears\u2019 home life, while filled with material comfort, was\nanything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abu\nsive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of\nDemetrius A.

The event was significant: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the way he bullied\nhim,\u201d the art teacher explained, \u201cMr. Sears was so verbally abusive and\nmade such a scene, that it made everyone in the room uncomfortable.\u201d\nIbid.

Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial\nbehavior problems from a very young age. For example,\nSears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 Record 500\u2013\n501, and was referred to a local health center for evalua\ntion at age nine, Exh. 7, id., at 503, 504, 508.

Two dif\nferent psychological experts testified that Sears had sub\nstantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cproblems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,\u201d\nibid.\u2014as a result of several serious head injuries he suf\nfered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1\nRecord 37\u201340 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); id., at 95\u201396\n(Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his\nbrain damage, his scores on at least two standardized\nassessment tests placed him at or below the first percen\ntile in several categories of cognitive function, \u201cmaking\nhim among the most impaired individuals in the popula\ntion in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses\nand conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.\u201d Exh. 1, 2\nRecord 148; see also 1 Record 37.

Id., at 150; see also\n1 Record 44.\n   Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the\nsources relied upon by Sears\u2019 experts\u2014informal personal\naccounts, see post, at 5\u20137 (opinion of SCALIA, J.)\u2014it does\nnot undermine the well-credentialed expert\u2019s assessment,4\nbased on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing,\nand observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from\nsubstantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dis\nmally on several of the forensic tests administered to him\nto assess his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word\nInterference Test, which measures response inhibition, id.,\nat 36\u201337, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which\naccounts for age, education, and background) performed\nbetter than he did. Ibid. On the Trail-Making B test,\nwhich also measures frontal lobe functioning, id., at 37\u2013\n38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile.\nId., at 38. Based on these results, the expert\u2019s first-hand\nobservations, and an extensive review of Sears\u2019 personal\nhistory, the expert\u2019s opinion was unequivocal: There is\n\u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d that Sears has \u201cpro\nnounced frontal lobe pathology.\u201d5 Id., at 68.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Dr. Strickland, a psychologist, is the director of a mild head injury\n\nclinic and the Sports Concussion Institute at Centinella Freeman\nMedical Center in Los Angeles. 1 Record 30.

UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n  Further, the fact that Sears\u2019 brother is a convicted drug\ndealer and user, and introduced Sears to a life of crime, 6\nRecord 1683\u20131686, actually would have been consistent\nwith a mitigation theory portraying Sears as an individual\nwith diminished judgment and reasoning skills, who may\nhave desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother\nwho had shut him out of his life. Post, at 6. And the fact\nthat some of such evidence may have been \u201chearsay\u201d does\nnot necessarily undermine its value\u2014or its admissibility\u2014\nfor penalty phase purposes.6 Post, at 5, n. 3.\n  Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation\nevidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsur\nprising, post, at 7, given that counsel\u2019s initial mitigation\ninvestigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent\ncounsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse\nevidence into a positive\u2014perhaps in support of a cognitive\ndeficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of\nSears\u2019 grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magi\ncal thinking, ibid., were features, in another well\ncredentialed expert\u2019s view,7 of a \u201cprofound personality\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 LikeGeorgia\u2019s \u201cnecessity exception\u201d to its hearsay rules, see Ga.\nCode Ann. \u00a724\u20133\u20131(b) (2006), we have also recognized that reliable\nhearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant\u2019s mitigation\ndefense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay\nrule. See Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (\u201cRe\ngardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia\u2019s\nhearsay rule, under the facts of this case its exclusion constituted a\nviolation of the Due Process Clause . . . . The excluded testimony was\nhighly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial\u201d);\nsee also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302 (1973) (\u201cIn these\ncircumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascer\ntainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied\nmechanistically to defeat the ends of justice\u201d). We take no view on\nwhether the evidence at issue would satisfy the considerations we set\nforth in Green, or would be otherwise admissible under Georgia law.\n   7 Dr. Dudley, a psychiatrist, completed his internship and residency\n\nat Northwestern University Medical Center, and has been board\ncertified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neu\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This evidence might not have\nmade Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well\nhave helped the jury understand Sears, and his horren\ndous acts\u2014especially in light of his purportedly stable\nupbringing.\n   Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation\ninvestigation, none of this evidence was known to Sears\u2019\ntrial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction\nrelief.\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the state postconviction trial court\nconcluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel\u2019s\npenalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688 (explaining that first\ninquiry when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness\nclaim is whether counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d). In its view, the\ncursory nature of counsel\u2019s investigation into mitigation\nevidence\u2014\u201climited to one day or less, talking to witnesses\nselected by [Sears\u2019] mother\u201d\u2014was \u201con its face . . . constitu\ntionally inadequate.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.\n   What is surprising, however, is the court\u2019s analysis\nregarding whether counsel\u2019s facially inadequate mitigation\ninvestigation prejudiced Sears. See Strickland, supra, at\n694. Although the court appears to have stated the proper\nprejudice standard,8 it did not correctly conceptualize how\nthat standard applies to the circumstances of this case.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrology for more than 35 years. 1 Record 91\u201392. The State also had no\nobjection to his being tendered as an expert in psychiatry. Id., at 93.\n  8 The court asked whether \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that the\n\noutcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had done\nmore investigation.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B\u201330B; see Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694 (\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d).\n8                          SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nBecause Sears\u2019 counsel did present some mitigation evi\ndence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that\n\u201c[t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where\nlittle or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a\nreasonable prediction of outcome can be made.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that \u201cit is impossi\nble to know what effect [a different mitigation theory]\nwould have had on [the jury].\u201d Ibid. \u201cBecause counsel put\nforth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,\u201d the\ncourt reasoned, \u201c[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of\nproving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the\noutcome at trial would have been different if a different\nmitigation theory had been advanced.\u201d9 Ibid.\n   There are two errors in the state court\u2019s analysis of\nSears\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed\na more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue\nreliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s miti\ngation theory. The court\u2019s determination that counsel had\nconducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investi\ngation, should have, at the very least, called into question\nthe reasonableness of this theory. Cf. Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (explaining that \u201ccounsel\u2019s fail\nure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evi\ndence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . because counsel had not \u2018fulfill[ed] their obli\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Channeling powers of telepathy, JUSTICE SCALIA asserts that what\n\nthe trial court actually decided in this case is that \u201cSears\u2019 trial counsel\npresented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult\u2014so\ndifficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing.\u201d Post, at 4.\nSuch a highly favorable reading of the trial court\u2019s analysis would be\nfar more convincing had the trial court engaged with the evidence as\nJUSTICE SCALIA does. But it offered no such analysis in its opinion;\nindeed, it appears the court did not even conduct any real analysis,\nexplaining that it was \u201cimpossible to know what effect\u201d the evidence\nmight have had on the jury.

Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 396 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the\npoint, that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract,\ndoes not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel\u2019s\nfailure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation\nbefore arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears.\nThe \u201creasonableness\u201d of counsel\u2019s theory was, at this stage\nin the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced\nby his counsel\u2019s failures, whether his haphazard choice\nwas reasonable or not.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA chides the Court for concluding that the\ntrial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel\u2019s\nmitigation theory was a reasonable one. Post, at 2. But\nour point is that any finding with respect to the reason\nableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized\u2014in this\ncase, family impact\u2014is in tension with the trial court\u2019s\nunambiguous finding that counsel\u2019s investigation was\nitself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.\nThis point is plain in Williams: We rejected any suggestion\nthat a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial\nstrategy\u2014in that case, petitioner\u2019s voluntary confession\u2014\nwas \u201cjustified by a tactical decision\u201d when \u201ccounsel did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d 529 U. S., at 396. A\n\u201ctactical decision\u201d is a precursor to concluding that coun\nsel has developed a \u201creasonable\u201d mitigation theory in a\nparticular case.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Moreover, the reasonableness of the theory is not relevant when\nevaluating the impact of evidence that would have been available and\nlikely introduced, had counsel completed a constitutionally adequate\ninvestigation before settling on a particular mitigation theory. This\npoint was also plain in Williams: \u201cWhether or not . . . omissions [in the\ninvestigation] were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome\nof sentencing,\u201d they may nevertheless demonstrate deficiency. 529\nU.

UPTON\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to\napply the proper prejudice inquiry. We have never limited\nthe prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which\nthere was only \u201clittle or no mitigation evidence\u201d presented,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases\ninvolving such circumstances,11 and we have explained\nthat there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evi\ndence \u201cwould barely have altered the sentencing profile\npresented\u201d to the decisionmaker, Strickland, supra, at\n700. But we also have found deficiency and prejudice in\nother cases in which counsel presented what could be\ndescribed as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory\nduring the penalty phase. E.g., Williams, supra, at 398\n(remorse and cooperation with police); Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U. S. 374, 378 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most\nrecently in Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 3), where counsel at trial had\nattempted to blame his client\u2019s bad acts on his drunken\nness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation\nevidence relating to his client\u2019s heroic military service and\nsubstantial mental health difficulties that came to light\nonly during postconviction relief, id., at ___ (slip op., at\n11\u201312). Not only did we find prejudice in Porter, but\u2014\nbound by deference owed under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014\nwe also concluded the state court had unreasonably ap\nplied Strickland\u2019s prejudice prong when it analyzed Por\nter\u2019s claim. Porter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   We certainly have never held that counsel\u2019s effort to\npresent some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation inves\ntigation might have prejudiced the defendant.

S., at 397\u2013398. And, in Porter, we recently explained:\n                   \t\n     \u201cTo assess [the] probability [of a different outcome\n     under Strickland], we consider the totality of the\n     available mitigation evidence\u2014both that adduced at\n     trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceed\n     ing\u2014and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggrava\n     tion.\u201d 558 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 11) (internal quo\n     tation marks omitted; third alteration in original).\nThat same standard applies\u2014and will necessarily require\na court to \u201cspeculate\u201d as to the effect of the new evidence\u2014\nregardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence\nwas presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it\nis exactly this kind of probing inquiry that JUSTICE SCALIA\nnow undertakes, post, at 4\u20138, and that the trial court\nfailed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper preju\ndice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective repre\nsentation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation\ninvestigation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Whether it did so implicitly is far from apparent, notwithstanding\n\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion to the contrary. See post, at 3\u20134. The trial\ncourt stated that the record was \u201clargely silent\u201d on \u201cwhat [evidence]\nwould have been shown if [additional mitigating evidence] had been\nsought.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 28B. This is a curious assertion in light\nof the 22 volumes of evidentiary hearing transcripts and submissions in\nthe record, which spell out the findings discussed above. It also un\ndermines any suggestion that the court did, in fact, do the reweighing\nJUSTICE SCALIA believes it undertook; it is plain the record is not\n\u201clargely silent.\u201d And it also undermines any suggestion that the court\nsimply discounted the value of the testimony; had it made any such\nfinding, the court could have easily stated, instead, that the record\nevidence was unpersuasive.\n12                    SEARS v.

Decided June 29, 2010 \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The Court concludes, ante, at 7\u201312, that the Superior\nCourt of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in\napplying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the\nCourt today remands for the state court to do what it has\nalready done: find no reasonable likelihood that the miti\ngation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have\npersuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sen\ntence for this brutal rape-murder.\n   The state habeas court responsibly executed the first\nstep in the Strickland analysis, finding that the investiga\ntion of mitigation evidence by Sears\u2019 trial counsel was\ndeficient performance. The issue here is the second step:\nwhether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 7, the state habeas court\ncorrectly stated the prejudice standard under Strickland:\nThe defendant has the burden to establish \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 24B\u201325B (citing 466 U. S., at 688,\n694). \u201cWhen applied to the sentencing phase of death\npenalty trials,\u201d that means \u201ca reasonable probability that,\nabsent [counsel\u2019s] errors, the sentencer would have con\ncluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201d App. to Pet. for\n2                      SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCert. 25B\u201326B.\n   The Court today concludes that there were two errors in\nthe application of that proper standard. First, it reasons\nthat the court erroneously \u201ccurtailed a more probing\nprejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the\nassumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s mitigation theory\u201d at\ntrial. Ante, at 8. That argument is flawed on several\nlevels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not as\nsume trial counsel\u2019s mitigation theory was reasonable; it\nfound that it was. It said: \u201c[A]lthough counsel failed to\ninvestigate thoroughly, they did develop a reasonable\nmitigation theory with evidence to support it.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen\npotential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of\nSears\u2019 father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his\nfamily, see 7 Record 2025, 2051\u20132052; 8 id., at 2129,\n2291\u20132344, Sears\u2019 trial counsel developed a mitigation\ntheory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid\nmiddle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely\nout of character; that he cooperated with police; and that\nsentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and\nfriends, see id., at 2124\u20132125; 19 id., at 4861\u20134862, 4916\u2013\n4917, 4954\u20134955; 20 id., at 5181. To support that ap\nproach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including\nSears\u2019 mother, four family friends, and his high school\nguidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6\u20137 (citing trial\ntranscript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state ha\nbeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory\n\u201cmight be reasonable, in the abstract,\u201d as the Court puts\nit, ante, at 8. Rather, it concluded that counsel \u201cput forth\na reasonable theory with supporting evidence.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30B.\n   The Court\u2019s argument is also flawed because the habeas\ncourt\u2019s reasonableness finding did not cause it to \u201ccurtai[l]\u201d\nits prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could\n\u201cobviate the need to analyze\u201d whether pursuing a different\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The reasonableness finding merely meant that the\nprejudice determination had to be made by asking, not\nwhether the jury\u2019s mind would probably have been\nchanged by hearing Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory instead\nof hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether\nit would probably have been changed by substituting\nSears\u2019 new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation\ntheory that was presented and rejected.1 After hearing all\nthe witnesses and other evidence Sears presented before\nit, the state court concluded that \u201cit is just not possible to\nknow what effect a different mitigation theory would have\nhad.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).2\n   The second, \u201cand more fundamenta[l],\u201d legal error the\nCourt alleges, ante, at 10\u201311, is really encased within the\nfirst. The Court claims that the state habeas court \u201clim\nited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in\nwhich there was only \u2018little or no mitigation evidence\u2019\npresented.\u201d Id., at 10 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B).\nThe court erred, we are told, by determining that \u201cpre\nsent[ation of] some mitigation evidence should foreclose an\ninquiry into whether\u201d Sears was prejudiced. Ibid. That is\nnot a fair reading of the opinion. The state court did not\nhold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice when\never his counsel provided any mitigation evidence.\nRather, it stated that \u201c[t]his case cannot be fairly com\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court contends, ante, at 9, that there was a \u201ctension\u201d between\nthe state court\u2019s conclusion that the investigation was deficient and its\nconclusion that the mitigation theory presented to the jury was reason\nable. This terribly misreads the state court\u2019s opinion. It did not say (as\nthe Court\u2019s point assumes) that counsel\u2019s using the mitigation theory\nthey did was reasonable; it said that the theory itself was reasonable,\nmaking it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded\nthe jury. This presents no conceivable \u201ctension.\u201d\n  2 On the fair reading we owe the state court, its opinion provides no\n\nbasis for inferring that it failed to \u201cengag[e] with the evidence\u201d and \u201cdid\nnot even conduct any real analysis.\u201d Ante, at 8, n. 8.\n4                    SEARS v. UPTON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is\npresented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome\ncan be made.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis\nadded). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like\nthe prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it\ncould readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory\nwould have made a much deeper impression on the jury\nthan the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any\ntheory) offered at trial. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12); Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U. S. 510, 515, 537 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 369 (2000). Sears\u2019 trial counsel presented a\nreasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence suffi\ncient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more\ndifficult\u2014so difficult that Sears could not make the requi\nsite showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this\nparticular case, the court said:\n    \u201cAlthough here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior\n    appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having\n    reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not\n    possible to know what effect a different mitigation\n    theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible\n    to know what effect it would have had on other ju\n    rors.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.\n   Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to\nits Strickland conclusion, the only basis for reversing the\njudgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion\nitself: that Sears had not established that his new mitiga\ntion theory would probably have caused the jury to impose\na life sentence instead of death.\n   The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclu\nsion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into\nthe 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the\nevidence supporting Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory\u2014an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Later in the evening, after they had\ncrossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car.\nSears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the\nside of the highway as she begged for her life. After\nthrowing her on the ground, he stabbed her in the neck.\nIn his confession he showed no regret or remorse for his\nheinous crimes.5\n   I do not know how anyone could disagree with the ha\nbeas court\u2019s conclusion that it is impossible to say that\nsubstituting the \u201cdeprived-childhood-cum-brain-damage\u201d\ndefense for the \u201cgood-middle-class-kid-who-made-a\nmistake\u201d defense would probably have produced a differ\nent verdict. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The jury also heard from several corrections officers who testified\n\nthat while Sears was incarcerated awaiting trial and sentencing, he\nracked up dozens of disciplinary infractions, including assaults on other\ninmates. \u201c \u2018Predatory,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[i]ncorrigible,\u2019 \u201d and incapable of reform was\nhow they described him. 10 id., at 2951\u20132957; 19 id., at 4868.\n</pre>",
