CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, \n\n                      ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131521. Argued March 2, 2010\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this\n Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep\n and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a Dis\n trict of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the\n home. Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chi\n cago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by\n almost all private citizens. After Heller, petitioners filed this federal\n suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related ac\n tions, alleging that the City\u2019s handgun ban has left them vulnerable\n to criminals. They sought a declaration that the ban and several re\n lated City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amend\n ments. Rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument that the ordinances are un\n constitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously\n had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had\n explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment\n applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow estab\n lished Circuit precedent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on\n three 19th-century cases\u2014United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542,\n Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535\u2014\n which were decided in the wake of this Court\u2019s interpretation of the\n Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause in the\n Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n567 F. 3d 856, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, II\u2013A, II\u2013B, II\u2013D, III\u2013A, and III\u2013B, concluding that the Four\n2                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    teenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, rec\n    ognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self\n    defense. Pp. 5\u20139, 11\u201319, 19\u201333.\n       (a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions. Primarily, they\n    argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privi\n    leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\n    the Slaughter-House Cases\u2019 narrow interpretation of the Clause\n    should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, they contend that\n    the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the\n    Second Amendment right. Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respon\n    dents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to\n    the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any \u201c \u2018civi\n    lized\u2019 \u201d legal system. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country\n    that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that\n    right is not protected by due process. And since there are civilized\n    countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of hand\n    guns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such meas\n    ures. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally\n    applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g.,\n    Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the\n    constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War\u2019s aftermath\n    fundamentally altered the federal system. Four years after the adop\n    tion of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-\n    House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\n    those rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government,\n    its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,\u201d 16 Wall., at 79,\n    and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Fed\n    eral Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76. Under\n    this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause protects only very limited rights. Id., at 79\u201380. Subse\n    quently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to\n    the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116\n    U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Sev\n    enth Circuit relied in this case. Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms\n    applies to the States is considered in light of the Court\u2019s precedents\n    applying the Bill of Rights\u2019 protections to the States. Pp. 11\u201319.\n          (1) In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due\n    Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights pro\n    tections. See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516. Five fea\n    tures of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted. First,\n    the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from\n    the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncitizenship. See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99. Second, the\nCourt explained that the only rights due process protected against\nstate infringement were those \u201cof such a nature that they are in\ncluded in the conception of due process of law.\u201d Ibid. Third, some\ncases during this era \u201ccan be seen as having asked . . . if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the particular pro\ntection\u201d asserted therein. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149,\nn. 14. Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights\nguarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection,\nfinding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v.\nNew York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283\nU. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hur\ntado, supra. Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within\nthe conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded\nagainst state infringement sometimes differed from those provided\nagainst abridgment by the Federal Government. Pp. 11\u201313.\n     (2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of\nRights\u2019 provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 71\u2013\n72 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that the\nory. Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by\nJustice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by\nwhich the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights con\ntained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U. S. 335, 341. These decisions abandoned three of the charac\nteristics of the earlier period. The Court clarified that the governing\nstandard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is funda\nmental to our Nation\u2019s particular scheme of ordered liberty and sys\ntem of justice. Duncan, supra, at 149, n. 14. The Court eventually\nheld that almost all of the Bill of Rights\u2019 guarantees met the re\nquirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\nalso held that Bill of Rights protections must \u201call . . . be enforced\nagainst the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to\nthe same standards that protect those personal rights against federal\nencroachment.\u201d Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10. Under this ap\nproach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular\nBill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.\nSee, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S.\n455. Pp. 15\u201319.\n   (d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States. Pp. 19\u201333.\n     (1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to\nthe Nation\u2019s scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391\n4                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether\n    it is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washing\n    ton v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. Heller points unmistakably to\n    the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal\n    systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held\n    that individual self-defense is \u201cthe central component\u201d of the Second\n    Amendment right. 554 U. S., at ___, ___. Explaining that \u201cthe need\n    for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\u201d in the home,\n    ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because\n    they are \u201cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to \u2018keep\u2019 and use\n    for protection of one\u2019s home and family,\u201d id., at ___, ___\u2013___. It thus\n    concluded that citizens must be permitted \u201cto use [handguns] for the\n    core lawful purpose of self-defense.\u201d Id., at ___. Heller also clarifies\n    that this right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradi\n    tions,\u201d Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Heller explored the right\u2019s origins\n    in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was re\n    garded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of\n    the Bill of Rights. This is powerful evidence that the right was re\n    garded as fundamental in the sense relevant here. That understand\n    ing persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights\u2019\n    ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era,\n    which protected the right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 19\u201322.\n         (2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates\n    clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Framers and ratifiers\n    counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental\n    rights necessary to the Nation\u2019s system of ordered liberty. Pp. 22\u201333.\n            (i) By the 1850\u2019s, the fear that the National Government would\n    disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep\n    and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense. Abolitionist au\n    thors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm \u201cFree-\n    Soilers\u201d in \u201cBloody Kansas,\u201d met with outrage that the constitutional\n    right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people. After\n    the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to\n    disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.\n    These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen\u2019s\n    Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the\n    right to keep and bear arms. Congress, however, ultimately deemed\n    these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth\n    Amendment. Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment\n    was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the\n    rights set out in the Civil Rights Act. See General Building Contrac\n    tors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389. In Congressional\n    debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the\n    39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndamental right deserving of protection. Evidence from the period\nimmediately following the Amendment\u2019s ratification confirms that\nthat right was considered fundamental. Pp. 22\u201331.\n        (ii) Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that\nMembers of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \u00a71 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule. But while \u00a71 does\ncontain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause,\nit can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit dis\ncrimination. If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second\nAmendment should be singled out for special\u2014and specially unfavor\nable\u2014treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion. The right to keep\nand bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a\nprohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in\nan evenhanded manner. Pp. 30\u201333.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded, in Parts II\u2013C, IV, and V, that the Four\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second\nAmendment right recognized in Heller. Pp. 10\u201311, 33\u201344.\n   (a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one\nof the \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d\nThere is no need to reconsider the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases because,\nfor many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether par\nticular rights are protected against state infringement under the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Pp. 10\u201311.\n   (b) Municipal respondents\u2019 remaining arguments are rejected be\ncause they are at war with Heller\u2019s central holding. In effect, they\nask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a\ndifferent body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights\nguarantees. Pp. 33\u201340.\n   (c) The dissents\u2019 objections are addressed and rejected. Pp. 41\u201344.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recog\nnized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable\nto the States. However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion\nthat is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second\nAmendment\u2019s text and history. The Court is correct in describing the\nSecond Amendment right as \u201cfundamental\u201d to the American scheme\nof ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and\n\u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and traditions,\u201d Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. But the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nDue Process Clause, which speaks only to \u201cprocess,\u201d cannot impose\nthe type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court\nasserts. Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable\n6                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship\n    recognized by \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter\n    alia: \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\n    privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In inter\n    preting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional\n    provisions are \u201c \u2018written to be understood by the voters.\u2019 \u201d Heller, 554\n    U. S., at ___. The objective of this inquiry is to discern what \u201cordi\n    nary citizens\u201d at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s ratification\n    would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause to mean. Ibid. A survey of contemporary legal authorities\n    plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the\n    Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the\n    right to keep and bear arms.

A City ordinance provides that \u201c[n]o person\nshall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the\nholder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.\u201d\nChicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a78\u201320\u2013040(a) (2009). The\nCode then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus\neffectively banning handgun possession by almost all\nprivate citizens who reside in the City. \u00a78\u201320\u2013050(c).\nLike Chicago, Oak Park makes it \u201cunlawful for any person\nto possess . . . any firearm,\u201d a term that includes \u201cpistols,\nrevolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as\nhandguns.\u201d Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u20131\n(2007), 27\u20131\u20131 (2009).\n   Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents\n\u201cfrom the loss of property and injury or death from fire\narms.\u201d See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the\nCity Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti\ntioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun\nban has left them vulnerable to criminals.

Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resi\ndent whose home has been targeted by burglars. \u201cIn Mrs.\nLawson\u2019s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago\nwould decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or\ndeath should she ever be threatened again in her home.\u201d3\nMcDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own\nhandguns that they store outside of the city limits, but\nthey would like to keep their handguns in their homes for\nprotection.

All three cases were assigned to the same\nDistrict Judge.\n  The District Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the\nChicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. See\nApp. 83\u201384; NRA, Inc. v. Oak Park, 617 F. Supp. 2d 752,\n754 (ND Ill. 2008). The court noted that the Seventh\nCircuit had \u201csquarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban\non handguns a quarter century ago,\u201d id., at 753 (citing\nQuilici v. Morton Grove, 695 F. 2d 261 (CA7 1982)), and\nthat Heller had explicitly refrained from \u201copin[ing] on the\nsubject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amend\nment,\u201d NRA, 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 754. The court observed\nthat a district judge has a \u201cduty to follow established\nprecedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is\nbeholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw\nmay point in a different direction.\u201d Id., at 753.\n  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th\ncentury cases\u2014United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542\n(1876), Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 (1886), and Miller\nv. Texas, 153 U.

The Seventh\nCircuit described the rationale of those cases as \u201cdefunct\u201d\nand recognized that they did not consider the question\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\nincorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms. NRA, Inc. v. Chicago, 567 F. 3d 856, 857, 858\n(2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it\nwas obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that\nhave \u201cdirect application,\u201d and it declined to predict how\nthe Second Amendment would fare under this Court\u2019s\nmodern \u201cselective incorporation\u201d approach.

As a secon\ndary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cincorporates\u201d the\nSecond Amendment right.\n  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main\ntain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the\nStates only if that right is an indispensable attribute of\nany \u201c \u2018civilized\u2019 \u201d legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon\ndents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that\ndoes not recognize the right, the municipal respondents\ntell us, then that right is not protected by due process.\nIbid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or\nstrictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the\nmunicipal respondents maintain that due process does not\npreclude such measures. Id., at 21\u201323. In light of the\nparties\u2019 far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting\nthis Court\u2019s analysis over the years of the relationship\nbetween the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.\n                             B\n   The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,\noriginally applied only to the Federal Government. In\nBarron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243\n(1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall,\nexplained that this question was \u201cof great importance\u201d but\n\u201cnot of much difficulty.\u201d Id., at 247. In less than four\npages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the\nfirst eight Amendments operate as limitations on the\n6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, holding that they apply only to the Federal Gov\nernment. See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet.\n469, 551\u2013552 (1833) (\u201c[I]t is now settled that those amend\nments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states\u201d).\n   The constitutional Amendments adopted in the after\nmath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country\u2019s\nfederal system. The provision at issue in this case, \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other\nthings, that a State may not abridge \u201cthe privileges or\nimmunities of citizens of the United States\u201d or deprive\n\u201cany person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc\ness of law.\u201d\n   Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, this Court was asked to interpret the\nAmendment\u2019s reference to \u201cthe privileges or immunities of\ncitizens of the United States.\u201d The Slaughter-House\nCases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per\nmitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the\nbutchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.\nJustice Samuel Miller\u2019s opinion for the Court concluded\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\nthose rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal\ngovernment, its National character, its Constitution, or its\nlaws.\u201d Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental\nrights\u2014rights that predated the creation of the Federal\nGovernment and that \u201cthe State governments were cre\nated to establish and secure\u201d\u2014were not protected by the\nClause. Id., at 76.\n   In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of\nfederal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two\nprincipal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\nClause spoke of \u201cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States,\u201d and the Court contrasted this phrasing\nwith the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5\n(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con\ntrary reading would \u201cradically chang[e] the whole theory\nof the relations of the State and Federal governments to\neach other and of both these governments to the people,\u201d\nand the Court refused to conclude that such a change had\nbeen made \u201cin the absence of language which expresses\nsuch a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.\u201d Id., at 78.\nFinding the phrase \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States\u201d lacking by this high standard, the\nCourt reasoned that the phrase must mean something\nmore limited.\n  Under the Court\u2019s narrow reading, the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause protects such things as the right\n     \u201cto come to the seat of government to assert any claim\n     [a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans\n     act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro\n     tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering\n     its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State\n     of the Union by a bon\u00e2 fide residence therein, with the\n     same rights as other citizens of that State.\u201d Id., at\n     79\u201380 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Finding no constitutional protection against state intru\nsion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the\nCourt upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus\ntice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices\nSwayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes \u201c[a]ll per\n\nsons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris\ndiction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein\nthey reside.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause\nof Article IV provides that \u201c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)\n8                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClause to \u201ca vain and idle enactment, which accomplished\nnothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the\npeople on its passage.\u201d Id., at 96; see also id., at 104.\nJustice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause protects rights that are \u201cin their nature . . . funda\nmental,\u201d including the right of every man to pursue his\nprofession without the imposition of unequal or discrimi\nnatory restrictions. Id., at 96\u201397. Justice Bradley\u2019s dis\nsent observed that \u201cwe are not bound to resort to implica\ntion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the\nmost important privileges and immunities of citizens of\nthe United States. It is in the Constitution itself.\u201d Id., at\n118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated\nin the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.\nId., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority\u2019s nar\nrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as\n\u201cturn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.\u201d Id.,\nat 129 (dissenting opinion).\n   Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of\nthe narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,\nSaenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment\nagree \u201cthat the Clause does not mean what the Court said\nit meant in 1873\u201d); Amar, Substance and Method in the\nYear 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001)\n(\u201cVirtually no serious modern scholar\u2014left, right, and\ncenter\u2014thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible\nreading of the Amendment\u201d); Brief for Constitutional Law\nProfessors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an \u201coverwhelming\nconsensus among leading constitutional scholars\u201d that the\nopinion is \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d); C. Black, A New Birth of\nFreedom 74\u201375 (1997).\n   Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House\nCases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three\n19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In that case, the Court reviewed convictions\nstemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi\nana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many\nunarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white\nmen.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed\nAfrican-American prisoners through the streets and then\nhad them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were\nindicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine\nwent to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;\nthe remaining three were acquitted of murder but con\nvicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for\nbanding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of\nvarious constitutional rights, including the right to bear\narms.8\n    The Court reversed all of the convictions, including\nthose relating to the deprivation of the victims\u2019 right to\nbear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court\nwrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose\n\u201cis not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d and is not \u201cin\nany manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis\ntence.\u201d Id., at 553. \u201cThe second amendment,\u201d the Court\ncontinued, \u201cdeclares that it shall not be infringed; but this\n. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by\nCongress.\u201d Ibid. \u201cOur later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,\n116 U. S. 252, 265 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S.\n535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment\napplies only to the Federal Government.\u201d Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___, n. 23 (slip op., at 48, n. 23).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See C.

Rev. 2113, 2153 (1993).\n10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                              C\n   As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners\u2019\nclaims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,\nhowever, that we should overrule those decisions and hold\nthat the right to keep and bear arms is one of the \u201cprivi\nleges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In\npetitioners\u2019 view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprotects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as\nwell as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15\u201321,\nbut petitioners are unable to identify the Clause\u2019s full\nscope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 8\u201311. Nor is there any consen\nsus on that question among the scholars who agree that\nthe Slaughter-House Cases\u2019 interpretation is flawed. See\nSaenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.\nFor many decades, the question of the rights protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement\nhas been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that\nAmendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities\nClause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-\nHouse holding.\n   At the same time, however, this Court\u2019s decisions in\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from\nconsidering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right\nbinding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23\n(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases \u201cengage[d] in\nthe sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by\nour later cases.\u201d Ibid. As explained more fully below,\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in\nwhich the Court began the process of \u201cselective incorpo\nration\u201d under the Due Process Clause, and we have never\npreviously addressed the question whether the right to\nkeep and bear arms applies to the States under that\ntheory.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding\nthat other rights that were at issue in that case are bind\ning on the States through the Due Process Clause. In\nCruikshank, the Court held that the general \u201cright of the\npeople peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,\u201d which\nis protected by the First Amendment, applied only against\nthe Federal Government and not against the States. See\n92 U. S., at 551\u2013552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the\nCourt held that the right of peaceful assembly was a \u201cfun\ndamental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d De Jonge v. Oregon, 299\nU. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and\nthus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms\napplies to the States under the Due Process Clause.\n                              D\n                               1\n  In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider\nwhether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from\ninfringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado\nv. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not\nrequire grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.\nChicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits\nStates from taking of private property for public use with\nout just compensation). Five features of the approach\ntaken during the ensuing era should be noted.\n  First, the Court viewed the due process question as\nentirely separate from the question whether a right was a\nprivilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin\ning v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).\n  Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro\ntected against state infringement by the Due Process\nClause were those rights \u201cof such a nature that they are\nincluded in the conception of due process of law.\u201d Ibid.\nSee also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);\nBetts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297\nU. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).\nWhile it was \u201cpossible that some of the personal rights\nsafeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na\ntional action [might] also be safeguarded against state\naction,\u201d the Court stated, this was \u201cnot because those\nrights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.\u201d\nTwining, supra, at 99.\n   The Court used different formulations in describing the\nboundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the\nCourt referred to \u201cimmutable principles of justice which\ninhere in the very idea of free government which no mem\nber of the Union may disregard.\u201d 211 U. S., at 102 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu\nsetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights\nthat are \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d And in Palko, the\nCourt famously said that due process protects those rights\nthat are \u201cthe very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\u201d\nand essential to \u201ca fair and enlightened system of justice.\u201d\n302 U. S., at 325.\n   Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court\n\u201ccan be seen as having asked, when inquiring into\nwhether some particular procedural safeguard was re\nquired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined\nthat would not accord the particular protection.\u201d Duncan\nv. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in\nholding that due process prohibits a State from taking\nprivate property without just compensation, the Court\ndescribed the right as \u201ca principle of natural equity, rec\nognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from\na deep and universal sense of its justice.\u201d Chicago, B. &\nQ. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that\ndue process did not provide a right against compelled\nincrimination in part because this right \u201chas no place in\nthe jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe domain of the common law.\u201d Twining, supra, at 113.\n    Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to\nhold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to\nmeet the test for inclusion within the protection of the\nDue Process Clause. The Court found that some such\nrights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.\n652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.\nMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);\nPowell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De\nJonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con\nnecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).\nBut others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury\nindictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege\nagainst self-incrimination).\n    Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights\nwas held to fall within the conception of due process, the\nprotection or remedies afforded against state infringement\nsometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro\nvided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To\ngive one example, in Betts the Court held that, although\nthe Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun\nsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant\nwas unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause\nrequired appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed\nings only where \u201cwant of counsel in [the] particular case\n. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental\nfairness.\u201d 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo\nrado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the \u201ccore of\nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d was implicit in the concept of\nordered liberty and thus \u201cenforceable against the States\nthrough the Due Process Clause\u201d but that the exclusionary\nrule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the\nStates.

CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntween the Bill of Rights and \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held\nthat \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,\nAdamson, supra, at 71\u201372 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,\nsupra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black\nnoted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four\nteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend\nment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,\nin so doing, overruled this Court\u2019s decision in Barron.9\nAdamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee\n\non Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated\nthat the Amendment protected all of \u201cthe personal rights guarantied\nand secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.\u201d Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.\nGlobe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text\nof \u00a71, said that the Amendment would \u201carm the Congress . . . with the\npower to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution\ntoday.\u201d Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089\u20131090; A. Amar, The Bill of\nRights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill\nof Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained\nthe view that the rights guaranteed by \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment \u201care chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti\ntution of the United States.\u201d Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84\n(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader\nof the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that \u201cthe\nConstitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation\non the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con\ngress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe\n2459; see also M.

See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU. S. 335, 341 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.

J. 1509, 1600 (2007)).\nScholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, e.g.,\nFairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of\nRights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of\nRights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St.\nL. J. 435 (1981).\n  Proponents of the view that \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States re\nspond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used\ninterchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64\u201365, and that\nthe position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the\nAmendment was widely publicized and understood, see, e.g., Wilden\nthal, supra, at 1564\u20131565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understand\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866\u20131868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695 (2009). A number of scholars have\nfound support for the total incorporation of the Bill of Rights. See\nCurtis, supra, at 57\u2013130; Aynes, On Misreading John Bingham and the\nFourteenth Amendment, 103 Yale L. J. 57, 61 (1993); see also Amar,\nBill of Rights 181\u2013230.

S. 784, 794\n(1969).\n  The decisions during this time abandoned three of the\npreviously noted characteristics of the earlier period.11\nThe Court made it clear that the governing standard is not\nwhether any \u201ccivilized system [can] be imagined that\nwould not accord the particular protection.\u201d Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149, n. 14. Instead, the Court inquired whether a\nparticular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our\nscheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at\n149, and n. 14; see also id., at 148 (referring to those\n\u201cfundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at\nthe base of all our civil and political institutions\u201d (empha\nsis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights\nguaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for\nprotection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\neventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the\nBill of Rights.12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights pro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition\n\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause\npresent different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumer\nated rights, we have required that a right also be \u201cimplicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.\u201d See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  12 With respect to the First Amendment, see Everson v. Board of Ed.\n\nof Ewing, 330 U.

S. 38, 48\u201349 (1985).14\n  Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier\ndecisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani\nmous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a\nunanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,\n406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356\n(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the\nresult of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement\nof the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices\nagreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the\nFederal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395\n(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus\ntices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,\n406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the\nview that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in\nfederal and state criminal trials, id., at 414\u2013415 (Stewart, J., dissent\ning); Johnson, supra, at 381\u2013382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice\nPowell\u2019s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not\nstate, cases.     Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well\nestablished rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply\nidentically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,\nsupra, at 395\u2013396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (\u201cIn any\nevent, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court\nremains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of\nRights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial\nguarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application\nagainst both State and Federal Governments\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. 25);\nGideon, 372 U. S. 335 (overruling Betts, 316 U. S. 455);\nMalloy, supra (overruling Adamson, 332 U. S. 46, and\nTwining, 211 U. S. 78); Benton, supra, at 794 (overruling\nPalko, 302 U. S. 319).\n                            III\n  With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to\nthe question whether the Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due\nprocess. In answering that question, as just explained, we\nmust decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is\nfundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,\n391 U. S., at 149, or as we have said in a related context,\nwhether this right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s his\ntory and tradition,\u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.\n702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                 A\n   Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the an\nswer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many\nlegal systems from ancient times to the present day,15 and\nin Heller, we held that individual self-defense is \u201cthe\ncentral component\u201d of the Second Amendment right. 554\nU.

S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 19\u201320), and that\nby 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to\nkeep and bear arms was \u201cone of the fundamental rights of\nEnglishmen,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).\n   Blackstone\u2019s assessment was shared by the American\ncolonists. As we noted in Heller, King George III\u2019s attempt\nto disarm the colonists in the 1760\u2019s and 1770\u2019s \u201cprovoked\npolemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as\nEnglishmen to keep arms.\u201d16 Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21);\nsee also L.

Fed\neralists responded, not by arguing that the right was\ninsufficiently important to warrant protection but by\ncontending that the right was adequately protected by the\nConstitution\u2019s assignment of only limited powers to the\nFederal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25\u2013\n26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike\nagreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the\nnewly formed system of government. See Levy 143\u2013149;\nJ. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an\nAnglo-American Right 155\u2013164 (1994). But those who\nwere fearful that the new Federal Government would\ninfringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and\nbear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as\na condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327\u2013331 (2d ed.\n1854); 3 id., at 657\u2013661; 4 id., at 242\u2013246, 248\u2013249; see\nalso Levy 26\u201334; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American\nConstitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th\ned. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right\nwas regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.\n   This understanding persisted in the years immediately\nfollowing the ratification of the Bill of Rights. In addition\n22                MCDONALD v.

Founding-era\nlegal commentators confirmed the importance of the right\nto early Americans.

CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its\nefforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms\ndemonstrate that the right was still recognized to be\nfundamental.\n   The most explicit evidence of Congress\u2019 aim appears in\n\u00a714 of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided\nthat \u201cthe right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws\nand proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal\nsecurity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of\nestate, real and personal, including the constitutional\nright to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all\nthe citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previ\nous condition of slavery.\u201d 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (emphasis\nadded).22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that \u201call\nthe citizens,\u201d black and white, would have \u201cthe constitu\ntional right to bear arms.\u201d\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was\nconsidered at the same time as the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\nAct, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to\nkeep and bear arms.23 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncally interfered with.\u201d Joint Committee on Reconstruction, H. R. Rep.\nNo. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 140 (1866).\n   22 The Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bill was amended to include an express\n\nreference to the right to keep and bear arms, see 39th Cong. Globe 654\n(Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that\nthe unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at\n743 (Sen. Lyman Trumbull).\n   23 There can be do doubt that the principal proponents of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1866 meant to end the disarmament of African Americans\nin the South. In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its\npurpose as securing to blacks the \u201cprivileges which are essential to\nfreemen.\u201d Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described\nMississippi law that \u201cprohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having\nfire-arms\u201d and explained that the bill would \u201cdestroy\u201d such laws. Ibid.\nSimilarly, Representative Sidney Clarke cited disarmament of freed\nmen in Alabama and Mississippi as a reason to support the Civil Rights\nAct and to continue to deny Alabama and Mississippi representation in\nCongress: \u201cI regret, sir, that justice compels me to say, to the disgrace\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This language was vir\ntually identical to language in \u00a714 of the Freedmen\u2019s\nBureau Act, 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (\u201cthe right . . . to have full\nand equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning\npersonal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition,\nenjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d).\nAnd as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that\none of the \u201claws and proceedings concerning personal\nliberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment,\nand disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d was \u201cthe\nconstitutional right to bear arms.\u201d Ibid. Representative\nBingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the\nsame rights as enumerated in the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bill,\nwhich of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and\nbear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable\nconclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen\u2019s\nBureau Act, aimed to protect \u201cthe constitutional right to\nbear arms\u201d and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 264\u2013265 (noting that one of the\n\u201ccore purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the\nFourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances\u201d of\nfreedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to\n\u201caffirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self\ndefense\u201d).\n   Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof the Federal Government, that the \u2018reconstructed\u2019 State authorities of\nMississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers and\narm the rebels fresh from the field of treasonable strife. Sir, the dis\narmed loyalists of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana are powerless\nto-day, and oppressed by the pardoned and encouraged rebels of those\nStates. They appeal to the American Congress for protection. In\nresponse to this appeal I shall vote for every just measure of protection,\nfor I do not intend to be among the treacherous violators of the solemn\npledge of the nation.\u201d Id., at 1838\u20131839.\n28                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nremedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential\nvetoes, and this Court\u2019s pre-Civil-War precedent per\nsuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was\nnecessary to provide full protection for the rights of\nblacks.24 Today, it is generally accepted that the Four\nteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitu\ntional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil\nRights Act of 1866. See General Building Contractors\nAssn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389 (1982); see\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi, Two Cheers for\nProfessor Balkin\u2019s Originalism, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663,\n669\u2013670 (2009).\n   In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Con\ngress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a\nfundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Sam\nuel Pomeroy described three \u201cindispensable\u201d \u201csafeguards\nof liberty under our form of Government.\u201d 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1182. One of these, he said, was the right to keep\nand bear arms:\n       \u201cEvery man . . . should have the right to bear arms\n     for the defense of himself and family and his home\n     stead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken\n     open and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as\n     were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded\n     musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the pol\n     luted wretch to another world, where his wretched\n     ness will forever remain complete.\u201d Ibid.\nEven those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment\nunnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, \u201chave equal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   24 For example, at least one southern court had held the Civil Rights\n\nAct to be unconstitutional. That court did so, moreover, in the course of\nupholding the conviction of an African-American man for violating\nMississippi\u2019s law against firearm possession by freedmen.

In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament\nof freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the\nnecessity of the right: \u201cDisarm a community and you rob\nthem of the means of defending life. Take away their\nweapons of defense and you take away the inalienable\nright of defending liberty.\u201d \u201cThe fourteenth amendment,\nnow so happily adopted, settles the whole question.\u201d\nCong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to\nthe right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued\ndisarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,\nFreedmen 120\u2013131. Finally, legal commentators from the\nperiod emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.\nSee, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the\nUnited States of America \u00a7118, p. 145 (1867) (reprint\n1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional\nLaw of the United States \u00a7239, pp. 152\u2013153 (3d ed. 1875).\n  The right to keep and bear arms was also widely pro\ntected by state constitutions at the time when the Four\nteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    25 Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the\n\nright to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures. In speaking\ngenerally on reconstruction, Representative Roswell Hart listed the\n\u201c \u2018right of the people to keep and bear arms\u2019 \u201d as among those rights\nnecessary to a \u201crepublican form of government.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe\n1629. Similarly, in objecting to a bill designed to disarm southern\nmilitias, Senator Willard Saulsbury argued that such a measure would\nviolate the Second Amendment. Id., at 914\u2013915. Indeed, the bill\n\u201cultimately passed in a form that disbanded militias but maintained\nthe right of individuals to their private firearms.\u201d Cramer 858.\n30                     MCDONALD v.

What is\nmore, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruc\ntion era by former Confederate States included a right to\nkeep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, \u00a75\n(1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, \u00a715 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,\n\u00a713 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, there\nfore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being\namong the foundational rights necessary to our system of\nGovernment.27\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 More generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven\nother States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See\nCalabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52.\n  27 These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law\n\nenforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that\ndid not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not\npursue criminals beyond the town borders.

They argue\nthat Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment \u201cas an antidiscrimination\nrule,\u201d and they cite statements to the effect that the sec\ntion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.\nThis argument is implausible.\n   First, while \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains\n\u201can antidiscrimination rule,\u201d namely, the Equal Protection\nClause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that \u00a71\ndoes no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were\nso, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,\nwould not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the\nrights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the\nFourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not\nprohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only\ndiscriminatory searches and seizures\u2014and so on. We\nassume that this is not municipal respondents\u2019 view, so\nwhat they must mean is that the Second Amendment\nshould be singled out for special\u2014and specially unfavor\nable\u2014treatment. We reject that suggestion.\n   Second, municipal respondents\u2019 argument ignores the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n36, 42).\n32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclear terms of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which\nacknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If\nthat law had used language such as \u201cthe equal benefit of\nlaws concerning the bearing of arms,\u201d it would be possible\nto interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina\ntion. But \u00a714 speaks of and protects \u201cthe constitutional\nright to bear arms,\u201d an unmistakable reference to the\nright protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro\ntects the \u201cfull and equal benefit\u201d of this right in the States.\n14 Stat. 176\u2013177. It would have been nonsensical for\nCongress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a\nconstitutional right that does not exist.\n   Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those\nlaws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous\ncondition of servitude, African Americans in the South\nwould likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many\nof their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace\nofficers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,\na law banning the possession of guns by all private citi\nzens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for\nmal sense. Any such law\u2014like the Chicago and Oak Park\nordinances challenged here\u2014presumably would have\npermitted the possession of guns by those acting under the\nauthority of the State and would thus have left firearms in\nthe hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as\nthe Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction\nrevealed, see supra, at 24\u201325, those groups were widely\ninvolved in harassing blacks in the South.\n   Fourth, municipal respondents\u2019 purely antidiscrimina\ntion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the\nplight of whites in the South who opposed the Black\nCodes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had\nsimply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the\nbearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have\nbeen left without the means of self-defense\u2014as had aboli\ntionists in Kansas in the 1850\u2019s.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  Fifth, the 39th Congress\u2019 response to proposals to dis\nband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive.\nDespite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these\nmilitias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm\nthem. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,\nsupra, 20\u201321. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate\nthe members\u2019 right to bear arms, and it was ultimately\ndecided to disband the militias but not to disarm their\nmembers. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \u00a76, 14 Stat. 485, 487;\nHalbrook, Freedmen 68\u201369; Cramer 858\u2013861. It cannot\nbe doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a\nsubstantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded\nmanner.\n                             IV\n  Municipal respondents\u2019 remaining arguments are at war\nwith our central holding in Heller: that the Second\nAmendment protects a personal right to keep and bear\narms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense\nwithin the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us\nto treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class\nright, subject to an entirely different body of rules than\nthe other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be\nincorporated into the Due Process Clause.\n  Municipal respondents\u2019 main argument is nothing less\nthan a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece\ndent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by\ngone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due\nProcess Clause protects only those rights \u201c \u2018recognized by\nall temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and\nuniversal sense of [their] justice.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,\nat 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi\nble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not\nrecognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause\n34                     MCDONALD v.

Therefore, the municipal re\nspondents continue, because such countries as England,\nCanada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxem\nbourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit\nhandgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess\nsuch weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId., at 21\u201323.\n  This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the\nlong-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.\nSee Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14. And the pre\nsent-day implications of municipal respondents\u2019 argument\nare stunning. For example, many of the rights that our\nBill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal\noffenses are virtually unique to this country.28 If our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  28 For example, the United States affords criminal jury trials far more\nbroadly than other countries.

Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 10, n. 3. But even in this trimmed form,\nmunicipal respondents\u2019 argument flies in the face of more\nthan a half-century of precedent. For example, in Everson\nv. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 8 (1947), the Court\nheld that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment. Yet sev\neral of the countries that municipal respondents recognize\nas civilized have established state churches.29 If we were\nto adopt municipal respondents\u2019 theory, all of this Court\u2019s\nEstablishment Clause precedents involving actions taken\nby state and local governments would go by the boards.\n   Municipal respondents maintain that the Second\nAmendment differs from all of the other provisions of the\nBill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion rules).\n   29 England and Denmark have state churches.

Munici\npal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local\ngovernments to enact any gun control law that they deem\nto be reasonable, including a complete ban on the posses\nsion of handguns in the home for self-defense. Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 18\u201320, 23.\n   There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to\nrespect federalism and allow useful state experimentation,\na federal constitutional right should not be fully binding\non the States. This argument was made repeatedly and\neloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the\nconcept of incorporation and urged retention of the two\ntrack approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of\n\u201cselective incorporation,\u201d Justice Harlan in particular,\ninvoking the values of federalism and state experimenta\ntion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the\ntwo-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354\nU. S. 476, 500\u2013503 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result\nin part and dissenting in part); Mapp, supra, at 678\u2013680\n(Harlan, J., dissenting); Gideon, 372 U.

Florida, 399\nU. S. 78, 117 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and\nconcurring in result in part).\n   Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we\nturn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test\napplicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal\nrespondents\u2019 argument must be rejected. Under our prece\ndents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an\nAmerican perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels\n38                     MCDONALD v.

As noted by the 38 States that have appeared\nin this case as amici supporting petitioners, \u201c[s]tate and\nlocal experimentation with reasonable firearms regula\ntions will continue under the Second Amendment.\u201d Brief\nfor State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 23.\n   Municipal respondents and their amici complain that\nincorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to\nextensive and costly litigation, but this argument applies\nwith even greater force to constitutional rights and reme\ndies that have already been held to be binding on the\nStates. Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the\nexclusionary rule \u201cis not an individual right,\u201d Herring v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5), but a\n\u201cjudicially created rule,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), this\nCourt made the rule applicable to the States. See Mapp,\nsupra, at 660. The exclusionary rule is said to result in\n\u201ctens of thousands of contested suppression motions each\nyear.\u201d Stuntz, The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary\nRule, 20 Harv. J. Law & Pub.

See Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(indictment); Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211\n(1916) (civil jury).\n   As a result of Hurtado, most States do not require a grand jury\nindictment in all felony cases, and many have no grand juries.

See, e.g., Cheung v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 121 Nev. 867,\n124 P. 3d 550 (2005) (no right to jury trial in small claims court under\nNevada Constitution).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 23\u201331. In Heller, however, we\nexpressly rejected the argument that the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right should be determined by judicial\ninterest balancing, 554 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 62\u2013\n63), and this Court decades ago abandoned \u201cthe notion\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only\na watered-down, subjective version of the individual guar\nantees of the Bill of Rights,\u201d Malloy, supra, at 10\u201311 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not\nhistorically been understood to restrict the authority of the\nStates to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and\nsupporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms\nlaws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking\nabout their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining\nbans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller.\nMunicipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the\nlate 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See\nBrief for Municipal Respondents 26\u201327 (citing Kalodimos\nv. Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 470 N. E. 2d 266 (1984));\nsee also Reply Brief for Respondents NRA et al. 23, n. 7\n(asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete\nban on the possession of handguns). It is important to\nkeep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that\nprohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recog\nnized that the right to keep and bear arms is not \u201ca right\nto keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner\nwhatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d 554 U.

We repeat those assurances here.\nDespite municipal respondents\u2019 doomsday proclamations,\nincorporation does not imperil every law regulating\nfirearms.\n   Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to\nkeep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in\nthe first eight Amendments \u201cbecause the reason for codify\ning the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs\nfrom the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in\nself-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in\nthe concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Brief for Municipal Re\nspondents 36\u201337. Municipal respondents suggest that the\nSecond Amendment right differs from the rights hereto\nfore incorporated because the latter were \u201cvalued for\n[their] own sake.\u201d Id., at 33. But we have never previ\nously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on\nwhether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,\nand quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo\nrated\u2014for example the right to counsel and the right to\nconfront and subpoena witnesses\u2014are clearly instrumen\ntal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages\none of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,\nthat the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined\nby the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that\nright in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that\nthe codification of this right was prompted by fear that the\nFederal Government would disarm and thus disable the\nmilitias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was\nvalued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554\nU.

S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).\nThe question presented in this case, in his view, \u201cis\nwhether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap\nplies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment\nitself, standing on its own bottom.\u201d Post, at 27. He would\nhold that \u201c[t]he rights protected against state infringe\nment by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\nneed not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro\ntected against Federal Government infringement by the\nvarious provisions of the Bill of Rights.\u201d Post, at 9.\n   As we have explained, the Court, for the past half\ncentury, has moved away from the two-track approach. If\nwe were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 theory across the\nboard, decades of decisions would be undermined. We\nassume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged\ninstead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for\nthe individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous\ndissents.\n   The relationship between the Bill of Rights\u2019 guarantees\nand the States must be governed by a single, neutral\nprinciple. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren\nnan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as \u201cthe\nnotion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the\nStates only a watered-down, subjective version of the\nindividual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\u201d Malloy,\nsupra, at 10\u201311 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n42                MCDONALD v.

To begin, while there is certainly room\nfor disagreement about Heller\u2019s analysis of the history of\nthe right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since\nHeller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.\nFew other questions of original meaning have been as\nthoroughly explored.\n   JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s conclusion that the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the right to keep and\nbear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,\n\u201cthere is no popular consensus\u201d that the right is funda\nmental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi\nnorities or persons neglected by those holding political\npower, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second\nAmendment right would \u201camount to a significant incur\nsion on a traditional and important area of state concern,\naltering the constitutional relationship between the States\nand the Federal Government\u201d and preventing local varia\ntions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right in cases involving state and\nlocal laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical\nquestions regarding matters that are outside their area of\nexpertise, post, at 11\u201316. Even if we believed that these\nfactors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of\nthese factors undermines the case for incorporation of the\nright to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n   First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of\nRights applies to the States only if there is a \u201cpopular\nconsensus\u201d that the right is fundamental, and we see no\nbasis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,\nthere is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief\nsubmitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members\nof the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the\nright to keep and bear arms is fundamental.

Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.\n  Second, petitioners and many others who live in high\ncrime areas dispute the proposition that the Second\nAmendment right does not protect minorities and those\nlacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in\nhigh-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi\nnois legislators representing Chicago districts called on\nthe Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to\npatrol the City\u2019s streets.31 The legislators noted that the\nnumber of Chicago homicide victims during the current\nyear equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur\ning that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that\n80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting\nincorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend\nthat the right is especially important for women and\nmembers of other groups that may be especially vulner\nable to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their\nsafety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the\ncommunity would be enhanced by the possession of hand\nguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second\nAmendment right protects the rights of minorities and\nother residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not\nbeing met by elected public officials.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 See Mack & Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to\n\nChicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.\n  32 Janssen & Knowles, Send in Troops?

CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   Third, JUSTICE BREYER is correct that incorporation of\nthe Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the\nlegislative freedom of the States, but this is always true\nwhen a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorpora\ntion always restricts experimentation and local variations,\nbut that has not stopped the Court from incorporating\nvirtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. \u201c[T]he\nenshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes\ncertain policy choices off the table.\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable\nwith respect to the Second Amendment than it is with\nrespect to all the other limitations on state power found in\nthe Constitution.\n   Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation\nwill require judges to assess the costs and benefits of\nfirearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical\njudgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we\nhave noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an\ninterest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that\nsuggestion. See supra, at 38\u201339. \u201cThe very enumeration\nof the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even\nthe Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on\na case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth\ninsisting upon.\u201d Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62\u201363).\n                        *    *    *\n  In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects\nthe right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose\nof self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis\ncounsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that\nprotects a right that is fundamental from an American\nperspective applies equally to the Federal Government\nand the States. See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14.\nWe therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amend\nment right recognized in Heller.

Oliver, 510 U. S.\n266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring). This case does\nnot require me to reconsider that view, since straightfor\u00ad\nward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it.\n   I write separately only to respond to some aspects of\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 dissent. Not that aspect which dis\u00ad\nagrees with the majority\u2019s application of our precedents to\nthis case, which is fully covered by the Court\u2019s opinion.\nBut much of what JUSTICE STEVENS writes is a broad\ncondemnation of the theory of interpretation which under\u00ad\nlies the Court\u2019s opinion, a theory that makes the traditions\nof our people paramount. He proposes a different theory,\nwhich he claims is more \u201ccautiou[s]\u201d and respectful of\nproper limits on the judicial role. Post, at 57. It is that\nclaim I wish to address.\n                           I\n                           A\n  After stressing the substantive dimension of what he\n2                    MCDONALD v.

Connecticut, 302\nU. S. 319, 325 (1937), see post, at 14\u201320. But in fact he\ndoes not favor application of that theory at all. For\nwhether Palko requires only that \u201ca fair and enlightened\nsystem of justice would be impossible without\u201d the right\nsought to be incorporated, 302 U. S., at 325, or requires in\naddition that the right be rooted in the \u201ctraditions and\nconscience of our people,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted), many of the rights JUSTICE STEVENS thinks are\nincorporated could not pass muster under either test:\nabortion, post, at 7 (citing Planned Parenthood of South\neastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847 (1992)); homosex\u00ad\nual sodomy, post, at 16 (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.

S. 390, 399\u2013403 (1923)), among others.\n  That JUSTICE STEVENS is not applying any version of\nPalko is clear from comparing, on the one hand, the rights\nhe believes are covered, with, on the other hand, his con\u00ad\nclusion that the right to keep and bear arms is not cov\u00ad\nered. Rights that pass his test include not just those\n\u201crelating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family\nrelationships, and child rearing and education,\u201d but also\nrights against \u201c[g]overnment action that shocks the con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 I do not entirely understand JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 renaming of the Due\n\nProcess Clause. What we call it, of course, does not change what the\nClause says, but shorthand should not obscure what it says. Accepting\nfor argument\u2019s sake the shift in emphasis\u2014from avoiding certain\ndeprivations without that \u201cprocess\u201d which is \u201cdue,\u201d to avoiding the\ndeprivations themselves\u2014the Clause applies not just to deprivations of\n\u201cliberty,\u201d but also to deprivations of \u201clife\u201d and even \u201cproperty.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Not all\nsuch rights are in, however, since only \u201csome fundamental\naspects of personhood, dignity, and the like\u201d are protected,\npost, at 24 (emphasis added). Exactly what is covered is\nnot clear. But whatever else is in, he knows that the right\nto keep and bear arms is out, despite its being as \u201cdeeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), as a right can be, see District of\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.

I can find no\nother explanation for such certitude except that JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, despite his forswearing of \u201cpersonal and private\nnotions,\u201d post, at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted),\ndeeply believes it should be out.\n   The subjective nature of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 standard is\nalso apparent from his claim that it is the courts\u2019 preroga\u00ad\ntive\u2014indeed their duty\u2014to update the Due Process Clause\nso that it encompasses new freedoms the Framers were\ntoo narrow-minded to imagine, post, at 19\u201320, and n. 21.\nCourts, he proclaims, must \u201cdo justice to [the Clause\u2019s]\nurgent call and its open texture\u201d by exercising the \u201cinter\u00ad\npretive discretion the latter embodies.\u201d Post, at 21.

It is only we judges, exercising our\n\u201cown reasoned judgment,\u201d post, at 15, who can be en\u00ad\ntrusted with deciding the Due Process Clause\u2019s scope\u2014\nwhich rights serve the Amendment\u2019s \u201ccentral values,\u201d post,\nat 23\u2014which basically means picking the rights we want\nto protect and discarding those we do not.\n                              B\n   JUSTICE STEVENS resists this description, insisting that\nhis approach provides plenty of \u201cguideposts\u201d and \u201ccon\u00ad\nstraints\u201d to keep courts from \u201cinjecting excessive subjectiv\u00ad\nity\u201d into the process.3 Post, at 21. Plenty indeed\u2014and\nthat alone is a problem. The ability of omnidirectional\nguideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their\nnumber. But even individually, each lodestar or limitation\nhe lists either is incapable of restraining judicial whimsy\nor cannot be squared with the precedents he seeks to\npreserve.\n   He begins with a brief nod to history, post, at 21, but as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER is not worried by that prospect. His interpretive\n\napproach applied to incorporation of the Second Amendment includes\nconsideration of such factors as \u201cthe extent to which incorporation will\nfurther other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent\nto which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\ntural aims\u201d; whether recognizing a particular right will \u201cfurther the\nConstitution\u2019s effort to ensure that the government treats each individ\u00ad\nual with equal respect\u201d or will \u201chelp maintain the democratic form of\ngovernment\u201d; whether it is \u201cinconsistent . . . with the Constitution\u2019s\nefforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying\nout of its constitutional promises\u201d; whether it fits with \u201cthe Framers\u2019\nbasic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial\nreview\u201d; courts\u2019 comparative advantage in answering empirical ques\u00ad\ntions that may be involved in applying the right; and whether there is a\n\u201cstrong offsetting justification\u201d for removing a decision from the democ\u00ad\nratic process.

Moreover, trusting the meaning\nof the Due Process Clause to what has historically been\nprotected is circular, see post, at 19, since that would\nmean no new rights could get in.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS moves on to the \u201cmost basic\u201d con\u00ad\nstraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would\n\u201cesche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down,\ntotalizing theory of \u2018liberty.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22. The notion that\nthe absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause\nwill somehow curtail judicial caprice is at war with reason.\nIndeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose\nwhatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution.\nThe idea that interpretive pluralism would reduce courts\u2019\nability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not\nmerely na\u00efve, but absurd. If there are no right answers,\nthere are no wrong answers either.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that requiring courts to\nshow \u201crespect for the democratic process\u201d should serve as\na constraint. Post, at 23. That is true, but JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would have them show respect in an extraordi\u00ad\nnary manner. In his view, if a right \u201cis already being\ngiven careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing\ncalibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. In other words, a right, such as the\nright to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized\nbut on which the States are considering restrictions, ap\u00ad\nparently deserves less protection, while a privilege the\npolitical branches (instruments of the democratic process)\nhave withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves\nmore. That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accom\u00ad\nplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court\nheld protected in Casey, Lawrence, and other such cases fit\nthe theory\u2014but at the cost of insulting rather than re\u00ad\nspecting the democratic process.\n  The next constraint JUSTICE STEVENS suggests is harder\n6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nto evaluate. He describes as \u201can important tool for guiding\njudicial discretion\u201d \u201csensitivity to the interaction between\nthe intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of\ncontemporary society.\u201d Post, at 24. I cannot say whether\nthat sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no\nidea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges\nwhen they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges\nare more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic\nconflict between liberty and its potentially harmful conse\u00ad\nquences? Attempting to give the concept more precision,\nJUSTICE STEVENS explains that \u201csensitivity is an aspect of\na deeper principle: the need to approach our work with\nhumility and caution.\u201d Ibid. Both traits are undeniably\nadmirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is\na mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case\nJUSTICE STEVENS cites in support, see ibid., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful\nform of judicial modesty in mind.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS offers no examples to illustrate the\nnext constraint: stare decisis, post, at 25. But his view of it\nis surely not very confining, since he holds out as a \u201cca\u00ad\nnonical\u201d exemplar of the proper approach, see post, at 16,\n54, Lawrence, which overruled a case decided a mere 17\nyears earlier, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986),\nsee 539 U. S., at 578 (it \u201cwas not correct when it was\ndecided, and it is not correct today\u201d). Moreover, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would apply that constraint unevenly: He appar\u00ad\nently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot\u00ad\nfor-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal\ndefendants, post, at 11, but would abandon those Warren\nCourt rulings that undercut his approach to substantive\nrights, on the basis that we have \u201ccut back\u201d on cases from\nthat era before, post, at 12.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also relies on the requirement of a\n\u201ccareful description of the asserted fundamental liberty\ninterest\u201d to limit judicial discretion. Post, at 25 (internal\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nquotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that\nrequirement, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993),\nthough some cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have not\napplied it seriously, see, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 562\n(\u201cThe instant case involves liberty of the person both in its\nspatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\u201d). But if\nthe \u201ccareful description\u201d requirement is used in the man\u00ad\nner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of\ndetermining the Due Process Clause\u2019s \u201cconceptual core,\u201d\npost, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we\nsought a careful, specific description of the right at issue\nin order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly\ndefined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 722\u2013728; Reno, supra, at 302\u2013306; Collins v.\nHarker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125\u2013129 (1992); Cruzan v.\nDirector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.

The threshold step of defining the asserted right\nwith precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as\nJUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the \u201cconceptual core\u201d of the\n\u201cliberty clause,\u201d post, at 23, includes a number of capa\u00ad\ncious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define\nthe right with much precision in order to conclude that it\npertains to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cability independently to define\n[his] identity,\u201d his \u201cright to make certain unusually impor\u00ad\ntant decisions that will affect his own, or his family\u2019s,\ndestiny,\u201d or some aspect of his \u201c[s]elf-determination, bodily\nintegrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,\npolitical equality, dignity [or] respect.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there\u00ad\nfore have in mind some other use for the careful\u00ad\ndescription requirement\u2014perhaps just as a means of\nensuring that courts \u201cprocee[d] slowly and incrementally,\u201d\npost, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by\n8                      MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nhaving them draft their opinions in longhand.4\n                              II\n  If JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 account of the constraints of his\napproach did not demonstrate that they do not exist, his\napplication of that approach to the case before us leaves no\ndoubt. He offers several reasons for concluding that the\nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not\nfundamental enough to be applied against the States.5\nNone is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose,\neach is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude\nincorporation of rights we have already held incorporated,\nor both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a\njudge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 After\n          defending the careful-description criterion, JUSTICE STEVENS\nquickly retreats and cautions courts not to apply it too stringently.\nPost, at 26. Describing a right too specifically risks robbing it of its\n\u201cuniversal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have,\u201d ibid.,\nand \u201cloads the dice against its recognition,\u201d post, at 26, n. 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That must be avoided, since it endangers\nrights JUSTICE STEVENS does like. See ibid. (discussing Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003)). To make sure those rights get in, we must\nleave leeway in our description, so that a right that has not itself been\nrecognized as fundamental can ride the coattails of one that has been.\n  5 JUSTICE STEVENS claims that I mischaracterize his argument by\n\nreferring to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\ninstead of \u201cthe interest in keeping a firearm of one\u2019s choosing in the\nhome,\u201d the right he says petitioners assert. Post, at 38, n. 36. But it is\nprecisely the \u201cSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms\u201d that\npetitioners argue is incorporated by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,\nPet. for Cert. i. Under JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 own approach, that should end\nthe matter. See post, at 26 (\u201c[W]e must pay close attention to the\nprecise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate\u201d). In\nany event, the demise of watered-down incorporation, see ante, at 17\u2013\n19, means that we no longer subdivide Bill of Rights guarantees into\ntheir theoretical components, only some of which apply to the States.\nThe First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated\u2014not the\nfreedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\n\u201cfirearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship\nto liberty,\u201d since sometimes they are used to cause (or\nsometimes accidentally produce) injury to others. Post, at\n35. The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liber\u00ad\nties deserve Due Process protection is never explained\u2014\nproof that judges applying JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 approach can\nadd new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion,\nmoreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely JUSTICE\nSTEVENS does not mean that the Clause covers only rights\nthat have zero harmful effect on anyone. Otherwise even\nthe First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is\nthat the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a\nrisk to others\u2019 physical well-being. But as the plurality\nexplains, ante, at 35\u201336, other rights we have already held\nincorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public\nsafety. In all events, JUSTICE STEVENS supplies neither a\nstandard for how severe the impairment on others\u2019 liberty\nmust be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any\nmethod of measuring the severity.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next suggests that the Second\nAmendment right is not fundamental because it is \u201cdiffer\u00ad\nent in kind\u201d from other rights we have recognized. Post, at\n37. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear\narms is different from some other rights we have held the\nClause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply\ngrounded in our nation\u2019s history and tradition. But\nJUSTICE STEVENS has a different distinction in mind:\nEven though he does \u201cnot doubt for a moment that many\nAmericans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life\nas well as to their security,\u201d he pronounces that owning a\nhandgun is not \u201ccritical to leading a life of autonomy,\ndignity, or political equality.\u201d6 Post, at 37\u201338. Who says?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 JUSTICE STEVENS goes a step farther still, suggesting that the right\n\nto keep and bear arms is not protected by the \u201cliberty clause\u201d because it\nis not really a liberty at all, but a \u201cproperty right.\u201d Post, at 38. Never\n10                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDeciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled\nlife is an inherently political, moral judgment\u2014the an\u00ad\ntithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions\nby applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.7\n   No determination of what rights the Constitution of the\nUnited States covers would be complete, of course, without\na survey of what other countries do. Post, at 40\u201341. When\nit comes to guns, JUSTICE STEVENS explains, our Nation is\nalready an outlier among \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d; not\neven our \u201coldest allies\u201d protect as robust a right as we do,\nand we should not widen the gap. Ibid. Never mind that\nhe explains neither which countries qualify as \u201cadvanced\ndemocracies\u201d nor why others are irrelevant. For there is\nan even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges\npick which rights States must respect and those they can\nignore: As the plurality shows, ante, at 34\u201335, and nn. 28\u2013\n29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would fore\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; and\nnever mind that the \u201cliberty clause\u201d is really a Due Process Clause\nwhich explicitly protects \u201cproperty,\u201d see United States v. Carlton, 512\nU. S. 26, 41\u201342 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 theory cannot explain why the Takings Clause, which unques\u00ad\ntionably protects property, has been incorporated, see Chicago, B. & Q.\nR. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 241 (1897), in a decision he appears to\naccept, post, at 14, n. 14.\n   7 As JUSTICE STEVENS notes, see post, at 51\u201352, I accept as a matter of\n\nstare decisis the requirement that to be fundamental for purposes of the\nDue Process Clause, a right must be \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty,\u201d Lawrence, supra, at 593, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But that inquiry provides infinitely less\nscope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court\u2019s ap\u00ad\nproach, since the field of candidates is immensely narrowed by the prior\nrequirement that a right be rooted in this country\u2019s traditions. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that\nhe thinks \u201cimplicit in the concept, etc.\u201d The point JUSTICE STEVENS\nmakes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical\napproach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than\nhis in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so. See\nPart III, infra.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nclose rights that we have held (and JUSTICE STEVENS\naccepts) are incorporated, but that other \u201cadvanced\u201d na\u00ad\ntions do not recognize\u2014from the exclusionary rule to the\nEstablishment Clause.           A judge applying JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 approach must either throw all of those rights\noverboard or, as cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have\ndone in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore\nforeign law when it undermines the desired conclusion,\nsee, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (making no mention of\nforeign law).\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that since the right to\nkeep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of \u201cpre\u00ad\nvent[ing] elimination of the militia,\u201d it should be viewed as\n\u201c \u2018a federalism provision\u2019 \u201d logically incapable of incorpora\u00ad\ntion. Post, at 41\u201342 (quoting Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., con\u00ad\ncurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks\nomitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when\njudges want it to. The opinion JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nfor the \u201cfederalism provision\u201d principle, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\nconcurrence in Newdow, argued that incorporation of the\nEstablishment Clause \u201cmakes little sense\u201d because that\nClause was originally understood as a limit on congres\u00ad\nsional interference with state establishments of religion.\nId., at 49\u201351. JUSTICE STEVENS, of course, has no problem\nwith applying the Establishment Clause to the States.\nSee, e.g., id., at 8, n. 4 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS,\nJ.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause\n\u201cappl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment\u201d). While he insists that Clause is not a\n\u201cfederalism provision,\u201d post, at 42, n. 40, he does not ex\u00ad\nplain why it is not, but the right to keep and bear arms is\n(even though only the latter refers to a \u201cright of the peo\u00ad\nple\u201d). The \u201cfederalism\u201d argument prevents the incorpora\u00ad\ntion of only certain rights.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next argues that even if the right to\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nkeep and bear arms is \u201cdeeply rooted in some important\nsenses,\u201d the roots of States\u2019 efforts to regulate guns run\njust as deep. Post, at 44 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). But this too is true of other rights we have held\nincorporated. No fundamental right\u2014not even the First\nAmendment\u2014is absolute. The traditional restrictions go\nto show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental\ncharacter. At least that is what they show (JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would agree) for other rights. Once again, prin\u00ad\nciples are applied selectively.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 final reason for rejecting incorpora\u00ad\ntion of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than\nany of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that\nthere is a \u201cplausible constitutional basis\u201d for holding that\nthe right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts\nthat we ought not to do so for prudential reasons. Post, at\n47. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that\nare within the Constitution\u2019s command (and we assuredly\ndo not), two of the reasons JUSTICE STEVENS gives for\nabstention show just how much power he would hand to\njudges. The States\u2019 \u201cright to experiment\u201d with solutions to\nthe problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here\nbecause \u201cthe best solution is far from clear.\u201d Post, at 47\u2013\n48 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is true of\nmost serious social problems\u2014whether, for example, \u201cthe\nbest solution\u201d for rampant crime is to admit confessions\nunless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced,\nbut see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 444\u2013445\n(1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty\nwithout a requirement that they be free to consider \u201cany\nrelevant mitigating factor,\u201d see Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\nU. S. 104, 112 (1982), which in turn leads to the conclusion\nthat defense counsel has provided inadequate defense if he\nhas not conducted a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d into poten\u00ad\ntially mitigating factors, see, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S. 510, 534 (2003), inquiry into which question tends to\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. ___ (2009) (per curiam) (reversing\ngrant of habeas relief for sentencing on a crime committed\nin 1981). The obviousness of the optimal answer is in the\neye of the beholder. The implication of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019\ncall for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that\nThey The People\u2019s answers to a problem are silly, we are\nfree to \u201cinterven[e],\u201d post, at 47, but if we too are uncertain\nof the right answer, or merely think the States may be on\nto something, we can loosen the leash.\n   A second reason JUSTICE STEVENS says we should ab\u00ad\nstain is that the States have shown they are \u201ccapable\u201d of\nprotecting the right at issue, and if anything have pro\u00ad\ntected it too much. Post, at 49. That reflects an assump\u00ad\ntion that judges can distinguish between a proper democ\u00ad\nratic decision to leave things alone (which we should\nhonor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we\nshould step in to correct). I would not\u2014and no judge\nshould\u2014presume to have that sort of omniscience, which\nseems to me far more \u201carrogant,\u201d post, at 41, than confin\u00ad\ning courts\u2019 focus to our own national heritage.\n                              III\n   JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 response to this concurrence, post, at\n51\u201356, makes the usual rejoinder of \u201cliving Constitution\u201d\nadvocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to\neliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The\ntraditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes\ndiscretion in judges as well.8 Historical analysis can be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS also asserts that his approach is \u201cmore faithful to\nthis Nation\u2019s constitutional history\u201d and to \u201cthe values and commit\u00ad\nments of the American people, as they stand today,\u201d post, at 54. But\nwhat he asserts to be the proof of this is that his approach aligns (no\nsurprise) with those cases he approves (and dubs \u201ccanonical,\u201d ibid.).\nCases he disfavors are discarded as \u201chardly bind[ing]\u201d \u201cexcesses,\u201d post,\nat 12, or less \u201cenduring,\u201d post, at 17, n. 16. Not proven. Moreover,\nwhatever relevance JUSTICE STEVENS ascribes to current \u201cvalues and\n14                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ndifficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold ques\u00ad\ntions, and making nuanced judgments about which evi\u00ad\ndence to consult and how to interpret it.\n   I will stipulate to that.9 But the question to be decided\nis not whether the historically focused method is a perfect\nmeans of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution\u00ad\nwriting; but whether it is the best means available in an\nimperfect world. Or indeed, even more narrowly than\nthat: whether it is demonstrably much better than what\nJUSTICE STEVENS proposes. I think it beyond all serious\ndispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much\nless upon the democratic process. It is less subjective\nbecause it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of\nreasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico\u00ad\npolitical First Principles whose combined conclusion can\nbe found to point in any direction the judges favor. In the\nmost controversial matters brought before this Court\u2014for\nexample, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion,\nassisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitu\u00ad\ntionality of the death penalty\u2014any historical methodology,\nunder any plausible standard of proof, would lead to the\nsame conclusion.10 Moreover, the methodological differ\u00ad\nences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncommitments of the American people\u201d (and that is unclear, see post, at\n48\u201349, n. 47), it is hard to see how it shows fidelity to them that he\ndisapproves a different subset of old cases than the Court does.\n   9 That is not to say that every historical question on which there is\n\nroom for debate is indeterminate, or that every question on which\nhistorians disagree is equally balanced. Cf. post, at 52\u201353. For exam\u00ad\nple, the historical analysis of the principal dissent in Heller is as valid\nas the Court\u2019s only in a two-dimensional world that conflates length\nand depth.\n   10 By the way, JUSTICE STEVENS greatly magnifies the difficulty of an\n\nhistorical approach by suggesting that it was my burden in Lawrence to\nshow the \u201cancient roots of proscriptions against sodomy,\u201d post, at 53\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Au contraire, it was his burden (in\nthe opinion he joined) to show the ancient roots of the right of sodomy.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nassumptions they bring to their work, post, at 52\u201354, are\nnothing compared to the differences among the American\npeople (though perhaps not among graduates of prestig\u00ad\nious law schools) with regard to the moral judgments\nJUSTICE STEVENS would have courts pronounce. And\nwhether or not special expertise is needed to answer his\u00ad\ntorical questions, judges most certainly have no \u201ccompara\u00ad\ntive . . . advantage,\u201d post, at 24 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), in resolving moral disputes. What is more, his\napproach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard\nquestions courts must confront, since he would not replace\nhistory with moral philosophy, but would have courts\nconsider both.\n   And the Court\u2019s approach intrudes less upon the democ\u00ad\nratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those\nestablished by a constitutional history formed by democ\u00ad\nratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are\nleft to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,\nwith the assurance that their decision is not subject to\njudicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 approach, on the\nother hand, deprives the people of that power, since what\u00ad\never the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro\u00ad\ntected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After\nall, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at\n55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.\nJUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which \u201cmajorities or\npowerful interest groups always get their way,\u201d post, at 56,\nbut replaces it with a system in which unelected and life\u00ad\ntenured judges always get their way.

Id., at __ (slip op., at 64). The question in this case\nis whether the Constitution protects that right against\nabridgment by the States.\n   As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption in 1868, the an\nswer to that question would be simple. In Barron ex rel.\nTiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), this\nCourt held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Fed\neral Government. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice\nMarshall recalled that the founding generation added the\nfirst eight Amendments to the Constitution in response to\nAntifederalist concerns regarding the extent of federal\u2014\nnot state\u2014power, and held that if \u201cthe framers of these\namendments [had] intended them to be limitations on the\npowers of the state governments,\u201d \u201cthey would have de\nclared this purpose in plain and intelligible language.\u201d\nId., at 250.

Lincoln, Speech at Peoria, Ill. (Oct. 16,\n1854), reprinted in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham\nLincoln 266 (R. Basler ed. 1953) (\u201c[N]o man is good enough\nto govern another man, without that other\u2019s consent. I say\nthis is the leading principle\u2014the sheet anchor of American\nrepublicanism. . . . Now the relation of masters and slaves\nis, pro tanto, a total violation of this principle\u201d).\n   After the war, a series of constitutional amendments\nwere adopted to repair the Nation from the damage slav\nery had caused. The provision at issue here, \u00a71 of the\nFourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system\nof government. The first sentence of that section provides\nthat \u201c[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the\nUnited States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d This\nunambiguously overruled this Court\u2019s contrary holding in\nDred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), that the\nConstitution did not recognize black Americans as citizens\nof the United States or their own State. Id., at 405\u2013406.\n   The meaning of \u00a71\u2019s next sentence has divided this\nCourt for many years. That sentence begins with the\ncommand that \u201c[n]o State shall make or enforce any law\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citi\nzens of the United States.\u201d On its face, this appears to\ngrant the persons just made United States citizens a\ncertain collection of rights\u2014i.e., privileges or immunities\u2014\nattributable to that status.\n   This Court\u2019s precedents accept that point, but define the\nrelevant collection of rights quite narrowly.         In the\nSlaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), decided just\nfive years after the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the\n4                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely\ndivided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction be\ntween the privileges and immunities of state citizenship\nand those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter cate\ngory of rights from state abridgment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt defined that category to include only those rights\n\u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its\nNational character, its Constitution, or its laws.\u201d Id., at\n79. This arguably left open the possibility that certain\nindividual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be\nconsidered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.\nSee ibid. (listing \u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and\n\u201cthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d as rights poten\ntially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).\nBut the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly\nin its later cases.\n   Chief among those cases is United States v. Cruikshank,\n92 U. S. 542 (1876). There, the Court held that members\nof a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as\n165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse\nhad not deprived the victims of their privileges as Ameri\ncan citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear\narms. Ibid.; see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).\nAccording to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble\ncodified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of\nUnited States citizenship because \u201c[t]he right . . . existed\nlong before the adoption of the Constitution.\u201d 92 U. S., at\n551 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the\nright to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United\nStates citizenship because it was not \u201cin any manner\ndependent upon that instrument for its existence.\u201d Id., at\n553. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the\nright to bear arms in the Second Amendment\u2014its nature\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nas an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution\u2019s\nadoption\u2014was the very reason citizens could not enforce it\nagainst States through the Fourteenth.\n   That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court\u2019s\nlast word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.1 In the\nintervening years, the Court has held that the Clause\nprevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such\nas the right to travel, see Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 503\n(1999), that are not readily described as essential to\nliberty.\n   As a consequence of this Court\u2019s marginalization of the\nClause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental\nrights turned to the remainder of \u00a71 in search of an alter\nnative fount of such rights. They found one in a most\ncurious place\u2014that section\u2019s command that every State\nguarantee \u201cdue process\u201d to any person before depriving\nhim of \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d At first, litigants argued\nthat this Due Process Clause \u201cincorporated\u201d certain proce\ndural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the\nStates. The Court generally rejected those claims, how\never, on the theory that the rights in question were not\nsufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to warrant such treatment.\nSee, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v. Dow, 176\nU. S. 581 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); Twining v.\nNew Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908) (privilege against self\nincrimination).\n   That changed with time. The Court came to conclude\nthat certain Bill of Rights guarantees were sufficiently\nfundamental to fall within \u00a71\u2019s guarantee of \u201cdue process.\u201d\nThese included not only procedural protections listed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In the two decades after United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542\n\n(1876), was decided, this Court twice reaffirmed its holding that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause does not apply the Second Amendment\nto the States. Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 266\u2013267 (1886); Miller\nv. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894).\n6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe first eight Amendments, see, e.g., Benton v. Maryland,\n395 U. S. 784 (1969) (protection against double jeopardy),\nbut substantive rights as well, see, e.g., Gitlow v. New\nYork, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925) (right to free speech); Near\nv. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 707 (1931)\n(same). In the process of incorporating these rights\nagainst the States, the Court often applied them differ\nently against the States than against the Federal Gov\nernment on the theory that only those \u201cfundamental\u201d\naspects of the right required Due Process Clause protec\ntion. See, e.g., Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 473 (1942)\n(holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appoint\nment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the\ndefendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the\nDue Process Clause required appointment of counsel in\nstate criminal cases only where \u201cwant of counsel . . . re\nsult[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fair\nness\u201d). In more recent years, this Court has \u201cabandoned\nthe notion\u201d that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply\ndifferently when incorporated against the States than they\ndo when applied to the Federal Government. Ante, at 17\u2013\n18 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a\nright is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only\nif it is sufficiently \u201cfundamental,\u201d ante, at 37, 42\u201344 (plu\nrality opinion)\u2014a term the Court has long struggled to\ndefine.\n   While this Court has at times concluded that a right\ngains \u201cfundamental\u201d status only if it is essential to the\nAmerican \u201cscheme of ordered liberty\u201d or \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in\nthis Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 19 (plurality\nopinion) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court\nhas just as often held that a right warrants Due Process\nClause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range\nof criteria, see Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562\n(2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Using the latter approach, the\nCourt has determined that the Due Process Clause applies\nrights against the States that are not mentioned in the\nConstitution at all, even without seriously arguing that\nthe Clause was originally understood to protect such\nrights. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905);\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Lawrence, supra.\n   All of this is a legal fiction. The notion that a constitu\ntional provision that guarantees only \u201cprocess\u201d before a\nperson is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define\nthe substance of those rights strains credulity for even the\nmost casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a\nparticularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the\nCourt\u2019s substantive due process precedents together is\ntheir lack of a guiding principle to distinguish \u201cfundamen\ntal\u201d rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental\nrights that do not. Today\u2019s decision illustrates the point.\nReplaying a debate that has endured from the inception of\nthe Court\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, the\ndissents laud the \u201cflexibility\u201d in this Court\u2019s substantive\ndue process doctrine, post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);\nsee post, at 6\u20138 (BREYER, J., dissenting), while the plural\nity makes yet another effort to impose principled re\nstraints on its exercise, see ante, at 33\u201341. But neither\nside argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due\nProcess Clause was consistent with public understanding\nat the time of its ratification.\n   To be sure, the plurality\u2019s effort to cabin the exercise of\njudicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focus\ning its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American\nhistory and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse\nthan the alternatives. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissent\ning) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against\nthe States through the Due Process Clause if they are\n\u201cwell-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional prom\n8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nises\u201d); post, at 22 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (warning that\nthere is no \u201call-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n\u2018liberty\u2019 \u201d protected by the Due Process Clause). But any\nserious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause\nmust acknowledge that neither its text nor its history\nsuggests that it protects the many substantive rights this\nCourt\u2019s cases now claim it does.\n   I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation\nthat rests on such tenuous footing. This Court\u2019s substan\ntive due process framework fails to account for both the\ntext of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that\nled to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence\ndevoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original mean\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alter\nnative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this\nCourt to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is\ndesigned to protect with greater clarity and predictability\nthan the substantive due process framework has so far\nmanaged.\n   I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been\nbuilt upon the substantive due process framework, and I\nfurther acknowledge the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation\u2019s legal system. But stare decisis is\nonly an \u201cadjunct\u201d of our duty as judges to decide by our\nbest lights what the Constitution means. Planned Par\nenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.

Moreover, as judges, we\ninterpret the Constitution one case or controversy at a\ntime. The question presented in this case is not whether\nour entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be\npreserved or revised, but only whether, and to what ex\ntent, a particular clause in the Constitution protects the\nparticular right at issue here. With the inquiry appropri\nately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129\n(describing the \u201crights and liberties\u201d of Englishmen as\n\u201cprivate immunities\u201d and \u201ccivil privileges\u201d). A number of\nantebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this man\nner. See, e.g., Magill v. Brown, 16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No.\n8,952) (CC ED Pa. 1833) (Baldwin, J.)

In addition,\ndictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this\nunderstanding. See, e.g., N. Webster, An American Dic\ntionary of the English Language 1039 (C.

Black\nstone, for example, used the terms \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cim\nmunities\u201d to describe both the inalienable rights of indi\nviduals and the positive-law rights of corporations.

See 1\nB. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History\n8\u221216, 19\u221221, 41\u221246 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These\nfundamental rights, according to the English tradition,\nbelonged to all people but became legally enforceable only\nwhen recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parlia\nment and the decisions of common-law judges. See B.\nBailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolu\ntion 77\u221279 (1967). These rights included many that later\n12                     MCDONALD v.

See, e.g., 1 Annals\nof Cong. 431\u2212432, 436\u2013437, 440\u2013442 (1834) (statement of\nRep.

S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 19) (\u201c[I]t has always been widely understood that\nthe Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amend\nments, codified a pre-existing right\u201d). The Court\u2019s subse\nquent decision in Barron, however, made plain that the\ncodification of these rights in the Bill made them legally\nenforceable only against the Federal Government, not the\nStates. See 7 Pet., at 247.\n                              3\n   Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the\nStates, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state\ninterference with individual rights. Article IV, \u00a72, cl. 1\nprovides that \u201c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several\nStates.\u201d The text of this provision resembles the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that\nthe public\u2019s understanding of the latter was informed by\nits understanding of the former.\n   Article IV, \u00a72 was derived from a similar clause in the\nArticles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship\nthe Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing\nthat \u201cleague\u201d of separate sovereign States. Gibbons v.\nOgden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187 (1824); see 3 J. Story, Commentar\nies on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71800, p. 675\n(1833). By virtue of a person\u2019s citizenship in a particular\nState, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties\nthat State\u2019s constitution and laws made available. Article\nIV, \u00a72 vested citizens of each State with an additional\n16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nright: the assurance that they would be afforded the\n\u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of citizenship in any of the\nseveral States in the Union to which they might travel.\n   What were the \u201cPrivileges and Immunities of Citizens in\nthe several States\u201d? That question was answered perhaps\nmost famously by Justice Bushrod Washington sitting as\nCircuit Justice in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546,\n551\u2212552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1825). In that case, a\nPennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law pro\nhibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the\nState\u2019s waters violated Article IV, \u00a72 because it deprived\nhim, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey\navailed to its own citizens. Id., at 550. Justice Washing\nton rejected that argument, refusing to \u201caccede to the\nproposition\u201d that Article IV, \u00a72 entitled \u201ccitizens of the\nseveral states . . . to participate in all the rights which\nbelong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular\nstate.\u201d Id., at 552 (emphasis added). In his view, Article\nIV, \u00a72 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits\na State might choose to make available to its citizens. See\nid., at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights \u201cwhich\nare, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right,\nto the citizens of all free governments.\u201d Id., at 551 (em\nphasis added). Other courts generally agreed with this\nprinciple. See, e.g., Abbott v. Bayley, 23 Mass. 89, 92\u201393\n(1827) (noting that the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of\ncitizens in the several States protected by Article IV, \u00a72\nare \u201cqualified and not absolute\u201d because they do not grant\na traveling citizen the right of \u201csuffrage or of eligibility to\noffice\u201d in the State to which he travels).\n   When describing those \u201cfundamental\u201d rights, Justice\nWashington thought it \u201cwould perhaps be more tedious\nthan difficult to enumerate\u201d them all, but suggested that\nthey could \u201cbe all comprehended under\u201d a broad list of\n\u201cgeneral heads,\u201d such as \u201c[p]rotection by the government,\u201d\n\u201cthe enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

On this question, the weight of\nlegal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated\nthat Article IV, \u00a72 prohibited States from discriminating\nagainst sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental\nrights, but did not require States to recognize those rights\nand did not prescribe their content. The highest courts of\nseveral States adopted this view, see, e.g., Livingston v.\nVan Ingen, 9 Johns. 507, 561 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1812) (Yates,\nJ.); id., at 577 (Kent, J.); Campbell v.

The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to\nreside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional\npursuits, or otherwise; to claim the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus;\nto institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the state;\nto take, hold and dispose of property, either real or personal; and an\nexemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other\ncitizens of the state; may be mentioned as some of the particular\nprivileges and immunities of citizens, which are clearly embraced by\nthe general description of privileges deemed to be fundamental: to\nwhich may be added, the elective franchise, as regulated and estab\nlished by the laws or constitution of the state in which it is to be exer\ncised.\u201d 6 Fed.

This Court adopted\nthe same conclusion in a unanimous opinion just one year\nafter the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Paul\nv.

First, \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d were synonyms\nfor \u201crights.\u201d Second, both the States and the Federal\nGovernment had long recognized the inalienable rights of\ntheir citizens. Third, Article IV, \u00a72 of the Constitution\nprotected traveling citizens against state discrimination\nwith respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.\n  Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual\nsimilarity between \u00a71\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause\nand Article IV, \u00a72. The first involves the nature of the\nrights at stake: Are the privileges or immunities of \u201cciti\nzens of the United States\u201d recognized by \u00a71 the same as\nthe privileges and immunities of \u201ccitizens in the several\nStates\u201d to which Article IV, \u00a72 refers? The second involves\nthe restriction imposed on the States: Does \u00a71, like Article\nIV, \u00a72, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain\nrights if the State chooses to recognize them, or does it\nrequire States to recognize those rights? I address each\nquestion in turn.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Section 1 overruled Dred\nScott\u2019s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the\nUnited States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy\n\u201cthe privileges and immunities of citizens\u201d embodied in the\nConstitution. 19 How., at 417. The Court in Dred Scott\ndid not distinguish between privileges and immunities of\ncitizens of the United States and citizens in the several\nStates, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.\nIt did, however, give examples of what the rights of citi\nzens were\u2014the constitutionally enumerated rights of \u201cthe\nfull liberty of speech\u201d and the right \u201cto keep and carry\narms.\u201d Ibid.\n   Section 1 protects the rights of citizens \u201cof the United\nStates\u201d specifically. The evidence overwhelmingly demon\nstrates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens\nincluded individual rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nincluding the right to keep and bear arms.\n                              1\n  Nineteenth-century treaties through which the United\nStates acquired territory from other sovereigns routinely\npromised inhabitants of the newly acquired territories\nthat they would enjoy all of the \u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d and\n\u201cimmunities\u201d of United States citizens. See, e.g., Treaty of\nAmity, Settlement, and Limits, Art. 6, Feb. 22, 1819, 8\nStat. 256\u2212258, T. S.

It\nis therefore altogether unsurprising that several of these\ntreaties identify liberties enumerated in the Constitution\nas privileges and immunities common to all United States\ncitizens.\n   For example, the Louisiana Cession Act of 1803, which\ncodified a treaty between the United States and France\nculminating in the Louisiana Purchase, provided that\n     \u201cThe inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incor\n     porated in the Union of the United States, and admit\n     ted as soon as possible, according to the principles of\n     the Federal constitution, to the enjoyments of all the\n     rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the\n     United States; and in the mean time they shall be\n     maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\n     their liberty, property and the religion which they pro\n     fess.\u201d Treaty Between the United States of America\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See  also Treaty Between the United States of America and the Ot\ntawa Indians of Blanchard\u2019s Fork and Roche De Boeuf, June 24, 1862,\n12 Stat. 1237 (\u201cThe Ottawa Indians of the United Bands of Blanchard\u2019s\nFork and of Roche de Boeuf, having become sufficiently advanced in\ncivilization, and being desirous of becoming citizens of the United\nStates . . .

In 1820, when the Missouri Terri\ntory (which the United States acquired through the Ces\nsion Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a\ndebate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within\nMissouri as a condition of its admission. Some congress\nmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would\ndeprive its inhabitants of the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d\nthey had been promised by the Cession Act. See, e.g., 35\nAnnals of Cong. 1083 (1855) (remarks of Kentucky Rep.\nHardin). But those who opposed slavery in Missouri\nargued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter\nof state property law, not one of the privileges and immu\nnities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Subsequent treaties contained similar guarantees that the inhabi\n\ntants of the newly acquired territories would enjoy the freedom to\nexercise certain constitutional rights.

In other words, Webster articulated a distinction\nbetween the rights of United States citizenship and the\nrights of state citizenship, and argued that the former\nincluded those rights \u201crecognized or communicated by the\nConstitution.\u201d Since the right to hold slaves was not\nmentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal\ncitizenship.\n   Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over\nslavery in Missouri and the territory was admitted as a\nslave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compro\nmise.

That Committee\nwould ultimately recommend the adoption of the Four\nteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by\nsubmitting a report to Congress that extensively cata\nlogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States\nand argued that \u201cadequate security for future peace and\nsafety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic\nlaw as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all\ncitizens in all parts of the republic.\u201d See Report of the\nJoint Committee on Reconstruction, S.

Before considering that record here, it is\nimportant to clarify its relevance. When interpreting\nconstitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely\npublic understanding of a particular provision at the time\nit was adopted. Statements by legislators can assist in\nthis process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in\nwhich the public used or understood a particular word or\nphrase. They can further assist to the extent there is\nevidence that these statements were disseminated to the\npublic. In other words, this evidence is useful not because\nit demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have\nbeen thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the\npublic understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to\nmean.\n                             (1)\n  Three speeches stand out as particularly significant.\nRepresentative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of\n\u00a71, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in Febru\nary 1866 introducing his first draft of the provision. Bing\nham began by discussing Barron and its holding that the\nBill of Rights did not apply to the States.

A front-page article hailed the \u201cClear\nand Forcible Speech\u201d by Representative Robert Hale\nagainst the draft, explaining\u2014and endorsing\u2014Hale\u2019s view\nthat Bingham\u2019s proposal would \u201cconfer upon Congress all\nthe rights and power of legislation now reserved to the\nStates\u201d and would \u201cin effect utterly obliterate State rights\nand State authority over their own internal affairs.\u201d12\nN. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1.\n   Critically, Hale did not object to the draft insofar as it\npurported to protect constitutional liberties against state\ninterference. Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incor\nrectly in light of Barron) that individual rights enumer\nated in the Constitution were already enforceable against\nthe States. See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (\u201cI have, somehow\nor other, gone along with the impression that there is that\nsort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether\nwith or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we\nare so protected\u201d); see N.

In the\ninterim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech,\nagain arguing that a constitutional amendment was re\nquired to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of\nRights against the States. That speech was printed in\npamphlet form, see Speech of Hon. John A. Bingham, of\nOhio, on the Civil Rights Bill, Mar. 9, 1866 (Cong. Globe);\nsee 39th Cong. Globe 1837 (remarks of Rep.

Times, Mar. 10, 1866, p. 1.\n  By the time the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment\nresumed, Bingham had amended his draft of \u00a71 to include\nthe text of the Privileges or Immunities Clause that was\nultimately adopted. Senator Jacob Howard introduced the\nnew draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech\nrelevant here. Howard explained that the Constitution\nrecognized \u201ca mass of privileges, immunities, and rights,\nsome of them secured by the second section of the fourth\narticle of the Constitution, . . . some by the first eight\namendments of the Constitution,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no\npower given in the Constitution to enforce and to carry out\nany of these guarantees\u201d against the States. 39th Cong.\nGlobe 2765.

CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that\n\u00a71 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared\nrights against the States, and they provide no suggestion\nthat any language in the section other than the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.\n                              (2)\n   When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legis\nlation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further sup\nports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amend\nment\u2014which outlawed slavery alone\u2014and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of\nlegislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\nwhich provided that \u201call persons born in the United\nStates\u201d were \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d and that \u201csuch\ncitizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same\nright\u201d to, among other things, \u201cfull and equal benefit of all\nlaws and proceedings for the security of person and prop\nerty, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d Ch. 31, \u00a71, 14 Stat.\n27.\n   Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it\nas providing the \u201cprivileges\u201d of citizenship to freedmen,\nand defined those privileges to include constitutional\nrights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th\nCong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that\nthe \u201cthe late slaveholding States\u201d had enacted laws \u201cde\npriving persons of African descent of privileges which are\nessential to freemen,\u201d including \u201cprohibit[ing] any negro or\nmulatto from having fire-arms\u201d and stating that \u201c[t]he\npurpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all\nthese discriminations\u201d); id., at 1266\u20131267 (remarks of Rep.\nRaymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to\n\u201c[m]ake a colored man a citizen of the United States\u201d\nwould guarantee to him, inter alia, \u201ca defined status . . . a\nright to defend himself and his wife and children; a right\nto bear arms\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Act stated expressly\nthat the rights of personal liberty and security protected\nby the Act \u201cinclud[ed] the constitutional right to bear\narms.\u201d Ibid.\n                              (3)\n   There is much else in the legislative record. Many\nstatements by Members of Congress corroborate the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced consti\ntutionally enumerated rights against the States. See\nCurtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any\nstatement that directly refutes that proposition. That\nsaid, the record of the debates\u2014like most legislative his\ntory\u2014is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambi\nguity derives from the fact that at least several Members\ndescribed \u00a71 as protecting the privileges and immunities\nof citizens \u201cin the several States,\u201d harkening back to Arti\ncle IV, \u00a72. See supra, at 28\u201329 (describing Sen. Howard\u2019s\nspeech). These statements can be read to support the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or\nall the fundamental rights of \u201ccitizens\u201d described in Cor\nfield. They can also be read to support the view that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, \u00a72, pro\nhibits only state discrimination with respect to those\nrights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to\ndeny those rights to all citizens equally.\n   I examine the rest of the historical record with this\nunderstanding. But for purposes of discerning what the\npublic most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities\nClause to mean, it is significant that the most widely\npublicized statements by the legislators who voted on \u00a71\u2014\nBingham, Howard, and even Hale\u2014point unambiguously\n32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntoward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause enforces at least those fundamental rights enu\nmerated in the Constitution against the States, including\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n                               3\n   Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the\nperiod immediately following its ratification help to estab\nlish the public understanding of the text at the time of its\nadoption.\n   Some of these interpretations come from Members of\nCongress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes\nlisted the Constitution\u2019s first eight Amendments, includ\ning \u201cthe right to keep and bear arms,\u201d before explaining\nthat after the Civil War, the country \u201cgave the most grand\nof all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one\nsingle amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of\nAmerican citizens\u201d who formerly were slaves. Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475\u2013476 (1871). \u201cIt is all\nthese,\u201d Dawes explained, \u201cwhich are comprehended in the\nwords \u2018American citizen.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 334 (re\nmarks of Rep.

Even opponents of\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowl\nedged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected\nconstitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2\nCong. Rec. 384\u2013385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (oppos\ning enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to\nthe Bill of Rights, that \u201c[t]hese first amendments and\nsome provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace\nthe \u2018privileges and immunities\u2019 of citizenship as set forth\nin article 4, section 2 of the Constitution and in the four\nteenth amendment\u201d (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166\u2013170\n(collecting examples).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights\nAct of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part\n\u201cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d and\nwhich is codified in the still-existing 42 U.

C. \u00a71983 (em\nphasis added). Although the Judiciary ignored this provi\nsion for decades after its enactment, this Court has come\nto interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text,\nas protecting constitutionally enumerated rights. Monroe\nv. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171 (1961).\n   A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future\nJustice of this Court adopted the same understanding of\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 79, 82 (No. 15,282) (CC SD Ala.\n1871) (Woods, J.) (\u201cWe think, therefore, that the . . . rights\nenumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the\nconstitution of the United States, are the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens of the United States\u201d). In addition,\ntwo of the era\u2019s major constitutional treatises reflected the\nunderstanding that \u00a71 would protect constitutionally\nenumerated rights from state abridgment.14 A third such\ntreatise unambiguously indicates that the Privileges or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 See J.

Paschal,\nThe Constitution of the United States 290 (1868) (explain\ning that the rights listed in \u00a71 had \u201calready been guaran\ntied\u201d by Article IV and the Bill of Rights, but that \u201c[t]he\nnew feature declared\u201d by \u00a71 was that these rights, \u201cwhich\nhad been construed to apply only to the national govern\nment, are thus imposed upon the States\u201d).\n   Another example of public understanding comes from\nUnited States Attorney Daniel Corbin\u2019s statement in an\n1871 Ku Klux Klan prosecution.

As the Court demonstrates, there\ncan be no doubt that \u00a71 was understood to enforce the\nSecond Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22\u2013\n33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear\narms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen\nship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The municipal re\nspondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former\ninterpretation. They contend that the Second Amend\nment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth,\nauthorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun\npossession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State\napplies it to all citizens equally.15 The Court explains why\nthis antidiscrimination-only reading of \u00a71 as a whole is\n\u201cimplausible.\u201d Ante, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to\nthe States, I must explain why this Clause in particular\nprotects against more than just state discrimination, and\nin fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all\nAmerican citizens.\n                              1\n   I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immuni\nties Clause opens with the command that \u201cNo State shall\u201d\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The municipal respondents and JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent raise a\n\nmost unusual argument that \u00a71 prohibits discriminatory laws affecting\nonly the right to keep and bear arms, but offers substantive protection\nto other rights enumerated in the Constitution, such as the freedom of\nspeech. See post, at 24. Others, however, have made the more compre\nhensive\u2014and internally consistent\u2014argument that \u00a71 bars discrimina\ntion alone and does not afford protection to any substantive rights. See,\ne.g., R. Berger, Government By Judiciary: The Transformation of the\nFourteenth Amendment (1997). I address the coverage of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause only as it applies to the Second Amendment\nright presented here, but I do so with the understanding that my\nconclusion may have implications for the broader argument.\n36                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nUnited States. Amdt. 14, \u00a71 (emphasis added). The very\nsame phrase opens Article I, \u00a710 of the Constitution,\nwhich prohibits the States from \u201cpass[ing] any Bill of\nAttainder\u201d or \u201cex post facto Law,\u201d among other things.\nArticle I, \u00a710 is one of the few constitutional provisions\nthat limits state authority. In Barron, when Chief Justice\nMarshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking \u201cplain\nand intelligible language\u201d restricting state power to in\nfringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, \u00a710\nas an example of text that would have accomplished that\ntask. 7 Pet., at 250. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would\nlater describe Article I, \u00a710 as \u201ca bill of rights for the\npeople of each state.\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138\n(1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause uses the command \u201c[n]o State shall\u201d\u2014which Arti\ncle IV, \u00a72 does not\u2014strongly suggests that the former\nimposes a greater restriction on state power than the\nlatter.\n   This interpretation is strengthened when one considers\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb\n\u201cabridge,\u201d rather than \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d to describe the limit\nit imposes on state authority. The Webster\u2019s dictionary in\nuse at the time of Reconstruction defines the word\n\u201cabridge\u201d to mean \u201c[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to\nabridge one of his rights.\u201d Webster, An American Diction\nary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best\nunderstood to impose a limitation on state power to in\nfringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no\nindication that the Framers of the Clause used the word\n\u201cabridge\u201d to prohibit only discrimination.\n   This most natural textual reading is underscored by a\nwell-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment\nthat the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several\nSouthern States refused to ratify the Amendment, Presi\ndent Johnson met with their Governors to draft a com\npromise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5.

Fleming ed. 1950)\n    (hereinafter Fleming).\n  Significantly, this proposal removed the \u201c[n]o State\nshall\u201d directive and the verb \u201cabridge\u201d from \u00a71, and also\nchanged the class of rights to be protected from those\nbelonging to \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d to those of the\n\u201ccitizens in the several States.\u201d This phrasing is materi\nally indistinguishable from Article IV, \u00a72, which gener\nally was understood as an antidiscrimination provision\nalone. See supra, at 15\u201318. The proposal thus strongly\nindicates that at least the President of the United States\nand several southern Governors thought that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully\ntried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored\ndiscrimination.\n                              2\n  The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by\na claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of \u00a71\ngenerally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argu\nment goes, \u00a71 must not have been understood to accom\nplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal\nenforcement of a minimum baseline of rights. That argu\nment overlooks critical aspects of the Nation\u2019s history that\nunderscored the need for, and wide agreement upon,\n38                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfederal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights\nagainst the States, including the right to keep and bear\narms.\n                               a\n   I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification. It\nis true that the congressional debates over \u00a71 were rela\ntively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of\nextensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures\ndid not keep records of their debates, and the few records\nthat do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis\n145. These facts are not surprising.\n   First, however consequential we consider the question\ntoday, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not\nthe most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend\nment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just\nendured a tumultuous civil war, and \u00a7\u00a72, 3, and 4\u2014which\nreduced the representation of States that denied voting\nrights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers\nof the power to hold elective office, and required States to\ndisavow Confederate war debts\u2014were far more polarizing\nand consumed far more political attention. See Wilden\nthal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the\nFourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866\u20131868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).\n   Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth\nAmendment reveal that many representatives, and proba\nbly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend\nment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina\ntion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights\nagainst the States. Justice Black\u2019s dissent in Adamson\nchronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107\u2013108\n(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether\nthat understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu\ntional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little\nto say during the debates about \u00a71.

Like the Framers, see supra, at 14\u201315, many 19th\ncentury Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare\ninalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,\neven though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to\nthe Federal Government, many believed that it declared\nrights that no legitimate government could abridge.\n   Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin\u2019s decision for the Georgia\nSupreme Court in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), illus\ntrates this view. In assessing state power to regulate\nfirearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was \u201caware\nthat it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],\nlike other amendments adopted at the same time, is a\nrestriction upon the government of the United States, and\ndoes not extend to the individual States.\u201d Id., at 250. But\nhe still considered the right to keep and bear arms as \u201can\nunalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free\ngovernment,\u201d and thus found the States bound to honor it.\nIbid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with\nrespect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu\nmerated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the\nprotections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable\nagainst the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi\nnent treatise of the era took the same position.

S., at __\n(slip op., at 34) (describing Rawle\u2019s treatise as \u201cinfluen\ntial\u201d). Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as\nwell. Lysander Spooner championed the popular aboli\ntionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with con\nstitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it\ndeprived black Americans of the \u201cnatural right of all men\n\u2018to keep and bear arms\u2019 for their personal defence,\u201d which\nhe believed the Constitution \u201cprohibit[ed] both Congress\nand the State governments from infringing.\u201d L. Spooner,\nThe Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).\n   In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of\nRights did apply to the States, even though this Court had\nsquarely rejected that theory. See, e.g., supra, at 27\u201328\n(recounting Rep. Hale\u2019s argument to this effect). Many\nothers believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of\nRights were ones that no State should abridge, even\nthough they understood that the Bill technically did not\napply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that\nmost state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the\nindividual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made\nthe need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties\nagainst the States an afterthought. See ante, at 29 (opin\nion of the Court) (noting that, \u201c[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\nexplicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms\u201d).\nThat changed with the national conflict over slavery.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            41\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                              b\n   In the contentious years leading up to the Civil War,\nthose who sought to retain the institution of slavery found\nthat to do so, it was necessary to eliminate more and more\nof the basic liberties of slaves, free blacks, and white\nabolitionists. Congressman Tobias Plants explained that\nslaveholders \u201ccould not hold [slaves] safely where dissent\nwas permitted,\u201d so they decided that \u201call dissent must be\nsuppressed by the strong hand of power.\u201d 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1013. The measures they used were ruthless, re\npressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitu\ntion, and demonstrated that preventing only discrimina\ntory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow\nassurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the\nAmerican people understood this point.\n   The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress\nthe spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant\nrisk of a slave rebellion. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate\nthe extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slave\nholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures.\nSlaves and free blacks represented a substantial percent\nage of the population and posed a severe threat to South\nern order if they were not kept in their place. According to\nthe 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more\nof the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half\nthe population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisi\nana, and more than 50% of the population in Mississippi\nand South Carolina. Statistics of the United States (In\ncluding Mortality, Property, &c.,) in 1860, The Eighth\nCensus 336\u2212350 (1866).\n   The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded.\nAlthough there were others, two particularly notable slave\nuprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In\n1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark\nVesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their\nmasters and flee to Haiti. H. Aptheker, American Negro\n42                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nSlave Revolts 268\u2013270 (1983). The plan was foiled, lead\ning to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of\n37, including Vesey. Id., at 271. Still, slaveowners took\nnotice\u2014it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to\n9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. Id.,\nat 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was real\nized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at\nleast 57 whites before it was suppressed. Id., at 300\u2013302.\n  The fear generated by these and other rebellions led\nSouthern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at\nthe rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and\nbear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even\nthe Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in\nsome States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution:\nSlavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956). Vir\nginia made it a crime for a member of an \u201cabolition\u201d soci\nety to enter the State and argue \u201cthat the owners of slaves\nhave no property in the same, or advocate or advise the\nabolition of slavery.\u201d 1835\u20131836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44.\nOther States prohibited the circulation of literature deny\ning a master\u2019s right to property in his slaves and passed\nlaws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search\nof such material.

Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought\nStruggle in the Old South 118\u2013143, 199\u2013200 (1964).\n  Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting\nslaves from carrying firearms18 to apply the prohibition to\nfree blacks as well.

Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865\u2013\n1877, p. 104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).\n   As the Court explains, this fear led to \u201csystematic ef\nforts\u201d in the \u201cold Confederacy\u201d to disarm the more than\n180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as\nwell as other free blacks. See ante, at 23. Some States\nformally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. Ante,\nat 23\u201324 (quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, \u00a71, reprinted in\n1 Fleming 289). Others enacted legislation prohibiting\nblacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restric\ntion not imposed on whites. See, e.g., La. Statute of 1865,\nreprinted in id., at 280. Additionally, \u201c[t]hroughout the\nSouth, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate\nsoldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms\nfrom newly freed slaves.\u201d Ante, at 24.\n   As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth\nAmendment \u201chad outlawed only those laws that discrimi\nnate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude,\nAfrican-Americans in the South would likely have re\nmained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abus\ners: the state militia and state peace officers.\u201d Ante, at 32.\nIn the years following the Civil War, a law banning fire\narm possession outright \u201cwould have been nondiscrimina\ntory only in the formal sense,\u201d for it would have \u201cleft fire\narms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the\ntime the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The pub\nlicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see ante, at\n23\u201324 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens\nindicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a\nfederal solution to this problem, see, e.g., 39th Cong.

CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nSee Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 548\u2013549, 551\u2013553. I must,\ntherefore, consider whether stare decisis requires reten\ntion of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my\ninquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not\nendeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent,\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other\nrights enumerated in the Constitution against the\nStates.20 Nor do I suggest that the stare decisis considera\ntions surrounding the application of the right to keep and\nbear arms against the States would be the same as those\nsurrounding another right protected by the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause. I consider stare decisis only as it\napplies to the question presented here.\n                              A\n  This inquiry begins with the Slaughter-House Cases.\nThere, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a\nmonopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of\nNew Orleans to a newly incorporated company. 16 Wall.\n36. Butchers excluded by the monopoly sued, claiming\nthat the statute violated the Privileges or Immunities\nClause because it interfered with their right to pursue and\n\u201cexercise their trade.\u201d Id., at 60. This Court rejected the\nbutchers\u2019 claim, holding that their asserted right was not a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 Inote, however, that I see no reason to assume that the constitu\ntionally enumerated rights protected by the Privileges or Immunities\nClause should consist of all the rights recognized in the Bill of Rights\nand no others. Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights\nprotect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2 (granting the \u201cPrivi\nlege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d), and there is no obvious evidence\nthat the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to\nexclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent\nfederal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as\nprotecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth\nAmendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment\u2019s\nEstablishment Clause, which \u201cdoes not purport to protect individual\nrights.\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50\n(2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see Amar 179\u2013180.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court held that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of\nfederal citizenship\u2014those \u201cwhich owe their existence to\nthe Federal government, its National character, its Con\nstitution, or its laws,\u201d id., at 79\u2014and did not protect any\nof the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other\nwords, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually\nexclusive.\n   After separating these two sets of rights, the Court\ndefined the rights of state citizenship as \u201cembrac[ing]\nnearly every civil right for the establishment and protec\ntion of which organized government is instituted\u201d\u2014that is,\nall those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer\nring to \u201cthose rights\u201d that \u201cJudge Washington\u201d described).\nThat left very few rights of federal citizenship for the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court\nsuggested a handful of possibilities, such as the \u201cright of\nfree access to [federal] seaports,\u201d protection of the Federal\nGovernment while traveling \u201con the high seas,\u201d and even\ntwo rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting\n\u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and \u201cthe privilege of\nthe writ of habeas corpus\u201d); see supra, at 4. But its deci\nsion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship\nas mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to\nconclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were\nexcluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause\u2019s scope.\nSee Cruikshank, supra.\n   I reject that understanding. There was no reason to\ninterpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting\nthe Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the \u201cprivi\nleges and immunities\u201d of federal citizenship to mean ei\nther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights\nat all. 16 Wall., at 76. The record is scant that the public\nunderstood the Clause to make the Federal Government\n\u201ca perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States\u201d as\n50                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one\nthing, Corfield listed the \u201celective franchise\u201d as one of the\nprivileges and immunities of \u201ccitizens of the several\nstates,\u201d 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still\nfound it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment\u2014\nwhich protects \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States\nto vote\u201d\u2014two years after the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\npassage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were\nunderstood to protect every conceivable civil right from\nstate abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have\nbeen redundant.\n   The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable\nrights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to\nsay that the privileges and immunities of state and federal\ncitizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s ratification, States performed many more\nfunctions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely\nthat, simply by referring to \u201cprivileges or immunities,\u201d the\nFramers of \u00a71 meant to transfer every right mentioned in\nCorfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, \u201cprivi\nleges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d were understood only as syno\nnyms for \u201crights.\u201d See supra, at 9\u201311. It was their at\ntachment to a particular group that gave them content,\nand the text and history recounted here indicate that the\nrights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi\ncal to the rights of citizens \u201cin the several States.\u201d Justice\nSwayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made\nthe point clear:\n     \u201cThe citizen of a State has the same fundamental\n     rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer\n     tain others, local in their character, arising from his\n     relation to the State, and in addition, those which be\n     long to the citizen of the United States, he being in\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

There may thus be a double citi\n     zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It\n     is only over those which belong to the citizen of the\n     United States that the category here in question\n     throws the shield of its protection.\u201d 16 Wall., at 126\n     (emphasis added).\nBecause the privileges and immunities of American citi\nzenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nthey overlap to at least some extent with the privileges\nand immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the\nseveral States.\n  A separate question is whether the privileges and im\nmunities of American citizenship include any rights be\nsides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four\ndissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the\nunenumerated right that the butchers in that case as\nserted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111\n(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent\ning). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated\nright, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether\nthe Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court\u2019s\njudgment in Slaughter-House was correct.\n  Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer\nated rights against the States creates \u201c \u2018special hazards\u2019 \u201d\nthat should prevent this Court from returning to the\noriginal meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 To the extent JUSTICE STEVENS is concerned that reliance on the\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may invite judges to \u201cwrite their\npersonal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution,\u201d post,\nat 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), his celebration of the alterna\ntive\u2014the \u201cflexibility,\u201d \u201ctranscend[ence],\u201d and \u201cdynamism\u201d of substan\ntive due process\u2014speaks for itself, post, at 14\u201315, 20.\n52                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, which\nillustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to\nrecognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of\ntextual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to\nassume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im\nmunities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not\nexpressly list the rights it protects does not render it\nincapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu\ntion contains many provisions that require an examination\nof more than just constitutional text to determine whether\na particular act is within Congress\u2019 power or is otherwise\nprohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18 (Necessary and\nProper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying\nera understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to\nmean, interpreting it should be no more \u201chazardous\u201d than\ninterpreting these other constitutional provisions by using\nthe same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But\nthey will have the advantage of being questions the Con\nstitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are\nmore worthy of this Court\u2019s attention\u2014and far more likely\nto yield discernable answers\u2014than the substantive due\nprocess questions the Court has for years created on its\nown, with neither textual nor historical support.\n   Finding these impediments to returning to the original\nmeaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it\nprecludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the\nstare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent\nthat expressly controls the question presented here.\n                            B\n  Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik\nshank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Cruik\nshank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws\nin its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities\nClause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its\noriginal meaning, and I would reject the holding on that\nbasis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant\nmention as well.\n   Cruikshank\u2019s holding that blacks could look only to state\ngovernments for protection of their right to keep and bear\narms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of\nlocal governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and\ntheir descendants through a wave of private violence\ndesigned to drive blacks from the voting booth and force\nthem into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without\nfederal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and\nbear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc\ncessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very\npeople the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.\n   Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.\nThere, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a\ntroop of black militiamen for no other reason than that\nthey had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July\nparade through their mostly black town. The white mili\ntia commander, \u201cPitchfork\u201d Ben Tillman, later described\nthis massacre with pride: \u201c[T]he leading white men of\nEdgefield\u201d had decided \u201cto seize the first opportunity that\nthe negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach\nthe negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate\ntheir superiority by killing as many of them as was justifi\nable.\u201d S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman & the Reconstruction of\nWhite Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and inter\nnal quotation marks omitted).

Militias such as the\nKu Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the\nWhite Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the \u201976 Associa\ntion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by\nbreaking up Republican meetings, threatening political\nleaders, and whipping black militiamen.

As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said\nto have explained, \u201c \u2018[t]he Negro has been run over for fifty\nyears, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are\nthe only weapons to stop a mob.\u2019 \u201d Church Burnings Fol\nlow Negro Agitator\u2019s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6,\n1919, in id., at 124. Sometimes, as in Cooper\u2019s case, self\ndefense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home\nby a mob and killed as his wife looked on. Ibid. But at\nother times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob\nviolence to survive. One man recalled the night during his\nchildhood when his father stood armed at a jail until\nmorning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol, 354. The ex\nperience left him with a sense, \u201cnot \u2018of powerlessness, but\nof the \u201cpossibilities of salvation\u201d \u2019 \u201d that came from stand\ning up to intimidation. Ibid.\n  In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era\npublic understood\u2014just as the Framers of the Second\nAmendment did\u2014that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas essential to the preservation of liberty. The record\nmakes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary\nto include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the\nwake of the War over slavery. There is nothing about\nCruikshank\u2019s contrary holding that warrants its retention.\n                      *    *    *\n  I agree with the Court that the Second Amendment is\n56                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfully applicable to the States. I do so because the right to\nkeep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Fourteenth\nAmendment as a privilege of American citizenship.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 1), the Court answered the question\nwhether a federal enclave\u2019s \u201cprohibition on the possession\nof usable handguns in the home violates the Second\nAmendment to the Constitution.\u201d The question we should\nbe answering in this case is whether the Constitution\n\u201cguarantees individuals a fundamental right,\u201d enforceable\nagainst the States, \u201cto possess a functional, personal\nfirearm, including a handgun, within the home.\u201d Com\u00ad\nplaint \u00b634, App. 23. That is a different\u2014and more diffi\u00ad\ncult\u2014inquiry than asking if the Fourteenth Amendment\n\u201cincorporates\u201d the Second Amendment. The so-called\nincorporation question was squarely and, in my view,\ncorrectly resolved in the late 19th century.1\n   Before the District Court, petitioners focused their\npleadings on the special considerations raised by domestic\npossession, which they identified as the core of their as\u00ad\nserted right. In support of their claim that the city of\nChicago\u2019s handgun ban violates the Constitution, they now\nrely primarily on the Privileges or Immunities Clause of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See United States v.

See id., at 66\u201372. Neither submission\nrequires the Court to express an opinion on whether the\nFourteenth Amendment places any limit on the power of\nStates to regulate possession, use, or carriage of firearms\noutside the home.\n   I agree with the plurality\u2019s refusal to accept petitioners\u2019\nprimary submission.

Their briefs marshal an\nimpressive amount of historical evidence for their argu\u00ad\nment that the Court interpreted the Privileges or Immuni\u00ad\nties Clause too narrowly in the Slaughter-House Cases, 16\nWall. 36 (1873). But the original meaning of the Clause is\nnot as clear as they suggest2\u2014and not nearly as clear as it\nwould need to be to dislodge 137 years of precedent.

But these arguments are less\ncompelling than the plurality suggests; they are much less\ncompelling when applied outside the home; and their\nvalidity does not depend on the Court\u2019s holding in Heller.\nFor that holding sheds no light on the meaning of the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Judge Wilkinson\u2019s\npoint is broader than the privileges or immunities debate. As he\nobserves, \u201cthere may be more structure imposed by provisions subject\nto generations of elaboration and refinement than by a provision in its\npristine state. The fortuities of uneven constitutional development\nmust be respected, not cast aside in the illusion of reordering the\nlandscape anew.\u201d Id., at 51\u201352; see also Washington v.

As I read the\nvast corpus of substantive due process opinions, they\nconfirm several important principles that ought to guide\nour resolution of this case. The principal opinion\u2019s lengthy\nsummary of our \u201cincorporation\u201d doctrine, see ante, at 5\u20139,\n11\u201319 (majority opinion), 10\u201311 (plurality opinion), and its\nimplicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine\nfrom the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence,\ninvite a fresh survey of this old terrain.\nSubstantive Content\n  The first, and most basic, principle established by our\ncases is that the rights protected by the Due Process\nClause are not merely procedural in nature. At first\nglance, this proposition might seem surprising, given that\nthe Clause refers to \u201cprocess.\u201d But substance and proce\u00ad\ndure are often deeply entwined. Upon closer inspection,\nthe text can be read to \u201cimpos[e] nothing less than an\nobligation to give substantive content to the words \u2018liberty\u2019\nand \u2018due process of law,\u2019 \u201d Washington v.

To\nthe contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least\nby the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the\nphrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d had acquired substantive\ncontent as a term of art within the legal community.5 This\nunderstanding is consonant with the venerable \u201cnotion\nthat governmental authority has implied limits which\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 See, e.g., Ely, The Oxymoron Reconsidered: Myth and Reality in the\n\nOrigins of Substantive Due Process, 16 Const.

Time and again, we have rec\u00ad\nognized that in the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the\nFifth, the \u201cDue Process Clause guarantees more than fair\nprocess, and the \u2018liberty\u2019 it protects includes more than the\nabsence of physical restraint.\u201d Glucksberg, 521 U.

Planned Parent\u00ad\nhood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847\n(1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews\n\u201cthe origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the\nabiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain\nstate intrusions on the citizen\u2019s right to decide how he will\nlive his own life intolerable.\u201d Fitzgerald v.

But as I\nhave observed on numerous occasions, \u201cmost of the signifi\u00ad\ncant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues\nhave, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word\n\u2018liberty\u2019 in the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d8\n   It follows that the term \u201cincorporation,\u201d like the term\n\u201cunenumerated rights,\u201d is something of a misnomer.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Stevens, The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress, 59 U.

The Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.\u201d10\nInclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. This Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018selective\nincorporation\u2019 \u201d doctrine, ante, at 15, is not simply \u201crelated\u201d\nto substantive due process, ante, at 19; it is a subset\nthereof.\nFederal/State Divergence\n  The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from\nthe second: The rights protected against state infringement\nby the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause need\nnot be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected\nagainst Federal Government infringement by the various\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsame basic approach to \u201cincorporation,\u201d with the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment taken as a distinct source of rights independent from the first\neight Amendments.

The issue is closed\u201d). Wolf\u2019s holding on the exclusionary\nrule was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), but the\nprinciple just quoted has never been disturbed. It is notable that\nMapp, the case that launched the modern \u201cdoctrine of ad hoc,\u201d \u201c \u2018jot-for\u00ad\njot\u2019 \u201d incorporation, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.

Although the enactment of the Fourteenth\nAmendment profoundly altered our legal order, it \u201cdid not\nunstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our consti\u00ad\ntutional fabric.\u201d Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 133\n(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that\nmatter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Con\u00ad\nstitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty,\nstill \u201cestablishes a federal republic where local differences\nare to be cherished as elements of liberty\u201d in the vast run\nof cases, National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. v. Chicago, 567\nF. 3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allo\u00ad\ncates a general \u201cpolice power . . . to the States and the\nStates alone,\u201d United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 4) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text\nand structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to\nhold state governments to different standards than the\nFederal Government in certain areas.11\n   It is true, as the Court emphasizes, ante, at 15\u201319, that\nwe have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights\nfully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance,\nthat the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the\nPresident of the United States to authorize unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23\n(1963). But we have never accepted a \u201ctotal incorporation\u201d\ntheory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the\nAmendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the\nBill of Rights en masse. See ante, at 15. And we have\ndeclined to apply several provisions to the States in any\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Ican hardly improve upon the many passionate defenses of this\nposition that Justice Harlan penned during his tenure on the Court.\nSee Williams, 399 U.

S. 211 (1916) (Seventh Amendment);\nHurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Grand Jury\nClause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach\nto the Sixth Amendment\u2019s criminal jury guarantee, de\u00ad\nmanding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in\nfederal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore\u00ad\ngon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399\nU. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de\u00ad\nclined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While\nthose denials have no precedential significance, they\nconfirm the proposition that the \u201cincorporation\u201d of a provi\u00ad\nsion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment\ndoes not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely\nthe same meaning in both contexts.\n   It is true, as well, that during the 1960\u2019s the Court\ndecided a number of cases involving procedural rights in\nwhich it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans\u00ad\nplanted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395\nU. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.\nTexas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).\n\u201cJot-for-jot\u201d incorporation was the norm in this expansion\u00ad\nary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that\nthese precedents require perfect state/federal congruence\nonly on matters \u201c \u2018at the core\u2019 \u201d of the relevant constitutional\nguarantee. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also\nid., at 52\u201353 (Powell, J., dissenting). In my judgment, this\nline of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to\nensure a criminal trial satisfies essential standards of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 See, e.g., Pet. for Cert. in Bowen v.

CHICAGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfairness, some procedures should be the same in state and\nfederal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is\nmore pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when\ncriminal justice is at issue. That principle has little rele\u00ad\nvance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set\nforth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib\u00ad\nerty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378\nU. S., at 10\u201311, it is therefore an overstatement to say\nthat the Court has \u201cabandoned,\u201d ante, at 16, 17 (majority\nopinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a \u201ctwo-track approach to\nincorporation,\u201d ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court\nmoved away from that approach in the area of criminal\nprocedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda\u00ad\nmental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill\nof Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some\n1960\u2019s opinions purported to establish a general method of\nincorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court\nhas not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court\nexcesses in more areas than I can count.\n   I do not mean to deny that there can be significant\npractical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights\nsymmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov\u00ad\nernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may\nentail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore\ngreater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora\u00ad\ntion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of\nthe legal rule. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356,\n384\u2013388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380\nU. S., at 413\u2013414 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federal\u00ad\nist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry\nsubstantial costs. When a federal court insists that state\nand local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not\ncritical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter\nmay be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent\n\u201cexperimentation in things social and economic\u201d that\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. 262, 311 (1932)\n(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts\u2019\nimposing a uniform national standard may be especially\nhigh when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi\u00ad\ncantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the\nStates\u2019 core police powers.\n  Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the\nStates, federal courts will cause those provisions to \u201cbe\nwatered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.\u201d\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 182, n. 21 (1968)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must\nprevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs\nand customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan\u00ad\ndard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when\nwe move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure\nand into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.\nSo long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are\nalways and everywhere respected, it is not clear that\ngreater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a\nprovision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is\nfar from clear that proponents of an individual right to\nkeep and bear arms ought to celebrate today\u2019s decision.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and\n\nbear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional\nRights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191 (2006)\n(cataloguing provisions); Brief for Petitioners 69 (observing that\n\u201c[t]hese Second Amendment analogs are effective and consequential\u201d),\nbut the States vary widely in their regulatory schemes, their traditions\nand cultures of firearm use, and their problems relating to gun vio\u00ad\nlence. If federal and state courts must harmonize their review of gun\u00ad\ncontrol laws under the Second Amendment, the resulting jurisprudence\nmay prove significantly more deferential to those laws than the status\nquo ante. Once it has been established that a single legal standard\nmust govern nationwide, federal courts will face a profound pressure to\nreconcile that standard with the diverse interests of the States and\n14                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                              II\n   So far, I have explained that substantive due process\nanalysis generally requires us to consider the term \u201clib\u00ad\nerty\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment, and that this inquiry\nmay be informed by but does not depend upon the content\nof the Bill of Rights. How should a court go about the\nanalysis, then? Our precedents have established, not an\nexact methodology, but rather a framework for decision\u00ad\nmaking. In this respect, too, the Court\u2019s narrative fails to\ncapture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.\n   The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo\nmore than 70 years ago. When confronted with a substan\u00ad\ntive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly\nunlawful practice violates values \u201cimplicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.\u201d Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319,\n325 (1937).14 If the practice in question lacks any \u201coppres\u00ad\nsive and arbitrary\u201d character, if judicial enforcement of the\nasserted right would not materially contribute to \u201ca fair\nand enlightened system of justice,\u201d then the claim is un\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntheir long history of regulating in this sensitive area.

Implicit in Justice Cardozo\u2019s test is a recognition\nthat the postulates of liberty have a universal character.\nLiberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that\nprevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations\nof a certain group, or the personal preferences of their\nchampions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they\nare not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized\nas a \u201crational continuum\u201d of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral\ncommitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause\ntranscend the local and the particular.\n   Justice Cardozo\u2019s test undeniably requires judges to\napply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not\nmean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In\naddition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part\nIII, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds\nground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down\nelsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English\ncommon law, legislative and social facts, scientific and\nprofessional developments, practices of other civilized\nsocieties,15 and, above all else, the \u201c \u2018traditions and con\u00ad\nscience of our people,\u2019 \u201d Palko, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)), are\ncritical variables. They can provide evidence about which\nrights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur\nto judicial action.\n   The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in\nits suggestion that later cases rendered Palko\u2019s methodol\u00ad\nogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that\nJustice Cardozo\u2019s test will not be satisfied \u201c \u2018if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the par\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 See Palko, 302 U.

Palko does contain some language that could be\nread to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process\nrecognition, reserving it for practices without which \u201cnei\u00ad\nther liberty nor justice would exist.\u201d 302 U. S., at 326.\nBut in view of Justice Cardozo\u2019s broader analysis, as well\nas the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims\nunder the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over\u00ad\nreadings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco\u00ad\nnian manner.\n   Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan\nmark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out\nliberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to \u201cpar\u00ad\nticular procedural safeguard[s]\u201d in the Bill of Rights relat\u00ad\ning to \u201ccriminal processes,\u201d 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did\nnot purport to set a standard for other types of liberty\ninterests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,\nDuncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:\nThe judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac\u00ad\ntice \u201cis fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,\u201d within the\ncontext of the \u201cAnglo-American\u201d system. Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149\u2013150, n. 14. Several of our most important\nrecent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive\ndue process analysis\u2014from which, once again, \u201cincorpora\u00ad\ntion\u201d analysis derives\u2014must not be wholly backward\nlooking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572\n(2003) (\u201c[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but\nnot in all cases the ending point of the substantive due\nprocess inquiry\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nMichael H. v.

The Court hinges its entire\ndecision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se\u00ad\nlected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and\n19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about\nfirearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural\u00ad\nity suggests that only interests that have proved \u201cfunda\u00ad\nmental from an American perspective,\u201d ante, at 37, 44, or\n\u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the\nCourt\u2019s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the\nFourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court\u2019s opin\u00ad\nion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a\nright is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its\nstatus under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri\u00ad\nously mistaken.\n   A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most\nbasically, because our substantive due process doctrine\nhas never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even\npredominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied\nmany of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to\nthe States in the 1960\u2019s, it often asked whether the guar\u00ad\nantee in question was \u201cfundamental in the context of the\ncriminal processes maintained by the American States.\u201d17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 I acknowledge that some have read the Court\u2019s opinion in Glucks\u00ad\nberg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all\npurposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology\u2014and thereby to\ndebilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg\u2019s aspiration,\nLawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I\nhave little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.\n  17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question\n\nwas deeply rooted in founding-era practice. See Brief for Respondent\nCity of Chicago et al. 31, n. 17 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents\u2019\nBrief) (noting that only two opinions extensively discussed such his\u00ad\ntory).\n18                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDuncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex\u00ad\ntend back through time, but it was focused not so much on\nhistorical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional\nsignificance within the States\u2019 regimes. This contextual\u00ad\nized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any\ngiven trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It\nis only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes\nwith other procedures and practices in a criminal justice\nsystem that its relationship to \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d\ncan be determined.\n   Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to\nrecognize rights distinct from the trial context\u2014rights\nrelating to the primary conduct of free individuals\u2014\nJustice Cardozo\u2019s test has been our guide. The right to\nfree speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state\ninfringement not because the States have always honored\nit, but because it is \u201cessential to free government\u201d and \u201cto\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions\u201d\u2014that is,\nbecause the right to free speech is implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.

Duncan, 391 U. S., at 183\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing \u201ccircular[ity]\u201d of his\u00ad\ntoricized test for incorporation). That approach is unfaith\u00ad\nful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when\nthey ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level\nof generality they chose when they crafted its language; it\npromises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the\nvalue judgments that pervade any analysis of what cus\u00ad\ntoms, defined in what manner, are sufficiently \u201c \u2018rooted\u2019 \u201d;\nit countenances the most revolting injustices in the name\nof continuity,20 for we must never forget that not only\nslavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank\nforms of discrimination are part of our history; and it\neffaces this Court\u2019s distinctive role in saying what the law\nis, leaving the development and safekeeping of liberty to\nmajoritarian political processes.

In considering\nsuch a majestic term as \u201cliberty\u201d and applying it to present\ncircumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call\nand its open texture\u2014and to the grant of interpretive\ndiscretion the latter embodies\u2014without injecting excessive\nsubjectivity or unduly restricting the States\u2019 \u201cbroad lati\u00ad\ntude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems\nof vital local concern,\u201d Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597\n(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that\nwe must ground the analysis in historical experience and\nreasoned judgment, and never on \u201cmerely personal and\nprivate notions.\u201d Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170\n(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional\nconstraints on the decisional process. Although \u201cguide\u00ad\nposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\narea are scarce and open-ended,\u201d Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U.

Where we part\nways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical\nconsiderations.\n  There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concern that\n\u201ccourts have the last word\u201d on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,\non the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution\u2019s Article V amend\u00ad\nment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of\ncourse reverse this Court\u2019s rulings through that same process.\n  23 In assessing concerns about the \u201copen-ended[ness]\u201d of this area of\n\nlaw, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle\u00ad\nability not only of the Court\u2019s \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d/fundamentality standard\nbut also of substantive due process\u2019 constitutional cousin, \u201cequal\nprotection\u201d analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of\nentailing an insufficiently \u201crestrained methodology.\u201d Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 721. Yet \u201cthe word \u2018liberty\u2019 in the Due Process Clause seems to\nprovide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word \u2018equal\u2019\nin the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d Post, The Supreme Court 2002\nTerm\u2014Foreword: Fashioning the Legal Constitution: Culture, Courts,\nand Law, 117 Harv.

CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to\nprovide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n\u201cliberty.\u201d24 That project is bound to end in failure or\nworse. The Framers did not express a clear understand\u00ad\ning of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated\nLochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial\noverconfidence in using substantive due process to ad\u00ad\nvance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,\nLochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most\ndurable precedents, the Court \u201chas not attempted to define\nwith exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed\u201d by the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,\ne.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499. By its very nature, the\nmeaning of liberty cannot be \u201creduced to any formula; its\ncontent cannot be determined by reference to any code.\u201d\nPoe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Yet while \u201cthe \u2018liberty\u2019 specially protected by the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment\u201d is \u201cperhaps not capable of being fully\nclarified,\u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of\nbeing refined and delimited. We have insisted that only\ncertain types of especially significant personal interests\nmay qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever\nsince \u201cthe deviant economic due process cases [were]\nrepudiated,\u201d id., at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nis that the text of the [Due Process] Clause warrants providing only\nprotections of process rather than protections of substance,\u201d \u201cit is\nstriking that even those Justices who are most theoretically opposed to\nsubstantive due process, like Scalia and Rehnquist, are also nonethe\u00ad\nless enthusiastic about applying the equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal govern\u00ad\nment.\u201d Ibid. (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200,\n213\u2013231 (1995)).\n  24 That one eschews a comprehensive theory of liberty does not, pace\n\nJUSTICE SCALIA, mean that one lacks \u201ca coherent theory of the Due\nProcess Clause,\u201d ante, at 5. It means that one lacks the hubris to adopt\na rigid, context-independent definition of a constitutional guarantee\nthat was deliberately framed in open-ended terms.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 482, and has instead cen\u00ad\ntered on \u201cmatters relating to marriage, procreation, con\u00ad\ntraception, family relationships, and child rearing and\neducation,\u201d Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).\nThese categories are not exclusive. Government action\nthat shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled\nexpectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or\nlife choices without adequate justification, perpetrates\ngross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always\nbe vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact\nthat an asserted right falls within one of these categories\nend the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive\nmore robust judicial protection, but the strength of the\nindividual\u2019s liberty interests and the State\u2019s regulatory\ninterests must always be assessed and compared. No\nright is absolute.\n   Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the\nliberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a\nconceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically,\n\u201cthe ability independently to define one\u2019s identity,\u201d Roberts\nv. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984), \u201cthe\nindividual\u2019s right to make certain unusually important\ndecisions that will affect his own, or his family\u2019s, destiny,\u201d\nFitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected\nas a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,\nfreedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political\nequality, dignity and respect\u2014these are the central values\nwe have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\n   Another key constraint on substantive due process\nanalysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu\u00ad\nlar liberty interest is already being given careful consid\u00ad\neration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the\nStates, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.\nWhen the Court declined to establish a general right to\n24                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nphysician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part\nbecause \u201cthe States [were] currently engaged in serious,\nthoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and\nother similar issues,\u201d rendering judicial intervention both\nless necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks\u00ad\nberg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long\nappreciated that more \u201csearching\u201d judicial review may be\njustified when the rights of \u201cdiscrete and insular minori\u00ad\nties\u201d\u2014groups that may face systematic barriers in the\npolitical system\u2014are at stake. United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have\na \u201ccomparative . . . advantage\u201d over the elected branches\non a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,\nat 8.\n   Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It\ntakes that right, to a considerable extent, \u201coutside the\narena of public debate and legislative action.\u201d Glucksberg,\n521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must\nbe taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig\u00ad\nnity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and\ndemand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to\nthe interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and\nthe practical realities of contemporary society provides an\nimportant tool for guiding judicial discretion.\n   This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the\nneed to approach our work with humility and caution.\nBecause the relevant constitutional language is so \u201cspa\u00ad\ncious,\u201d Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that\n\u201c[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to\nexercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break\nnew ground in this field.\u201d Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many\nof my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same\npoint, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502\u2013\n503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542\u2013545\n(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But\nthe inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section\n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in\nevery case, and \u201c[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,\nin this area, for judgment and restraint.\u201d Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such\nrestraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth\u00ad\ners, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de\u00ad\ncisis\u2014adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter\u00ad\nests, prizing stability and order in the law\u2014and the\ncommon-law method\u2014taking cases and controversies as\nthey present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen\u00ad\ntally, building on what came before. This restrained\nmethodology was evident even in the heyday of \u201cincorpora\u00ad\ntion\u201d during the 1960\u2019s. Although it would have been\nmuch easier for the Court simply to declare certain\nAmendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States\nin toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into\nits component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.\nThis piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize\nmore closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc\u00ad\ning both the risk and the cost of error.\n   Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an\nabstract plane, the Court has \u201crequired in substantive\u00ad\ndue-process cases a \u2018careful description\u2019 of the asserted\nfundamental liberty interest.\u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at\n721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);\nCollins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of\nHealth, 497 U. S. 261, 277\u2013278 (1990)). And just as we\nhave required such careful description from the litigants,\nwe have required of ourselves that we \u201cfocus on the allega\u00ad\ntions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de\u00ad\nscribes the constitutional right at stake.\u201d Collins, 503\nU. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San\n26                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDiego L. Rev. 437, 446\u2013448 (1985). This does not mean\nthat we must define the asserted right at the most specific\nlevel, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a\nmoral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,\nthat we must pay close attention to the precise liberty\ninterest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.\n   Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the\nmost expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for\nsubstantive due process recognition, particular compo\u00ad\nnents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a\ncategorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam\u00ad\nple, does not \u201c \u2018foreclose the possibility that an individual\nplaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose\nassistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular\u00ad\nized challenge.\u2019 \u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24\n(quoting id., at 750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nments)); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 809, n. 13\n(1997) (leaving open \u201c \u2018the possibility that some applica\u00ad\ntions of the [New York prohibition on assisted suicide]\nmay impose an intolerable intrusion on the patient\u2019s free\u00ad\ndom\u2019 \u201d).

S., at 742\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments).\n   As this discussion reflects, to acknowledge that the task\nof construing the liberty clause requires judgment is not to\nsay that it is a license for unbridled judicial lawmaking.\nTo the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discre\u00ad\ntion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful\naccountability.\n                             IV\n   The question in this case, then, is not whether the Sec\u00ad\nond Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever\nthat right\u2019s precise contours) applies to the States because\nthe Amendment has been incorporated into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. It has not been. The question,\nrather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti\u00ad\ntioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth\nAmendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to\nanswer that question, we need to determine, first, the\nnature of the right that has been asserted and, second,\nwhether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment\n\u201cliberty.\u201d Even accepting the Court\u2019s holding in Heller, it\nremains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear\narms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable\nagainst the States, or that only part of the right is so\nenforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.

If that conclusion were wrong, then petitioners\u2019 \u201cincor\u00ad\nporation\u201d claim clearly would fail, as they would hold no right against\nthe Federal Government to be free from regulations such as the ones\nthey challenge. Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of\ntheir amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been\ndecided\u2014indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist\u2014we\nwould still have an obligation to address petitioners\u2019 Fourteenth\n28                   MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nin this case that some part of the Heller right applies to\nthe States, and then to find in later cases that other parts\nof the right also apply, or apply on different terms.\n   As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners\nhave asserted is the \u201cright to possess a functional, per\u00ad\nsonal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.\u201d\nComplaint \u00b634, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows resi\u00ad\ndents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are\nregistered, but it generally prohibits the possession of\nhandguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short\u00ad\nbarreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a78\u201320\u2013\n050 (2009).27 Petitioners\u2019 complaint centered on their\ndesire to keep a handgun at their domicile\u2014it references\nthe \u201chome\u201d in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint \u00b6\u00b63\u2013\n4, 11\u201330, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19\u201326\u2014as did\ntheir supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,\n49\u201352, 54\u201356. Petitioners now frame the question that\nconfronts us as \u201c[w]hether the Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\nor Due Process Clauses.\u201d Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it\nis our duty \u201cto focus on the allegations in the complaint to\ndetermine how petitioner describes the constitutional\nright at stake,\u201d Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the\ngravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a\nhandgun or other firearm of one\u2019s choosing in the home.\n   Petitioners\u2019 framing of their complaint tracks the\nCourt\u2019s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained\nsome dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAmendment claim.\n   27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that\n\nmay raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)\n(quoting Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u20131 (2007), 27\u20131\u20131\n(2009)). The Court, however, declined to grant certiorari on the Na\u00ad\ntional Rifle Association\u2019s challenge to the Oak Park restrictions.\nChicago is the only defendant in this case.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). But the\nHeller plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an oper\u00ad\nable firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see id., at\n___ (slip op., at 2, and n. 2), and the Court\u2019s opinion was\nbookended by reminders that its holding was limited to\nthat one issue, id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord,\nante, at 44 (plurality opinion). The distinction between\nthe liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the\nSecond Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore\nevanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even\nif both rights have the logical potential to extend further,\nupon \u201cfuture evaluation,\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem\u00ad\nplating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro\u00ad\nceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.\n   Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of\nfirearm in the home, petitioners\u2019 argument has real\nforce.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the\nhouse is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib\u00ad\nerty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to\ndecisions about the education and upbringing of one\u2019s\nchildren. For it is the kind of decision that may have\nprofound consequences for every member of the family,\nand for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep\na handgun, heads of households must ask themselves\nwhether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of\ndeliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or\nserious injury, not only to residents of the home but to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago\u2019s registra\u00ad\n\ntion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate\nthe Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make\nno effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or\nthat they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have\nasserted.\n30                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nothers as well. Millions of Americans have answered this\nquestion in the affirmative, not infrequently because they\nbelieve they have an inalienable right to do so\u2014because\nthey consider it an aspect of \u201cthe supreme human dignity\nof being master of one\u2019s fate rather than a ward of the\nState,\u201d Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been\nbased, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs\nthat are an aspect of individual autonomy the government\nmay not control.29\n  Bolstering petitioners\u2019 claim, our law has long recog\u00ad\nnized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary\nin modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law\u00ad\nrence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445\nU. S. 573, 585\u2013590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.\n557, 565\u2013568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\nConsequently, we have long accorded special deference to\nthe privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a\nmagnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark\u00ad\nens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog\u00ad\nnized a \u201cright of habitation,\u201d 4 Commentaries *223, and\nopined that \u201cevery man\u2019s house is looked upon by the law\nto be his castle of defence and asylum,\u201d 3 id., at *288.\nHeller carried forward this legacy, observing that \u201cthe\nneed for defense of self, family, and property is most\nacute\u201d in one\u2019s abode, and celebrating \u201cthe right of law\u00ad\nabiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of\nhearth and home.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,\n63).\n  While the individual\u2019s interest in firearm possession is\nthus heightened in the home, the State\u2019s corresponding\ninterest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 Members of my generation, at least, will recall the many passionate\n\nstatements of this view made by the distinguished actor, Charlton\nHeston.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ngenerally has a lesser basis for regulating private as com\u00ad\npared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home\ngenerally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as com\u00ad\npared to firearms taken outside. The historical case for\nregulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many\nStates have for many years imposed stricter, and less\ncontroversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on\ntheir domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at\n54) (noting that \u201cthe majority of the 19th-century courts to\nconsider the question held that prohibitions on carrying\nconcealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend\u00ad\nment or state analogues\u201d); English v. State, 35 Tex. 473,\n478\u2013479 (1871) (observing that \u201calmost, if not every one of\nthe States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carry\u00ad\ning of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,\u201d and\nlambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as\n\u201clittle short of ridiculous\u201d); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defend\u00ad\ning the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.\nL. Rev. 1278, 1321\u20131336 (2009).\n   It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal\nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home\nwould be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to\nadminister. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal\nuncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of\nimposing a national rule on the States in this area for the\nfirst time in United States history, the Court could at least\nmoderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the\nStates by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  30 See  Municipal Respondents\u2019 Brief 20, n. 11 (stating that at least\n156 Second Amendment challenges were brought in time between\nHeller\u2019s issuance and brief\u2019s filing); Brady Center Brief 3 (stating that\nover 190 Second Amendment challenges were brought in first 18\nmonths since Heller); Brief for Villages of Winnetka and Skokie, Illi\u00ad\nnois, et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (stating that, in wake of Heller, munici\u00ad\npalities have \u201crepealed longstanding handgun laws to avoid costly\nlitigation\u201d).\n32                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbounded in scope.\n  In their briefs to this Court, several amici have sought\nto bolster petitioners\u2019 claim still further by invoking a\nright to individual self-defense.31 As petitioners note, the\nHeller majority discussed this subject extensively and\nremarked that \u201c[t]he inherent right of self-defense has\nbeen central to the Second Amendment right.\u201d 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were\nto try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of\ndefending themselves from imminent physical threats, or\nto deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re\u00ad\nsponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi\u00ad\ncant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process right to be spared such untenable\ndilemmas is a serious one.32\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 See, e.g., Brief for Professors of Philosophy, Criminology, Law, and\nOther Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement\nEducators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29\u201345; Brief\nfor 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12\u201331.\n  32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,\n\nhowever, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self\u00ad\ndefense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi\u00ad\nnal Law Defenses \u00a7132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly\nan interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And\nthe States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this\ninterest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and\namounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of\naggressors, the availability of the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d and so forth. See\nBrief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus\nCuriae 9\u201321; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201319; 2\nW. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a710.4, pp. 142\u2013160 (2d ed. 2003).\nSuch variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist\nsystem, as the States and localities select different rules in light of\ndifferent priorities, customs, and conditions.\n  As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of\nself-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We\nhave generally understood Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty\u201d as some\u00ad\nthing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal\nright of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     33\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not\nasked that we establish a constitutional right to individual\nself-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court\nnor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor\ndo petitioners contend that the city of Chicago\u2014which,\nrecall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot\u00ad\nguns, and to keep them loaded\u2014has unduly burdened any\nsuch right. What petitioners have asked is that we \u201cincor\u00ad\nporate\u201d the Second Amendment and thereby establish a\nconstitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,\nto keep a handgun in the home.\n  Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic\u00ad\ning self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of\naction is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and\nutilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that\naction. And while some might favor handguns, it is not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngovernment tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere\nwith (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces\u00ad\nsary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy\nthat, in entering civil society and gaining \u201cthe advantages of mutual\ncommerce\u201d and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,\nto a significant degree, \u201cthat wild and savage liberty\u201d one possessed in\nthe state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7128, pp. 63\u201364 (J.\nGough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power \u201cto do whatever he\nthinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,\u201d but this \u201che gives\nup when he joins in a . . . particular political society\u201d); Green v. Biddle,\n8 Wheat. 1, 63 (1823) (\u201cIt is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of\nhis natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the\nblessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty\nis well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice\u201d).\nSome strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the\nright to armed self-defense. See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early\nAmerican Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici\nCuriae 6\u201313 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because\nthere may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self\u00ad\ndefense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric\u00ad\ntions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional\nright to the same.\n34                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self\u00ad\ndefense, and nothing in petitioners\u2019 argument turns on\nthat being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense\nimplies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm\npresupposes not only controversial judgments about the\nstrength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but\nalso controversial assumptions about the likely effects\nof making that type of firearm more broadly available. It\nis a very long way from the proposition that the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of\nself-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban\nhandguns.33\n  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in\nparticular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly\nrelevant to an assessment of petitioners\u2019 asserted right,\nthere is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.\nThe question we must decide is whether the interest in\nkeeping in the home a firearm of one\u2019s choosing\u2014a hand\u00ad\ngun, for petitioners\u2014is one that is \u201ccomprised within the\nterm liberty\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment.

S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly\n\ndistinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly\nmisconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of\npersonal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state\nmilitias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with\ntyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,\nnot with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear\nthat self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and\nsubstance of the Amendment\u2019s guarantee. The Court struck down the\nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand\u00ad\nguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for\nthat purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201358). And the Court\u2019s\ncommon-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the\nright, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54\u201355), had little to do with self-defense.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  35\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                             V\n   While I agree with the Court that our substantive due\nprocess cases offer a principled basis for holding that\npetitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable\nfiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a\nbetter reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.\nI would not foreclose the possibility that a particular\nplaintiff\u2014say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous\nneighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a\nlong gun\u2014may have a cognizable liberty interest in pos\u00ad\nsessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners\u2019\nbroader submission. A number of factors, taken together,\nlead me to this conclusion.\n   First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela\u00ad\ntionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners\ndefend their families and property from intruders, they\ncan help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent\nvictims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far\nfrom hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of\nour communities. Amici calculate that approximately one\nmillion Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire\nin the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer\ndisproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand\u00ad\nguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some\nhomeowners may prefer handguns because of their small\nsize, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals\nwill value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32\u201333).\nIn recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more\nthan four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34 Brady  Center Brief 11 (extrapolating from Government statistics);\nsee also Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 6\u20137 (reporting estimated social cost of firearm-related violence\nof $100 billion per year).\n36                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nall murders nationwide.35\n   Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from\nparticular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides\nof the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as\nwell as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique\npotential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to\ndestabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and\nbearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in\nbeing and feeling safe from armed violence. And while\ngranting you the right to own a handgun might make you\nsafer on any given day\u2014assuming the handgun\u2019s marginal\ncontribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri\u00ad\nbution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis\u00ad\nchief\u2014it may make you and the community you live in\nless safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand\u00ad\nguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ\u00ad\nratically elected legislature to take such concerns into\naccount in considering what sorts of regulations would\nbest serve the public welfare.\n   The practical impact of various gun-control measures\nmay be highly controversial, but this basic insight should\nnot be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive\nthreat to the social order\u2014and that reasonable restric\u00ad\ntions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur\u00ad\nden on one\u2019s personal liberty\u2014is as old as the Republic.\nAs THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a\nfoundational premise of modern government that the\nState holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: \u201cA basic\nstep in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword\nout of private hands and turn it over to an organized\ngovernment, acting on behalf of all the people.\u201d Robertson\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   35 Bogus, Gun Control and America\u2019s Cities: Public Policy and Poli\u00ad\n\ntics, 1 Albany Govt.

The same holds true for the hand\u00ad\ngun. The power a man has in the state of nature \u201cof doing\nwhatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself\nand the rest of mankind, he gives up,\u201d to a significant\nextent, \u201cto be regulated by laws made by the society.\u201d\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7129, p. 64\n(J. Gough ed. 1947).\n   Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and\nbear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does\nnot dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has\nlong afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,\nwe have never understood that principle to \u201cinfring[e]\nupon\u201d the authority of the States to proscribe certain\ninherently dangerous items, for \u201c[i]n such cases, compel\u00ad\nling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi\u00ad\nvidual to possess those materials.\u201d Stanley, 394 U. S., at\n568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home\nmay not stay in the home. Even if the government has a\nweaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire\u00ad\narms as compared to public carriage\u2014and even if a blan\u00ad\nket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might\ntherefore be unconstitutional\u2014the line between the two is\na porous one. A state or local legislature may determine\nthat a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon\nis necessary to police that line.\n   Second, the right to possess a firearm of one\u2019s choosing\nis different in kind from the liberty interests we have\nrecognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the\nplethora of substantive due process cases that have been\ndecided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none\nthat holds, states, or even suggests that the term \u201cliberty\u201d\nencompasses either the common-law right of self-defense\nor a right to keep and bear arms.

Nevertheless, it does not\nappear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or\nany particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of\nautonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace\noffers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper\u00ad\nfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici\nmake such a contention. Petitioners\u2019 claim is not the kind\nof substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,\njudicially enforced national standard is presumptively\nappropriate.36\n   Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue\nmay be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish\nto acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain\nfirearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the\npossession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as\nproperty interests subject to definition and regulation by\nthe States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.\nFlorida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 1) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\u201cGener\u00ad\nally speaking, state law defines property interests\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  36 JUSTICE SCALIA worries that there is no \u201cobjective\u201d way to decide\nwhat is essential to a \u201cliberty-filled\u201d existence: Better, then, to ignore\nsuch messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people\u2019s\nlives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the\nterm \u201cliberty,\u201d however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.\nSubstantive due process analysis does not require any \u201cpolitical\u201d\njudgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma\u00ad\ntive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of \u201cliberty,\u201d in the present day, is to provide\nreasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE\nSCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to \u201cthe\nright to keep and bear arms,\u201d without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is\nwhat the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government\ninfringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment liberty interest asserted by petitioners\u2014the interest in keeping a\nfirearm of one\u2019s choosing in the home\u2014is not necessarily coextensive\nwith the Second Amendment right.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      39\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nUnder that tradition, Chicago\u2019s ordinance is unexcep\u00ad\ntional.37\n   The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dis\u00ad\nsimilar from those we have recognized in its capacity to\nundermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the\nBill of Rights\u2019 procedural guarantees may place \u201crestric\u00ad\ntions on law enforcement\u201d that have \u201ccontroversial public\nsafety implications.\u201d Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see\nalso ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica\u00ad\ntions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant\u2019s invo\u00ad\ncation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,\nor to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any\nthreat. The defendant\u2019s liberty interest is constrained by\n(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.\nThe link between handgun ownership and public safety is\nmuch tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the\nhandgun\u2019s bullets are the violence.\n   Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound\noffense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the\npractices of another religion, or a gay couple\u2019s choice to\nhave intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho\u00ad\nlogical, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers\n\nto \u201cproperty\u201d as well as \u201cliberty.\u201d Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9\u201310, n. 6 (opinion\nof SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)\n(plurality opinion), I alone viewed \u201cthe critical question\u201d as \u201cwhether\nEast Cleveland\u2019s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on\nappellant\u2019s right to use her own property as she sees fit,\u201d id., at 513\n(opinion concurring in judgment). In that case, unlike in this case, the\nasserted property right was coextensive with a right to organize one\u2019s\nfamily life, and I could find \u201cno precedent\u201d for the ordinance at issue,\nwhich \u201cexclude[d] any of an owner\u2019s relatives from the group of persons\nwho may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.\u201d Id., at 520. I am\nopen to property claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. This case\njust involves a weak one. And ever since the Court \u201cincorporated\u201d the\nmore specific property protections of the Takings Clause in 1897, see\nChicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S. 226, substantive due process doctrine\nhas focused on liberty.\n40                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety\nof any other person.38 Firearms may be used to kill an\u00ad\nother person. If a legislature\u2019s response to dangerous\nweapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi\u00ad\nviduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so\non the basis of more than the majority\u2019s \u201c \u2018own moral\ncode,\u2019 \u201d Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505\nU. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be\nmisguided, gun control is an area in which it \u201cis quite\nwrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy\nmutually exclusive zones\u2014that as one expands, the other\nmust contract.\u201d Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.\n   Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,\nincluding those that share our British heritage, undercuts\nthe notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms\nis intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries\nplace restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of\nfirearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in\nthis Nation. See Municipal Respondents\u2019 Brief 21\u201323\n(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,\nDenmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That\nthe United States is an international outlier in the per\u00ad\nmissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that\nour laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court\nmay not need to assume responsibility for making our\nlaws still more permissive.\n   Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in\nmany relevant respects, including their problems with\nviolent crime and the traditional role that firearms have\nplayed in their societies. But they are not so different\nfrom the United States that we ought to dismiss their\nexperience entirely. Cf. ante, at 34\u201335 (plurality opinion);\nante, at 10\u201311 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).

While the \u201cAmeri\u00ad\ncan perspective\u201d must always be our focus, ante, at 37, 44\n(plurality opinion), it is silly\u2014indeed, arrogant\u2014to think\nwe have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of\npeople beyond our borders.\n   Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the\nAmendments that surround it, with the consequence that\nits inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful\nbut positively harmful to petitioners\u2019 claim. Generally, the\ninclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points\ntoward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance\nand ought to be enforceable against the States. But the\nSecond Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as\nannounced by its peculiar opening clause.39 Even accept\u00ad\ning the Heller Court\u2019s view that the Amendment protects\nan individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected\nfrom militia service, it remains undeniable that \u201cthe pur\u00ad\npose for which the right was codified\u201d was \u201cto prevent\nelimination of the militia.\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 26); see also United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174,\n178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted \u201c[w]ith obvi\u00ad\nous purpose to assure the continuation and render possible\nthe effectiveness of [militia] forces\u201d). It was the States, not\nprivate persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second\nAmendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the Heller\nCourt\u2019s efforts to write the Second Amendment\u2019s preamble\nout of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the\nstructural function of protecting the States from en\u00ad\ncroachment by an overreaching Federal Government.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 The Second Amendment provides: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being\n\nnecessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n42                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Second Amendment, in other words, \u201cis a federal\u00ad\nism provision,\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,\n542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the\nsovereign States, and its logic therefore \u201cresists\u201d incorpo\u00ad\nration by a federal court against the States. Ibid. No one\nsuggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that\npowers not given to the Federal Government remain with\n\u201cthe States,\u201d applies to the States; such a reading would\nborder on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment\nexists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state\ngovernance. The Second Amendment is no different.40\n   The Court is surely correct that Americans\u2019 conceptions\nof the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a\nmore individualistic direction; that Members of the Recon\u00ad\nstruction Congress were urgently concerned about the\nsafety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members\nbelieved that, following ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the\nStates. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the\nconclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cincorporated\u201d\nthe Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or\npostenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that\nthe text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about\nthe Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substan\u00ad\ntial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction\nCongress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   40 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion, this point is perfectly\n\ncompatible with my opinion for the Court in Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1 (2004). Cf. ante, at 11. Like the Court\nitself, I have never agreed with JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 view that the Estab\u00ad\nlishment Clause is a federalism provision. But I agree with his under\u00ad\nlying logic: If a clause in the Bill of Rights exists to safeguard federal\u00ad\nism interests, then it makes little sense to \u201cincorporate\u201d it. JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s further suggestion that I ought to have revisited the Estab\u00ad\nlishment Clause debate in this opinion, ibid., is simply bizarre.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

The Court\u2019s\nnarrative largely elides these facts. The complications\nthey raise show why even the most dogged historical\ninquiry into the \u201cfundamentality\u201d of the Second Amend\u00ad\nment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial\njudgment\u2014and therefore judicial discretion\u2014every step of\nthe way.\n  I accept that the evolution in Americans\u2019 understanding\nof the Second Amendment may help shed light on the\nquestion whether a right to keep and bear arms is com\u00ad\nprised within Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty.\u201d But the\nreasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability\nof militiamen to keep muskets available for military use\nwhen our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the\nReconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the\nfreedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited\nbearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a\ncrime-infested metropolis today.

The plurality insists that\nthe Reconstruction-era evidence shows the right to bear arms was\nregarded as \u201ca substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.\u201d\nAnte, at 33. That may be so, but it does not resolve the question\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause was origi\u00ad\nnally understood to encompass a right to keep and bear arms, or\nwhether it ought to be so construed now.\n44                 MCDONALD v.

The idea that States may\nplace substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear\narms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more\nentrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution\nprotects any such right.

See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 20\u201325) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Chicago\u2019s\nhandgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers.

But the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the\nmatter before us\u2014as evidenced by the groundbreaking\nnature of today\u2019s fractured decision\u2014and this Court lacks\nboth the technical capacity and the localized expertise to\nassess \u201cthe wisdom, need, and propriety\u201d of most gun\u00ad\ncontrol measures.

See post, at 12\u201315. The plurality\u2019s\n\u201cassuranc[e]\u201d that \u201cincorporation does not imperil every\nlaw regulating firearms,\u201d ante, at 40, provides only modest\ncomfort. For it is also an admission of just how many\ndifferent types of regulations are potentially implicated by\ntoday\u2019s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court\u2019s initial\nattempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.\nThe practical significance of the proposition that \u201cthe\nSecond Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,\u201d\nante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by\nthis Court over many, many years.\n  Furthermore, and critically, the Court\u2019s imposition of a\nnational standard is still more unwise because the elected\nbranches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of\nsafeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.\nThe strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con\u00ad\nnection with its status in the democratic process. And in\nthis case, no one disputes \u201cthat opponents of [gun] control\nhave considerable political power and do not seem to be at\na systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,\u201d or\nthat \u201cthe widespread commitment to an individual right to\nown guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin\u00ad\nion.

Indeed, there is a good deal of\nevidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers\ntend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views\nexpressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K.

If a particular State or locality has\nenacted some \u201cimprovident\u201d gun-control measures, as\npetitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent\nreason to infer that the mistake will not \u201ceventually be\nrectified by the democratic process.\u201d Vance v.

Neither petitioners nor those most zealously commit\u00ad\nted to their views represent a group or a claim that is\nliable to receive unfair treatment at the hands of the\nmajority. On the contrary, petitioners\u2019 views are sup\u00ad\nported by powerful participants in the legislative process.\nPetitioners have given us no reason to believe that the\ninterest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special\nneed for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are\nmore qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people\u2019s\nelected representatives. Having failed to show why their\nasserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered\nliberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political\narena, they have failed to show why \u201cthe word liberty in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u201d should be \u201cheld to prevent\nthe natural outcome of a dominant opinion\u201d about how to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  48 Likewise, no one contends that those interested in personal self\u00ad\ndefense\u2014every American, presumably\u2014face any particular disadvan\u00ad\ntage in the political process.

S., at 76 (Holmes, J.,\ndissenting).\n                             VI\n  The preceding sections have already addressed many of\nthe points made by JUSTICE SCALIA in his concurrence.\nBut in light of that opinion\u2019s fixation on this one, it is\nappropriate to say a few words about JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\nbroader claim: that his preferred method of substantive\ndue process analysis, a method \u201cthat makes the traditions\nof our people paramount,\u201d ante, at 1, is both more re\u00ad\nstrained and more facilitative of democracy than the\nmethod I have outlined. Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ncritique does not have nearly as much force as does his\nrhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,\ncomes with its own profound difficulties.\n  Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an \u201cobjective,\u201d\n\u201cneutral\u201d method of substantive due process analysis,\nante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un\u00ad\nder the \u201chistorically focused\u201d approach he advocates, ante,\nat 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever\ngets to the history. At what level of generality should one\nframe the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.\nWhat does it mean for a right to be \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this\nNation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 3 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will\nthat proposition be tested? Which types of sources will\ncount, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre\u00ad\ngated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these\nquestions. There is not even a theory\u2014at least, JUSTICE\nSCALIA provides none\u2014of how to go about answering\nthem.\n  Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for\nsubstantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has\nstated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply\n52                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrooted in American tradition, \u201cbut it must also be implicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Lawrence, 539 U. S., at\n593, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that\ntest requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment\u2014the\nsame multifaceted evaluation of the right\u2019s contours and\nconsequences\u2014that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur\u00ad\nrence today.\n   So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel\ninsight that history is not an objective science, and that its\nuse can therefore \u201cpoint in any direction the judges favor,\u201d\nante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the\npoint was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,\nJUSTICE SCALIA remains \u201coblivious to the fact that [the\nconcept of \u2018tradition\u2019] can be as malleable and elusive as\n\u2018liberty\u2019 itself.\u201d Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting\nopinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a\ndiscrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of\nthe Second Amendment, the evidence often points in\ndifferent directions. The historian must choose which\npieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try\nto assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,\nJUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much\nearlier and later in time than the Second Amendment\nitself, see, e.g., 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4\u20135) (consult\u00ad\ning late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans\nwould have read the Amendment\u2019s preamble in 1791); I\nfocused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the\nAmendment\u2019s drafting and ratification.49 No mechanical\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  49 See Heller, 554 U.

At least with the former sort\nof question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;\nthe temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela\u00ad\ntively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on\nwhat sorts of authorities merit consideration.          With\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s approach to substantive due process,\nthese guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the\nentire landscape of American law as it has evolved\nthrough time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, e.g.,\nLawrence, 539 U. S., at 596 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (dis\u00ad\ncussing \u201c \u2018ancient roots\u2019 \u201d of proscriptions against sodomy\n(quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, 192 (1986)),\npursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never\nbeen defined. In conducting this rudderless, panoramic\ntour of American legal history, the judge has more than\nample opportunity to \u201clook over the heads of the crowd\nand pick out [his] friends,\u201d Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.\n551, 617 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   My point is not to criticize judges\u2019 use of history in\ngeneral or to suggest that it always generates indetermi\u00ad\nnate answers; I have already emphasized that historical\nstudy can discipline as well as enrich substantive due\nprocess analysis.     My point is simply that JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity\nand restraint as its cardinal\u2014and, it seems, only\u2014virtues,\nis unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number\nof subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori\u00ad\ncal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.\nAt least with my approach, the judge\u2019s cards are laid on\nthe table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must\n54                       MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                           STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nexercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti\u00ad\ntutional question to which the text provides no clear an\u00ad\nswer, there is always some amount of discretion; our\nconstitutional system has always depended on judges\u2019\nfilling in the document\u2019s vast open spaces.50 But there is\nalso transparency.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s approach is even less restrained in\nanother sense: It would effect a major break from our case\nlaw outside of the \u201cincorporation\u201d area. JUSTICE SCALIA\ndoes not seem troubled by the fact that his method is\nlargely inconsistent with the Court\u2019s canonical substantive\ndue process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,\nand Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920\u2019s, to Griswold, 381\nU. S. 479, in the 1960\u2019s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the\n2000\u2019s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso\u00ad\nnance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on\nwhich the American people have relied for decades.\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am\nleft to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation\u2019s\nconstitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to\nthe values and commitments of the American people, as\nthey stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov\u00ad\ning, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as\nequality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter\u00ad\nracial marriage was hardly \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in American\ntradition. Racial segregation and subordination were\ndeeply rooted. The Court\u2019s substantive due process hold\u00ad\ning was nonetheless correct\u2014and we should be wary of\nany interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it\nwas not.\n   Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s method invites not only bad history, but\nalso bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,\nin evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 50 Indeed,   this is truly one of our most deeply rooted legal traditions.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           55\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give\nhistory significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s position is\ncloser to my own than he apparently feels comfortable\nacknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history\ndispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially\nlittle sense to answer questions like whether the right to\nbear arms is \u201cfundamental\u201d by focusing only on the past,\ngiven that both the practical significance and the public\nunderstandings of such a right often change as society\nchanges. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at\none time firearm possession contributed substantially to\npersonal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth\u00ad\ning, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have\nbeen reasonable to constitutionalize the right?\n   The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical\nviews be less than completely clear or informative, but\nthey can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri\u00ad\ncans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not\nto be true. Some practices that many Americans believed\nto be consistent with the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of\nliberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon\u00ad\nsistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con\u00ad\nstitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal\nexistence. Although we should always \u201cpa[y] a decent\nregard to the opinions of former times,\u201d it \u201cis not the glory\nof the people of America\u201d to have \u201csuffered a blind venera\u00ad\ntion for antiquity.\u201d The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal\njudges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to\nthe Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious\nlanguage, in an effort to transform foundational legal\ncommitments into narrow rules of decision.\n   As for \u201cthe democratic process,\u201d ante, at 14, 15, a\nmethod that looks exclusively to history can easily do more\nharm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s supposedly objective analysis is to vest\n56                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfederal judges\u2014ultimately a majority of the judges on this\nCourt\u2014with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area\nin which they have no special qualifications, and in which\nthe give-and-take of the political process has functioned\neffectively for decades. Why this \u201cintrudes much less upon\nthe democratic process,\u201d ante, at 14, than an approach\nthat would defer to the democratic process on the regula\u00ad\ntion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I\ncannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s view, con\u00ad\nstitutes an \u201cintrusion.\u201d\n   It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ\u00ad\nracy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s critique. Because\nvery few of us would welcome a system in which majorities\nor powerful interest groups always get their way. Under\nour constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a\njudicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have\noutlined\u2014an approach that investigates both the intrinsic\nnature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi\u00ad\ncance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its\nreasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con\u00ad\nstraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,\nand that is willing to protect some rights even if they have\nnot already received uniform protection from the elected\nbranches\u2014has the capacity to improve, rather than\n\u201c[im]peril,\u201d ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on\njudges\u2019 exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al\u00ad\nways has, and as it always will.\n                             VII\n  The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in\nthe Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the\nCourt\u2019s decision to enforce that right against the States.\nBy its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the\nStates; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals\noutside of the militia context. The Second Amendment\nwas adopted to protect the States from federal encroach\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           57\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been\nunderstood by the Court to have \u201cincorporated\u201d the entire\nBill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about\ntoday\u2019s outcome.\n   Although the Court\u2019s decision in this case might be seen\nas a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse\u00ad\nquences could prove far more destructive\u2014quite liter\u00ad\nally\u2014to our Nation\u2019s communities and to our constitu\u00ad\ntional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment\nright identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth\nAmendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the\nhome. But neither the \u201cassurances\u201d provided by the plu\u00ad\nrality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in\nits opinion should obscure the reality that today\u2019s ruling\nmarks a dramatic change in our law\u2014or that the Justices\nwho have joined it have brought to bear an awesome\namount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre\u00ad\nsented by this case.\n   I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set\nout at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol\u00ad\nogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al\u00ad\nthough impressively argued, the majority\u2019s decision to\noverturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent\nand to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is\nnot, in my judgment, built \u201cupon respect for the teachings\nof history, solid recognition of the basic values that under\u00ad\nlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles\nthat the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers\nhave played in establishing and preserving American\nfreedoms.\u201d Griswold, 381 U.

Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the\ncarrying of arms for that purpose often puts others\u2019 lives\nat risk. See ante, at 35\u201337. And the use of arms for pri\nvate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional\nprotection from state regulation. See ante, at 44\u201351.\n  The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion\nupon \u201csubstantive due process\u201d concerns. Rather, it di\nrects its attention to this Court\u2019s \u201cincorporation\u201d prece\ndents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to\nprivate self-defense is \u201cfundamental\u201d so that it applies to\nthe States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,\nat 11\u201319.\n  I shall therefore separately consider the question of\n\u201cincorporation.\u201d I can find nothing in the Second Amend\nment\u2019s text, history, or underlying rationale that could\nwarrant characterizing it as \u201cfundamental\u201d insofar as it\nseeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri\n2                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvate self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification\nfor interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate\nregulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from\ndemocratically elected legislatures to courts or from the\nStates to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment does not \u201cincorporate\u201d\nthe Second Amendment\u2019s right \u201cto keep and bear Arms.\u201d\nAnd I consequently dissent.\n                               I\n    The Second Amendment says: \u201cA well regulated Militia,\nbeing necessary to the security of a free State, the right of\nthe people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.\n___ (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial\nconsensus that the Second Amendment was primarily\nconcerned with the need to maintain a \u201cwell regulated\nMilitia.\u201d See id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20133, and n. 2, 38\u201345); United States v. Miller, 307 U. S.\n174, 178 (1939). Although the Court acknowledged that\n\u201cthe threat that the new Federal Government would de\nstroy the citizens\u2019 militia by taking away their arms was\nthe reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti\ntution,\u201d the Court asserted that \u201cindividual self defense\n. . . was the central component of the right itself.\u201d Heller,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added). The\nCourt went on to hold that the Second Amendment re\nstricted Congress\u2019 power to regulate handguns used for\nself-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the\nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s ban on the possession of handguns\nin the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).\n    The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon\nits reading of history. But the relevant history in Heller\nwas far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed\nwith the majority\u2019s historical analysis. And subsequent\nscholarly writing reveals why disputed history provides\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntreacherous ground on which to build decisions written by\njudges who are not expert at history.\n   Since Heller, historians, scholars, and judges have con\ntinued to express the view that the Court\u2019s historical\naccount was flawed. See, e.g., Konig, Why the Second\nAmendment Has a Preamble: Original Public Meaning\nand the Political Culture of Written Constitutions in\nRevolutionary America, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1295 (2009);\nFinkelman, It Really Was About a Well Regulated Militia,\n59 Syracuse L. Rev. 267 (2008); P. Charles, The Second\nAmendment: The Intent and Its Interpretation by the\nStates and the Supreme Court (2009); Merkel, The District\nof Columbia v. Heller and Antonin Scalia\u2019s Perverse Sense\nof Originalism, 13 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 349 (2009);\nKozuskanich, Originalism in a Digital Age: An Inquiry\ninto the Right to Bear Arms, 29 J.

Rev. 171 (2008).\n   Consider as an example of these critiques an amici brief\nfiled in this case by historians who specialize in the study\nof the English Civil Wars. They tell us that Heller misun\nderstood a key historical point. See Brief for Eng\nlish/Early American Historians as Amici Curiae (hereinaf\nter English Historians\u2019 Brief) (filed by 21 professors at\nleading universities in the United States, United King\ndom, and Australia). Heller\u2019s conclusion that \u201cindividual\nself-defense\u201d was \u201cthe central component\u201d of the Second\nAmendment\u2019s right \u201cto keep and bear Arms\u201d rested upon\nits view that the Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right\u201d\nthat had \u201cnothing whatever to do with service in a mili\n4                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntia.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19\u201320). That view in\nturn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having\ndescribed the right as \u201c \u2018the right of having and using arms\nfor self-preservation and defence,\u2019 \u201d which reflected the\nprovision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that\ngave the King\u2019s Protestant \u201c \u2018subjects\u2019 \u201d the right to \u201c \u2018have\nArms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as\nallowed by law.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19\u201320) (quoting 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140\n(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in\n3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the\nmajority, understood that right \u201cas permitting a citizen to\n\u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in\nhis behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.\u2019 \u201d 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting St. George Tucker, 1\nBlackstone\u2019s Commentaries 145\u2013146, n. 42 (1803)).\n   The historians now tell us, however, that the right to\nwhich Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but every\nthing, to do with the militia. As properly understood at\nthe time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim,\nthe right to bear arms \u201censured that Parliament had the\npower\u201d to arm the citizenry: \u201cto defend the realm\u201d in the\ncase of a foreign enemy, and to \u201csecure the right of \u2018self\npreservation,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cself-defense,\u201d should \u201cthe sovereign\nusurp the English Constitution.\u201d English Historians\u2019 Brief\n3, 8\u201313, 23\u201324 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of\nRight says that private persons can possess guns only \u201cas\nallowed by law.\u201d See id., at 20\u201324. Moreover, when\nBlackstone referred to \u201c \u2018the right of having and using\narms for self-preservation and defence,\u2019 \u201d he was referring\nto the right of the people \u201cto take part in the militia to\ndefend their political liberties,\u201d and to the right of Parlia\nment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even\nwhen the King sought to deny it that power. Id., at 4, 24\u2013\n27 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140). Nor can\nthe historians find any convincing reason to believe that\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Framers had something different in mind than what\nBlackstone himself meant. Compare Heller, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 21\u201322) with English Historians\u2019 Brief 28\u201340.\nThe historians concede that at least one historian takes a\ndifferent position, see id., at 7, but the Court, they imply,\nwould lose a poll taken among professional historians of\nthis period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.\n   If history, and history alone, is what matters, why\nwould the Court not now reconsider Heller in light of these\nmore recently published historical views? See Leegin\nCreative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S.\n877, 923\u2013924 (2007) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that\nstare decisis interests are at their lowest with respect to\nrecent and erroneous constitutional decisions that create\nunworkable legal regimes); Citizens United v. Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 47)\n(listing similar factors); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S. 38, 99 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201c[S]tare\ndecisis may bind courts as to matters of law, but it cannot\nbind them as to matters of history\u201d). At the least, where\nHeller\u2019s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex\ntend its applicability?\n   My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the\nreefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges\nwho place virtually determinative weight upon historical\nconsiderations. In my own view, the Court should not look\nto history alone but to other factors as well\u2014above all, in\ncases where the history is so unclear that the experts\nthemselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,\nconsider the basic values that underlie a constitutional\nprovision and their contemporary significance. And it\nshould examine as well the relevant consequences and\npractical justifications that might, or might not, warrant\nremoving an important question from the democratic\ndecisionmaking process. See ante, at 16\u201320 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively\n6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhistorical approach).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   In my view, taking Heller as a given, the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, to incorporate the\nprivate self-defense right the majority must show that the\nright is, e.g., \u201cfundamental to the American scheme of\njustice,\u201d Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);\nsee ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)\n(finding that the right is \u201cfundamental\u201d and therefore\nincorporated). And this it fails to do.\n   The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost\nexclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.\nAnte, at 20\u201333. But to do so for incorporation purposes is\nboth wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points\nout, our society has historically made mistakes\u2014for ex\nample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century\nproperty rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting\nopinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,\nhistory often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,\nsupra; Part III, infra.\n   Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation\nquestion, has never stated that the historical status of a\nright is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court\nhas either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin\nions that the right in question has remained fundamental\nover time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410\n(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation\n\u201cinquiry must focus upon the function served\u201d by the right\nin question in \u201ccontemporary society\u201d (emphasis added));\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting\nthat the right in question \u201ccontinues to receive strong\nsupport\u201d); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1967) (same). And, indeed, neither of the parties before\nus in this case has asked us to employ the majority\u2019s his\ntory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67\u201369\n(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo\nrary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of\nChicago et al. 23\u201331 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)\n(looking to current state practices with respect to the\nright).\n   I thus think it proper, above all where history provides\nno clear answer, to look to other factors in considering\nwhether a right is sufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to remove it\nfrom the political process in every State. I would include\namong those factors the nature of the right; any contem\nporary disagreement about whether the right is funda\nmental; the extent to which incorporation will further\nother, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the\nextent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the\nConstitution\u2019s structural aims, including its division of\npowers among different governmental institutions (and\nthe people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,\nto further the Constitution\u2019s effort to ensure that the\ngovernment treats each individual with equal respect?\nWill it help maintain the democratic form of government\nthat the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora\ntion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu\ntion\u2019s efforts to create governmental institutions well\nsuited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?\n   Finally, I would take account of the Framers\u2019 basic\nreason for believing the Court ought to have the power of\njudicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that\npower to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,\nacting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a\npopular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey & J. McClellan\neds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (\u201cThis independence of the judges\nis equally requisite to guard the constitution and the\n8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,\nwhich\u201d can, at times, lead to \u201cserious oppressions of the\nminor part in the community\u201d). Judges, he thought, may\nfind it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the\nbasic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States\nv. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).\nThat being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu\nlar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case\nat hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).\n                               B\n   How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,\nI would apply them only to the private self-defense right\ndirectly at issue. After all, the Amendment\u2019s militia\nrelated purpose is primarily to protect States from federal\nregulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related\nregulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see\nalso Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War\nAmendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu\nmerous other institutions today help to safeguard the\nStates and the people from any serious threat of federal\ntyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?\nIt is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con\ncedes, has \u201clargely faded as a popular concern\u201d could\npossibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo\nration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.\nHence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot\nbe based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found\nto be more extensive Second Amendment rights.\n   For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self\ndefense right that the Court would incorporate has noth\ning to do with \u201cthe reason\u201d the Framers \u201ccodified\u201d the right\nto keep and bear arms \u201cin a written Constitution.\u201d 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller\nimmediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe\nless \u201cthe central component of the right.\u201d Ibid. In my\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nview, this is the historical equivalent of a claim that water\nruns uphill. See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the\nFramers\u2019 basic reasons for including language in the Con\nstitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid\ning about the contemporary importance of a right) than\nthe particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would\nhave then assigned to the words they used. And examina\ntion of the Framers\u2019 motivation tells us they did not think\nthe private armed self-defense right was of paramount\nimportance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu\ntion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (\u201c[T]o see the [Sec\nond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ\nual right to hunt, or protect one\u2019s home,\u201d would be \u201clike\nviewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as\nthe right of persons to meet to play bridge\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nRakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of\nOriginalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127\u2013128 (2000);\nBrief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu\ntional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22\u201333.\n   Further, there is no popular consensus that the private\nself-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The\nplurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case\nshow such a consensus, see ante, at 42\u201343, but, of course,\nnumerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora\ntion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms\nextensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the\nappropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement\nrests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the\nright essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the\nhome; the other side believes it essential to regulate the\nright in order to protect the lives of others attacked with\nguns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de\nvelop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of\nfirearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to\nbe, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, e.g.,\nSiegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitu\n10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntionalism in Heller, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201\u2013246 (2008).\n(Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in\nPart II\u2013B can be found in the Appendix, infra.)\n   Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incor\nporation of the private self-defense right will further any\nother or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of\nno argument that gun-control regulations target or are\npassed with the purpose of targeting \u201cdiscrete and insular\nminorities.\u201d Carolene Products Co., supra, at 153, n. 4;\nsee, e.g., ante, at 49\u201351 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Nor will\nincorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.\nUnlike the First Amendment\u2019s rights of free speech, free\npress, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense\nright does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic\nprocess that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, e.g.,\nWhitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment\u2019s religious\nprotections, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments\u2019 insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and\nthe Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection against cruel and\nunusual punishments, the private self-defense right does\nnot significantly seek to protect individuals who might\notherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the\nhands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by\nmany of these same Amendments, it does not involve\nmatters as to which judges possess a comparative exper\ntise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice\nsystem and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend\nment\u2019s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve\na matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself\nproperty belonging to a minority.\n   Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant\ndisruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak\ning authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution\u2019s\nability to further its objectives.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of\nthe right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi\ncant incursion on a traditional and important area of state\nconcern, altering the constitutional relationship between\nthe States and the Federal Government. Private gun\nregulation is the quintessential exercise of a State\u2019s \u201cpolice\npower\u201d\u2014i.e., the power to \u201cprotec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,\nhealth, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec\ntion of all property within the State,\u201d by enacting \u201call\nkinds of restraints and burdens\u201d on both \u201cpersons and\nproperty.\u201d Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 62 (1873)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long\nrecognized that the Constitution grants the States special\nauthority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting\nthat States have \u201cgreat latitude\u201d to use their police powers\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade\nago, we wrote that there is \u201cno better example of the police\npower\u201d than \u201cthe suppression of violent crime.\u201d United\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam\nples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative\njudgments in respect to the exercise of the police power\nare legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,\n270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,\n521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348\nU. S. 26, 32 (1954) (\u201cWe deal, in other words, with what\ntraditionally has been known as the police power. An\nattempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is\nfruitless . . .\u201d).\n   Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular\nstate gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri\ncally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better\nable than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala\nmeda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality\nopinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 180, 195\u2013196 (1997). And it may require this kind of\nanalysis in virtually every case.\n   Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor\nmally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help\nsave lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is\nconstitutional would thus almost always require the\nweighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against\nthe \u201cprimary concern of every government\u2014a concern for\nthe safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.\u201d United\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect\nto other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some\ntimes present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.\n444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City\nv. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403\u2013404 (2006) (Fourth Amend\nment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)\n(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But\nhere, this inquiry\u2014calling for the fine tuning of protective\nrules\u2014is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.\n   Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to\nanswer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.\nSuppose, for example, that after a gun regulation\u2019s adop\ntion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation\nwould the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this\nconclusion affected by the local recession which has left\nnumerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts\nthat led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective\nwas that police force to begin with? And did the regula\ntion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful\npurposes without affecting their possession by criminals?\n   Consider too that countless gun regulations of many\nshapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many\nlocal communities. Does the right to possess weapons for\nself-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To\nwork? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?\nHandguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngun semi-automatic? Where are different kinds of weap\nons likely needed? Does time-of-day matter? Does the\npresence of a child in the house matter? Does the pres\nence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police\nneed special rules permitting patdowns designed to find\nguns? When do registration requirements become severe\nto the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?\nWho can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior\ndrug offenders? Prior alcohol abusers? How would the\nright interact with a state or local government\u2019s ability to\ntake special measures during, say, national security emer\ngencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun\nregulation can become highly complex, and these \u201care only\na few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.\u201d Caperton\nv. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (ROB-\nERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n   The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is\nexceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms\ncause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United\nStates each year. Those who live in urban areas, police\nofficers, women, and children, all may be particularly at\nrisk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some\nexperts have calculated, for example, that Chicago\u2019s hand\ngun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to\n1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue\nthat stringent gun regulations \u201ccan help protect police\nofficers operating on the front lines against gun violence,\u201d\nhave reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and\nBaltimore, and have helped to lower New York\u2019s crime and\nhomicide rates.\n   At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt\non these studies. And who is right? Finding out may\nrequire interpreting studies that are only indirectly re\nlated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning\nhandguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci\ndents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home\n14                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthan where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at\nall? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if\nopponents of the ban put forth counter studies?\n   In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer\nto judicial homilies, such as Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century\nperception that a man\u2019s home is his castle. See 4 Black\nstone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere\nassertion, the fact that \u201cincorporation will require judges\nto assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.\u201d\nAnte, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the\ngovernment\u2019s regulatory interests without addressing\nissues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a\nregulation is appropriately tailored without considering its\nimpact? And how can the Court determine if there are\nless restrictive alternatives without considering what will\nhappen if those alternatives are implemented?\n   Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the\nmission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden\ntial approach similar to the many state courts that admin\nister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,\nat 19\u201320 (describing state approaches). But the Court has\nnot yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n57\u201364) (rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d simi\nlar to that employed by the States); ante, at 44 (plurality\nopinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few\nsimple rules, such as that it will not touch \u201cprohibitions on\nthe possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d\n\u201claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive\nplaces such as schools and government buildings,\u201d or \u201claws\nimposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial\nsale of arms.\u201d Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54\u201355);\nAnte, at 39 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and\nnot others? Does the Court know that these regulations\nare justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In\nfact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented\nrules that sound sensible without being able to explain\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhy or how Chicago\u2019s handgun ban is different.\n  The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the\nkinds of empirically based questions that will often deter\nmine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor\ndo they have readily available \u201ctools\u201d for finding and\nevaluating the technical material submitted by others.\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os\nborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also\nTurner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195\u2013196. Judges can\nnot easily make empirically based predictions; they have\nno way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if\nsuch predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation\nand concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult\nfor judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.\nNor can judges rely upon local community views and\nvalues when reaching judgments in circumstances where\nprediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or\nunknown.\n  At the same time, there is no institutional need to send\njudges off on this \u201cmission-almost-impossible.\u201d Legislators\nare able to \u201camass the stuff of actual experience and cull\nconclusions from it.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.\n63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to\nuncover facts and to understand their relevance. And\nlegislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ\nratically responsible for their empirically based and value\nladen conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our\npreference for \u201clegislative not judicial solutions\u201d to this\nkind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,\n457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly\naffirmed the Constitution\u2019s preference for democratic\nsolutions legislated by those whom the people elect.\n  In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 310\u2013\n311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:\n    \u201cSome people assert that our present plight is due, in\n16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n     part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimen\n     tation in the fields of social and economic science; and\n     to the discouragement to which proposals for better\n     ment there have been subjected otherwise. There\n     must be power in the States and the Nation to re\n     mould, through experimentation, our economic prac\n     tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco\n     nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the\n     Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified\n     it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the\n     social problems we face].\u201d\n  There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court\nmay already have refused to take this wise advice with\nrespect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters\nworse here.\n  Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences\nand conditions\u2014both key virtues of federalism\u2014here has\nparticular importance. The incidence of gun ownership\nvaries substantially as between crowded cities and uncon\ngested rural communities, as well as among the different\ngeographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately\n60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated\nWestern States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report\nthat their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of\nadults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode\nIsland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.\n  The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural\ncommunities and cities. Urban centers face significantly\ngreater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural\ncommunities have proportionately greater problems with\nnonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.\nAnd idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find\ning themselves in dramatically different circumstances:\nFor example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times\nhigher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi\nties have historically differed about the need for gun regu\nlation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris\ning that \u201cprimarily, and historically,\u201d the law has treated\nthe exercise of police powers, including gun control, as\n\u201cmatter[s] of local concern.\u201d Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes\ndecisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of\nthis particular right does so without strong offsetting\njustification\u2014as the example of Oak Park\u2019s handgun ban\nhelps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a727\u20132\u2013\n1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,\nafter a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun\nthat his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a\nblanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for\nHandgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak\nPark Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering\ninformation about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000\nsignatures from community residents in support of a ban.\nId., at 21\u201322. And the village board enacted a ban into\nlaw. Id., at 22.\n   Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board\nheld a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The\ncitizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.\nId., at 22\u201323. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak\nPark were handguns and that handguns were misused\nmore often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at\n23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the\ncontrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a\nvote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak\nPark now tells us, crime has decreased and the community\nhas seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.\n   Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the\nquestions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na\ntion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak\n18                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that\npower from the people? What is it here that the people did\nnot know? What is it that a judge knows better?\n                        *     *    *\n  In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative\ndecisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the\ncomparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,\nthe lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life\nthreatening harm that may flow from striking down regu\nlations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor\nporation of other rights has been at issue, some of these\nproblems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob\nlems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to\nbe present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in\nwhich the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.\nAt the same time, the important factors that favor incor\nporation in other instances\u2014e.g., the protection of broader\nconstitutional objectives\u2014are not present here. The up\nshot is that all factors militate against incorporation\u2014\nwith the possible exception of historical factors.\n                             III\n  I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking\nto justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the\nSecond Amendment protects are \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this\nNation\u2019s history and tradition.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 19 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks\nomitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation\u2019s\nhistory for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.\n  As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only\npertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as\nbroadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here\nare evaluating a more particular right\u2014namely, the right\nto bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\u2014general\nhistorical references to the \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nare not always helpful. Depending upon context, early\nhistorical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based\nright\u2014a matter of considerable importance 200 years\nago\u2014which has, as the majority points out, \u201clargely faded\nas a popular concern.\u201d Ante, at 22. There is no reason to\nbelieve that matters of such little contemporary impor\ntance should play a significant role in answering the\nincorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410\n(incorporation \u201cinquiry must focus upon the function\nserved\u201d by the right in question in \u201ccontemporary soci\nety\u201d); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 (1949) (incorpora\ntion must take into account \u201cthe movements of a free\nsociety\u201d and \u201cthe gradual and empiric process of inclusion\nand exclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7910 (prohibiting federal officeholders\nfrom accepting a \u201cTitle, of any kind whatever, from [a]\nforeign State\u201d\u2014presumably a matter of considerable\nimportance 200 years ago).\n   That said, I can find much in the historical record that\nshows that some Americans in some places at certain\ntimes thought it important to keep and bear arms for\nprivate self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that\nmany States have constitutional provisions protecting gun\npossession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions\ntypically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation\nwill be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,\nScrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev.\n683, 686, 716\u2013717 (2007) (the \u201ccourts of every state to\nconsider the question apply a deferential \u2018reasonable\nregulation\u2019 standard\u201d) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);\nsee also id., at 716\u2013717 (explaining the difference between\nthat standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is\nthus altogether unclear whether such provisions would\nprohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as\nthe law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The\nmajority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely\n20                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with Chicago\u2019s law; and the majority would\nalmost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201364) (striking down the District\nof Columbia\u2019s handgun ban).\n   Thus, the specific question before us is not whether\nthere are references to the right to bear arms for self\ndefense throughout this Nation\u2019s history\u2014of course there\nare\u2014or even whether the Court should incorporate a\nsimple constitutional requirement that firearms regula\ntions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear\narms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so\nsubstantial a private self-defense right as the one de\nscribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks\nberg, supra, at 721 (requiring \u201ca careful description\u201d of the\nright at issue when deciding whether it is \u201cdeeply rooted\nin this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to\nmake up his or her own mind about the historical record\nthat I describe in part below. In my view, that record is\ninsufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private\nself-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the\nsense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi\ndence below shows, States and localities have consistently\nenacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi\nlar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation\u2019s history.\nCourts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,\nat the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor\nporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a\ndifferent right to bear arms than they currently recog\nnize\u2014a right that threatens to destabilize settled state\nlegal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201364)\n(rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d similar to\nthat employed by the States).\n   I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to\nwhether the right described by Heller is \u201cfundamental\u201d as\nour incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient historical support for the majority\u2019s conclusion\nthat that right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history\nand tradition.\u201d Instead, I find no more than ambiguity\nand uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians\nwould find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record\nthat is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate\nbasis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and\napplying it against the States.\nThe Eighteenth Century\n   The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th\ncentury evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u201332);\nid., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5\u201331); id.,\nat ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20137). In respect\nto the relevant question\u2014the \u201cdeeply rooted nature\u201d of a\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense\u2014that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when\naugmented as follows:\n   First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUS-\nTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in\nHeller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted\nprimarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related\nrights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5\u2013\n31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written\non the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2\u20135.\n   Second, historians now tell us that the right to which\nBlackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma\njority\u2019s historical argument, concerned the right of Par\nliament (representing the people) to form a militia to\noppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the\npeople of their traditional liberties (which did not include\nan unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century\nlanguage referring to a \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d does\nnot ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense\u2014\ncertainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians\u2019\nBrief 3\u201327; see also supra, at 2\u20135.\n22                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were\nheavily regulated at the time of the framing\u2014perhaps\nmore heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.\nFor example, one scholar writes that \u201c[h]undreds of indi\nvidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns\nin colonial and early national America.\u201d Churchill, Gun\nRegulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,\n25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat\nutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,\nas well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct\nin Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of\nMassachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, & H. Flanders,\nStatutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.\n108\u2013109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.\n748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162\u2013163 (discuss\ning bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New\nYork).\n  Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several\nStates continued to regulate firearms possession by, for\nexample, adopting rules that would have prevented the\ncarrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5\u20137) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 59\u201360). Scholars have thus concluded\nthat the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State\u2019s\npolice power to regulate guns appears to be only that\nregulations were \u201caimed at a legitimate public purpose\u201d\nand \u201cconsistent with reason.\u201d Cornell, Early American\nGun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &\nHist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).\nThe Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century\n   I would also augment the majority\u2019s account of this\nperiod as follows:\n   First, additional States began to regulate the discharge\nof firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,\n\u00a76, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Acts 306.\n   Second, States began to regulate the possession of con\ncealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.\nSee, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early\nRepublic 143\u2013152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also\n1837\u20131838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200\u2013201 (banning\nthe wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.\nActs ch. 7, \u00a78, p. 110, (\u201cAny free person who shall habitu\nally carry about his person, hidden from common observa\ntion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like\nkind, from the use of which the death of any person might\nprobably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]\nfine not exceed fifty dollars\u201d).\n   State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,\nfinding that, even when the state constitution granted a\nright to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,\n\u201cabolish\u201d these small, inexpensive, \u201cmost dangerous weap\nons entirely from use,\u201d even in self-defense. Day v. State,\n37 Tenn. 496, 500 (1857); see also, e.g., State v. Jumel, 13\nLa. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban\nbecause it \u201cprohibited only a particular mode of bearing\narms which is found dangerous to the peace of society\u201d);\nState v.

See\nante, at 10. The Court\u2019s case for incorporation must thus\nrest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is \u201cfun\n24                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndamental.\u201d But the very evidence that it advances in\nsupport of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri\ncans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows\nwith equal force that Americans wanted African-American\ncitizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did\nwhite citizens. Ante, at 22\u201333. Here, for example is what\nCongress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment\npredecessor, the Second Freedman\u2019s Bureau Act. It wrote\nthat the statute, in order to secure \u201cthe constitutional\nright to bear arms . . . for all citizens,\u201d would assure that\neach citizen:\n     \u201cshall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and\n     proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se\n     curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition\n     of estate, real and personal, including the constitu\n     tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all\n     the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re\n     spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\u201d\n     \u00a714, 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (emphasis added).\nThis sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See\nRosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth\nAmendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of\nIncorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383\u2013384\n(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\nwas focused on discrimination).\n    Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See\n\u00a71, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of \u201cevery race and color, without\nregard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\nservitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in\nvarious activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens\u201d). And, of course, the\nFourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar\nantee their citizens the \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d\n    There is thus every reason to believe that the funda\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the\neradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new\nsubstantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state\npolice power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 62\u201369 (discussing congressional record evi\ndence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about\ndiscrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the\nFourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right\nto Southerners who had so recently waged war against the\nNorth, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently\nfreed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,\n\u00a76, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because\nthey were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).\n   Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th\ncentury was common. The majority is correct that the\nFreedmen\u2019s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it\nstands to reason, as the majority points out, that \u201c[i]t\nwould have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee\nthe . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.\u201d\nAnte, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that\nthere existed during this period a fundamental right to\nbear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason\nable exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The\nLimits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun\nRegulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &\nPol\u2019y Rev. 615, 621\u2013622 (2006) (noting that history shows\nthat \u201cnineteenth-century Americans\u201d were \u201cnot opposed to\nthe idea that the state should be able to control the use of\nfirearms\u201d).\n   To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a\nnumber of state constitutions adopted or amended after\nthe Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature\u2019s gen\neral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a713 (1869) (protecting \u201cthe right to keep and\nbear arms,\u201d \u201cunder such regulations as the legislature\nmay prescribe\u201d); Idaho Const., Art. I, \u00a711 (1889) (\u201cThe\n26                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npeople have the right to bear arms . . .; but the Legislature\nshall regulate the exercise of this right by law\u201d); Utah\nConst., Art. I, \u00a76 (1896) (same). And numerous other state\nconstitutional provisions adopted during this period ex\nplicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory\npower over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes\nsional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14\u201315 (hereinafter\nLegal Historians\u2019 Brief).\n   Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of\nall nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879\nTenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, \u00a71 (prohibiting citizens from\ncarrying \u201cpublicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket\npistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or\nnavy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car\nried openly in the hand\u201d); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,\n\u00a71 (forbidding \u201cconcealed or ope[n]\u201d bearing of \u201cany fire\narm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,\ntown or village\u201d); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, \u00a71 (pro\nhibiting the \u201cwear[ing] or carry[ng]\u201d of \u201cany pistol . . .\nexcept such pistols as are used in the army or navy,\u201d\nexcept while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12,\n1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless\nthere are \u201cimmediate and pressing\u201d reasonable grounds to\nfear \u201cimmediate and pressing\u201d attack or for militia ser\nvice). Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols\nand other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians\u2019 Brief 16,\nn. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent\ngun controls, often in response to local conditions\u2014Dodge\nCity, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle\ntowns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger\nous weapons in response to violence accompanying west\nern cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30\n(citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, \u00a7XI (Sept. 22,\n1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns\nin America: A Reader 96 (J. Dizard et al. eds. 1999) (dis\ncussing how Western cattle towns required cowboys to\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

State, 35 Tex. 473 (1871); Hill v. State,\n53 Ga. 472, 475 (1874); Fife v. State, 31 Ark. 455, 461\n(1876); State v. Workman, 35 W. Va. 367, 373 (1891). The\nTennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on posses\nsion of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons,\nsummarized the Reconstruction understanding of the\nstates\u2019 police power to regulate firearms:\n    \u201cAdmitting the right of self-defense in its broadest\n    sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is\n    bound to yield his preference as to the means to be\n    used, to the demands of the public good; and where\n    certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the\n    law of the land, in order to the prevention of [sic]\n    crime\u2014a great public end\u2014no man can be permitted\n    to disregard this general end, and demand of the\n    community the right, in order to gratify his whim or\n    willful desire to use a particular weapon in his par\n    ticular self-defense. The law allows ample means of\n    self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we\n    have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.\n    The object being to banish these weapons from the\n    community by an absolute prohibition for the preven\n    tion of crime, no man\u2019s particular safety, if such case\n    could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.\u201d\n    Andrews v. State, 50 Tenn. 165, 188\u2013189 (1871) (em\n    phasis added).\nThe Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n  Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st\ncentury evidence concerning the Second Amendment at\nany length, I think that it is essential to consider the\nrecent history of the right to bear arms for private self\ndefense when considering whether the right is \u201cfundamen\n28                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntal.\u201d To that end, many States now provide state constitu\ntional protection for an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear\narms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep\nand Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191, 205 (2006)\n(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor\ntance of this fact, we should keep the following considera\ntions in mind:\n   First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and\nmany local communities, highly detailed and complicated\nregulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)\nnearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell\nguns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns\nand what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms\nmust be stored and where they may be used; and so on.\nSee generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu\nlating Guns In America (2008), available at http://\nwww.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all\nInternet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (detailing various arms regu\nlations in every State).\n   Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban\nhandguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the\nright to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a78\u2013\n20\u2013050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u2013\n1, 27\u20131\u20131 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25\n(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico\nban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a712280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.\nStat. Ann. \u00a753\u2013202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7134\u20138\n(1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a74\u2013303(a) (Lexis 2002);\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 140, \u00a7131M (West 2006); N. J.

Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a74\u2013303\n(Lexis 2002).\n   Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with\nconstitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni\nformly interpreted those rights as providing protection\nonly against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,\nWinkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the \u201ccourts of every state to\nconsider\u201d a gun regulation apply the \u201c \u2018reasonable regula\ntion\u2019 \u201d approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238\n(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City & County of Denver, 874\nP. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).\n   When determining reasonableness those courts have\nnormally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards\nlegislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723\n(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti\ncle\u2019s publication striking down gun control laws: three that\nbanned \u201cthe transportation of any firearms for any pur\npose whatsoever,\u201d a single \u201cpermitting law,\u201d and two as\napplied challenges in \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d). Hence, as\nevidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States\nand local governments maintain substantial flexibility to\nregulate firearms\u2014much as they seemingly have through\nout the Nation\u2019s history\u2014even in those States with an\narms right in their constitutions.\n30                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Although one scholar implies that state courts are less\nwilling to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im\nplementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-\nDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research\nAgenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware\nof no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court\nhas struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a\nparticular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.\n   Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu\ntional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula\ntions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.\nVillage of Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 499, 470 N. E. 2d\n266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the\narms right is merely a right \u201cto possess some form of\nweapon suitable for self-defense or recreation\u201d); Cleveland\nv. Turner, No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct. App.,\nAug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban \u201cdoes not absolutely interfere\nwith the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro\nscribes possession of a specifically defined category of\nhandguns\u201d); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d\n38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons\nunder 21 did not infringe arms right because they can\n\u201cposses[s] other types of guns\u201d). Thus, the majority\u2019s\ndecision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec\nognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re\ngimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.\n   Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few\nstate courts, a \u201cpaucity\u201d of state courts, have specifically\nupheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts\nhave struck them down? The absence of supporting in\nformation does not help the majority find support. Cf.\nUnited States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting\nthat it is \u201ctreacherous to find in congressional silence\nalone the adoption of a controlling rule of law\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).

There has been, and is, no consensus that the\nright is, or was, \u201cfundamental.\u201d No broader constitutional\ninterest or principle supports legal treatment of that right\nas fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional\nconcerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against\nthat treatment.\n   Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century\nhistory shows a consensus that the right to private armed\nself-defense, as described in Heller, is \u201cdeeply rooted in\nthis Nation\u2019s history or tradition\u201d or is otherwise \u201cfunda\nmental.\u201d Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in\nHeller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read\nin the majority\u2019s favor, the historical evidence is at most\nambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for\nits conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of\nself-defense against the States.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n32                  MCDONALD v.

CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, \n\n                      ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131521. Argued March 2, 2010\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this\n Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep\n and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a Dis\n trict of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the\n home. Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chi\n cago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by\n almost all private citizens. After Heller, petitioners filed this federal\n suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related ac\n tions, alleging that the City\u2019s handgun ban has left them vulnerable\n to criminals. They sought a declaration that the ban and several re\n lated City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amend\n ments. Rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument that the ordinances are un\n constitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously\n had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had\n explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment\n applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow estab\n lished Circuit precedent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on\n three 19th-century cases\u2014United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542,\n Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U.

CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    teenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, rec\n    ognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self\n    defense. Pp. 5\u20139, 11\u201319, 19\u201333.\n       (a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions. Primarily, they\n    argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privi\n    leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\n    the Slaughter-House Cases\u2019 narrow interpretation of the Clause\n    should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, they contend that\n    the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the\n    Second Amendment right. Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respon\n    dents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to\n    the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any \u201c \u2018civi\n    lized\u2019 \u201d legal system. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country\n    that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that\n    right is not protected by due process. And since there are civilized\n    countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of hand\n    guns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such meas\n    ures. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally\n    applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g.,\n    Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85827\"><a href=\"/opinion/85827/barron-ex-rel-tiernan-v-mayor-of-baltimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247, but the\n    constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War\u2019s aftermath\n    fundamentally altered the federal system. Four years after the adop\n    tion of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-\n    House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\n    those rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government,\n    its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,\u201d 16 Wall., at 79,\n    and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Fed\n    eral Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76. Under\n    this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause protects only very limited rights. Id., at 79\u201380. Subse\n    quently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to\n    the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116\n    U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Sev\n    enth Circuit relied in this case. Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms\n    applies to the States is considered in light of the Court\u2019s precedents\n    applying the Bill of Rights\u2019 protections to the States. Pp. 11\u201319.\n          (1) In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due\n    Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights pro\n    tections. See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516. Five fea\n    tures of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted. First,\n    the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from\n    the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncitizenship. See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99. Second, the\nCourt explained that the only rights due process protected against\nstate infringement were those \u201cof such a nature that they are in\ncluded in the conception of due process of law.\u201d Ibid. Third, some\ncases during this era \u201ccan be seen as having asked . . . if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the particular pro\ntection\u201d asserted therein. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149,\nn. 14. Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights\nguarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection,\nfinding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v.\nNew York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283\nU. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hur\ntado, supra. Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within\nthe conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded\nagainst state infringement sometimes differed from those provided\nagainst abridgment by the Federal Government. Pp. 11\u201313.\n     (2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of\nRights\u2019 provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 71\u2013\n72 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that the\nory. Pp. 13\u201315.\n     (3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by\nJustice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by\nwhich the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights con\ntained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U. S. 335, 341. These decisions abandoned three of the charac\nteristics of the earlier period. The Court clarified that the governing\nstandard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is funda\nmental to our Nation\u2019s particular scheme of ordered liberty and sys\ntem of justice. Duncan, supra, at 149, n. 14. The Court eventually\nheld that almost all of the Bill of Rights\u2019 guarantees met the re\nquirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\nalso held that Bill of Rights protections must \u201call . . . be enforced\nagainst the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to\nthe same standards that protect those personal rights against federal\nencroachment.\u201d Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10. Under this ap\nproach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular\nBill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.\nSee, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S.\n455. Pp. 15\u201319.\n   (d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States. Pp. 19\u201333.\n     (1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to\nthe Nation\u2019s scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391\n4                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether\n    it is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washing\n    ton v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. Heller points unmistakably to\n    the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal\n    systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held\n    that individual self-defense is \u201cthe central component\u201d of the Second\n    Amendment right. 554 U. S., at ___, ___. Explaining that \u201cthe need\n    for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\u201d in the home,\n    ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because\n    they are \u201cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to \u2018keep\u2019 and use\n    for protection of one\u2019s home and family,\u201d id., at ___, ___\u2013___. It thus\n    concluded that citizens must be permitted \u201cto use [handguns] for the\n    core lawful purpose of self-defense.\u201d Id., at ___. Heller also clarifies\n    that this right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradi\n    tions,\u201d Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Heller explored the right\u2019s origins\n    in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was re\n    garded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of\n    the Bill of Rights. This is powerful evidence that the right was re\n    garded as fundamental in the sense relevant here. That understand\n    ing persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights\u2019\n    ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era,\n    which protected the right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 19\u201322.\n         (2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates\n    clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Framers and ratifiers\n    counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental\n    rights necessary to the Nation\u2019s system of ordered liberty. Pp. 22\u201333.\n            (i) By the 1850\u2019s, the fear that the National Government would\n    disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep\n    and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense. Abolitionist au\n    thors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm \u201cFree-\n    Soilers\u201d in \u201cBloody Kansas,\u201d met with outrage that the constitutional\n    right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people. After\n    the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to\n    disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.\n    These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen\u2019s\n    Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the\n    right to keep and bear arms. Congress, however, ultimately deemed\n    these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth\n    Amendment. Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment\n    was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the\n    rights set out in the Civil Rights Act. See General Building Contrac\n    tors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389. In Congressional\n    debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the\n    39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndamental right deserving of protection. Evidence from the period\nimmediately following the Amendment\u2019s ratification confirms that\nthat right was considered fundamental. Pp. 22\u201331.\n        (ii) Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that\nMembers of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \u00a71 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule. But while \u00a71 does\ncontain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause,\nit can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit dis\ncrimination. If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second\nAmendment should be singled out for special\u2014and specially unfavor\nable\u2014treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion. The right to keep\nand bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a\nprohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in\nan evenhanded manner. Pp. 30\u201333.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded, in Parts II\u2013C, IV, and V, that the Four\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second\nAmendment right recognized in Heller. Pp. 10\u201311, 33\u201344.\n   (a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one\nof the \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d\nThere is no need to reconsider the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases because,\nfor many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether par\nticular rights are protected against state infringement under the\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Pp. 10\u201311.\n   (b) Municipal respondents\u2019 remaining arguments are rejected be\ncause they are at war with Heller\u2019s central holding. In effect, they\nask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a\ndifferent body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights\nguarantees. Pp. 33\u201340.\n   (c) The dissents\u2019 objections are addressed and rejected. Pp. 41\u201344.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recog\nnized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable\nto the States. However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion\nthat is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second\nAmendment\u2019s text and history. The Court is correct in describing the\nSecond Amendment right as \u201cfundamental\u201d to the American scheme\nof ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and\n\u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and traditions,\u201d Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. But the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nDue Process Clause, which speaks only to \u201cprocess,\u201d cannot impose\nthe type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court\nasserts. Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable\n6                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship\n    recognized by \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter\n    alia: \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\n    privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In inter\n    preting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional\n    provisions are \u201c \u2018written to be understood by the voters.\u2019 \u201d Heller, 554\n    U. S., at ___. The objective of this inquiry is to discern what \u201cordi\n    nary citizens\u201d at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s ratification\n    would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause to mean. Ibid. A survey of contemporary legal authorities\n    plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the\n    Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the\n    right to keep and bear arms.

CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\napplicable to the States.\n                                  I\n   Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and\nDavid Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents\nwho would like to keep handguns in their homes for self\ndefense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago\u2019s\nfirearms laws. A City ordinance provides that \u201c[n]o person\nshall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the\nholder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.\u201d\nChicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a78\u201320\u2013040(a) (2009). The\nCode then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus\neffectively banning handgun possession by almost all\nprivate citizens who reside in the City. \u00a78\u201320\u2013050(c).\nLike Chicago, Oak Park makes it \u201cunlawful for any person\nto possess . . . any firearm,\u201d a term that includes \u201cpistols,\nrevolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as\nhandguns.\u201d Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u20131\n(2007), 27\u20131\u20131 (2009).\n   Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents\n\u201cfrom the loss of property and injury or death from fire\narms.\u201d See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the\nCity Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti\ntioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun\nban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police\nDepartment statistics, we are told, reveal that the City\u2019s\nhandgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban\nwas enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of\nthe highest murder rates in the country and rates of other\nviolent crimes that exceed the average in comparable\ncities.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6\u20137 (noting that\n\nhandgun murder rate was 9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008).\n  2 Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n8\u20139 (\u201cIn 2002 and again in 2008, Chicago had more murders than any\nother city in the U.

For instance, Otis McDonald, who\nis in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood.\nHe is a community activist involved with alternative\npolicing strategies, and his efforts to improve his\nneighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from\ndrug dealers.

Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resi\ndent whose home has been targeted by burglars. \u201cIn Mrs.\nLawson\u2019s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago\nwould decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or\ndeath should she ever be threatened again in her home.\u201d3\nMcDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own\nhandguns that they store outside of the city limits, but\nthey would like to keep their handguns in their homes for\nprotection. See App. 16\u201319, 43\u201344 (McDonald), 20\u201324 (C.\nLawson), 19, 36 (Orlov), 20\u201321, 40 (D. Lawson).\n   After our decision in Heller, the Chicago petitioners and\ntwo groups4 filed suit against the City in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They\nsought a declaration that the handgun ban and several\nrelated Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Four\nteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nAnother action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in\nthe same District Court by the National Rifle Association\n(NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA\nand others filed a third action challenging the Chicago\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nYork\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Brief for Interna\ntional Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 17\u201321, and App. A (providing comparisons of Chicago\u2019s\nrates of assault, murder, and robbery to average crime rates in 24 other\nlarge cities).\n   3 Brief for Women State Legislators et al. as Amici Curiae 2.\n   4 The Illinois State Rifle Association and the Second Amendment\n\nFoundation, Inc.\n4                  MCDONALD v.

The court noted that the Seventh\nCircuit had \u201csquarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban\non handguns a quarter century ago,\u201d id., at 753 (citing\nQuilici v.

The Seventh\nCircuit described the rationale of those cases as \u201cdefunct\u201d\nand recognized that they did not consider the question\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\nincorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms. NRA, Inc. v. Chicago, 567 F. 3d 856, 857, 858\n(2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it\nwas obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that\nhave \u201cdirect application,\u201d and it declined to predict how\nthe Second Amendment would fare under this Court\u2019s\nmodern \u201cselective incorporation\u201d approach.

As a secon\ndary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cincorporates\u201d the\nSecond Amendment right.\n  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main\ntain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the\nStates only if that right is an indispensable attribute of\nany \u201c \u2018civilized\u2019 \u201d legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon\ndents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that\ndoes not recognize the right, the municipal respondents\ntell us, then that right is not protected by due process.\nIbid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or\nstrictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the\nmunicipal respondents maintain that due process does not\npreclude such measures. Id., at 21\u201323. In light of the\nparties\u2019 far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting\nthis Court\u2019s analysis over the years of the relationship\nbetween the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.\n                             B\n   The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,\noriginally applied only to the Federal Government.

In less than four\npages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the\nfirst eight Amendments operate as limitations on the\n6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, holding that they apply only to the Federal Gov\nernment. See also Lessee of Livingston v.

The provision at issue in this case, \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other\nthings, that a State may not abridge \u201cthe privileges or\nimmunities of citizens of the United States\u201d or deprive\n\u201cany person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc\ness of law.\u201d\n   Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, this Court was asked to interpret the\nAmendment\u2019s reference to \u201cthe privileges or immunities of\ncitizens of the United States.\u201d The Slaughter-House\nCases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per\nmitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the\nbutchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.\nJustice Samuel Miller\u2019s opinion for the Court concluded\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\nthose rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal\ngovernment, its National character, its Constitution, or its\nlaws.\u201d Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental\nrights\u2014rights that predated the creation of the Federal\nGovernment and that \u201cthe State governments were cre\nated to establish and secure\u201d\u2014were not protected by the\nClause. Id., at 76.\n   In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of\nfederal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two\nprincipal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\nClause spoke of \u201cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States,\u201d and the Court contrasted this phrasing\nwith the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5\n(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con\ntrary reading would \u201cradically chang[e] the whole theory\nof the relations of the State and Federal governments to\neach other and of both these governments to the people,\u201d\nand the Court refused to conclude that such a change had\nbeen made \u201cin the absence of language which expresses\nsuch a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.\u201d Id., at 78.\nFinding the phrase \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States\u201d lacking by this high standard, the\nCourt reasoned that the phrase must mean something\nmore limited.\n  Under the Court\u2019s narrow reading, the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause protects such things as the right\n     \u201cto come to the seat of government to assert any claim\n     [a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans\n     act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro\n     tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering\n     its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State\n     of the Union by a bon\u00e2 fide residence therein, with the\n     same rights as other citizens of that State.\u201d Id., at\n     79\u201380 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Finding no constitutional protection against state intru\nsion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the\nCourt upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus\ntice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices\nSwayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes \u201c[a]ll per\n\nsons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris\ndiction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein\nthey reside.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause\nof Article IV provides that \u201c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)\n8                  MCDONALD v.

Id., at 96\u201397. Justice Bradley\u2019s dis\nsent observed that \u201cwe are not bound to resort to implica\ntion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the\nmost important privileges and immunities of citizens of\nthe United States. It is in the Constitution itself.\u201d Id., at\n118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated\nin the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.\nId., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority\u2019s nar\nrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as\n\u201cturn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.\u201d Id.,\nat 129 (dissenting opinion).\n   Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of\nthe narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,\nSaenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment\nagree \u201cthat the Clause does not mean what the Court said\nit meant in 1873\u201d); Amar, Substance and Method in the\nYear 2000, 28 Pepperdine L.

In that case, the Court reviewed convictions\nstemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi\nana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many\nunarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white\nmen.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed\nAfrican-American prisoners through the streets and then\nhad them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were\nindicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine\nwent to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;\nthe remaining three were acquitted of murder but con\nvicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for\nbanding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of\nvarious constitutional rights, including the right to bear\narms.8\n    The Court reversed all of the convictions, including\nthose relating to the deprivation of the victims\u2019 right to\nbear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court\nwrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose\n\u201cis not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d and is not \u201cin\nany manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis\ntence.\u201d Id., at 553. \u201cThe second amendment,\u201d the Court\ncontinued, \u201cdeclares that it shall not be infringed; but this\n. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by\nCongress.\u201d Ibid. \u201cOur later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,\n116 U. S. 252, 265 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S.\n535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment\napplies only to the Federal Government.\u201d Heller, 554\nU.

Petitioners argue,\nhowever, that we should overrule those decisions and hold\nthat the right to keep and bear arms is one of the \u201cprivi\nleges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In\npetitioners\u2019 view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprotects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as\nwell as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15\u201321,\nbut petitioners are unable to identify the Clause\u2019s full\nscope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 8\u201311. Nor is there any consen\nsus on that question among the scholars who agree that\nthe Slaughter-House Cases\u2019 interpretation is flawed. See\nSaenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.\nFor many decades, the question of the rights protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement\nhas been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that\nAmendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities\nClause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-\nHouse holding.\n   At the same time, however, this Court\u2019s decisions in\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from\nconsidering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right\nbinding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23\n(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases \u201cengage[d] in\nthe sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by\nour later cases.\u201d Ibid. As explained more fully below,\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in\nwhich the Court began the process of \u201cselective incorpo\nration\u201d under the Due Process Clause, and we have never\npreviously addressed the question whether the right to\nkeep and bear arms applies to the States under that\ntheory.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding\nthat other rights that were at issue in that case are bind\ning on the States through the Due Process Clause. In\nCruikshank, the Court held that the general \u201cright of the\npeople peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,\u201d which\nis protected by the First Amendment, applied only against\nthe Federal Government and not against the States. See\n92 U. S., at 551\u2013552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the\nCourt held that the right of peaceful assembly was a \u201cfun\ndamental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d De Jonge v. Oregon, 299\nU. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and\nthus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms\napplies to the States under the Due Process Clause.\n                              D\n                               1\n  In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider\nwhether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from\ninfringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado\nv. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not\nrequire grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.\nChicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits\nStates from taking of private property for public use with\nout just compensation). Five features of the approach\ntaken during the ensuing era should be noted.\n  First, the Court viewed the due process question as\nentirely separate from the question whether a right was a\nprivilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin\ning v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).\n  Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro\ntected against state infringement by the Due Process\nClause were those rights \u201cof such a nature that they are\nincluded in the conception of due process of law.\u201d Ibid.\nSee also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);\nBetts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297\nU. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).\nWhile it was \u201cpossible that some of the personal rights\nsafeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na\ntional action [might] also be safeguarded against state\naction,\u201d the Court stated, this was \u201cnot because those\nrights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.\u201d\nTwining, supra, at 99.\n   The Court used different formulations in describing the\nboundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the\nCourt referred to \u201cimmutable principles of justice which\ninhere in the very idea of free government which no mem\nber of the Union may disregard.\u201d 211 U. S., at 102 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu\nsetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights\nthat are \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d And in Palko, the\nCourt famously said that due process protects those rights\nthat are \u201cthe very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\u201d\nand essential to \u201ca fair and enlightened system of justice.\u201d\n302 U. S., at 325.\n   Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court\n\u201ccan be seen as having asked, when inquiring into\nwhether some particular procedural safeguard was re\nquired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined\nthat would not accord the particular protection.\u201d Duncan\nv. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in\nholding that due process prohibits a State from taking\nprivate property without just compensation, the Court\ndescribed the right as \u201ca principle of natural equity, rec\nognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from\na deep and universal sense of its justice.\u201d Chicago, B. &\nQ. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that\ndue process did not provide a right against compelled\nincrimination in part because this right \u201chas no place in\nthe jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe domain of the common law.\u201d Twining, supra, at 113.\n    Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to\nhold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to\nmeet the test for inclusion within the protection of the\nDue Process Clause. The Court found that some such\nrights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.\n652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.\nMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);\nPowell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De\nJonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con\nnecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).\nBut others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury\nindictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege\nagainst self-incrimination).\n    Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights\nwas held to fall within the conception of due process, the\nprotection or remedies afforded against state infringement\nsometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro\nvided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To\ngive one example, in Betts the Court held that, although\nthe Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun\nsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant\nwas unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause\nrequired appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed\nings only where \u201cwant of counsel in [the] particular case\n. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental\nfairness.\u201d 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo\nrado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the \u201ccore of\nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d was implicit in the concept of\nordered liberty and thus \u201cenforceable against the States\nthrough the Due Process Clause\u201d but that the exclusionary\nrule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the\nStates. Id., at 27\u201328, 33.\n                          2\n  An alternative theory regarding the relationship be\n14                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntween the Bill of Rights and \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held\nthat \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,\nAdamson, supra, at 71\u201372 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,\nsupra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black\nnoted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four\nteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend\nment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,\nin so doing, overruled this Court\u2019s decision in Barron.9\nAdamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee\n\non Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated\nthat the Amendment protected all of \u201cthe personal rights guarantied\nand secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.\u201d Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.\nGlobe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text\nof \u00a71, said that the Amendment would \u201carm the Congress . . . with the\npower to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution\ntoday.\u201d Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089\u20131090; A. Amar, The Bill of\nRights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill\nof Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained\nthe view that the rights guaranteed by \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment \u201care chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti\ntution of the United States.\u201d Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84\n(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader\nof the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that \u201cthe\nConstitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation\non the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con\ngress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe\n2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth\nAmendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30\nstatements during the debates in Congress interpreting \u00a71 to incorpo\nrate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that \u201c[n]ot a single\nsenator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand\ning\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n  10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the\n\nsignificance of these statements. They contend that the phrase \u201cprivi\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU. S. 335, 341 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 5\u20136\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nleges or immunities\u201d is not naturally read to mean the rights set out in\nthe first eight Amendments, see Brief for Historians et al. as Amici\nCuriae 13\u201316, and that \u201cthere is \u2018support in the legislative history for\nno fewer than four interpretations of the . . . Privileges or Immunities\nClause.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Currie, The\nReconstruction Congress, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 383, 406 (2008); brackets\nomitted). They question whether there is sound evidence of \u201c \u2018any\nstrong public awareness of nationalizing the entire Bill of Rights.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Wildenthal, Nationalizing\nthe Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the Four\nteenth Amendment in 1866\u201367, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509, 1600 (2007)).\nScholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, e.g.,\nFairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of\nRights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of\nRights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St.\nL. J. 435 (1981).\n  Proponents of the view that \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States re\nspond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used\ninterchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64\u201365, and that\nthe position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the\nAmendment was widely publicized and understood, see, e.g., Wilden\nthal, supra, at 1564\u20131565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understand\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866\u20131868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695 (2009). A number of scholars have\nfound support for the total incorporation of the Bill of Rights. See\nCurtis, supra, at 57\u2013130; Aynes, On Misreading John Bingham and the\nFourteenth Amendment, 103 Yale L. J. 57, 61 (1993); see also Amar,\nBill of Rights 181\u2013230. We take no position with respect to this aca\ndemic debate.\n16                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403\u2013404 (1965);\nWashington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967); Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 147\u2013148; Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 794\n(1969).\n  The decisions during this time abandoned three of the\npreviously noted characteristics of the earlier period.11\nThe Court made it clear that the governing standard is not\nwhether any \u201ccivilized system [can] be imagined that\nwould not accord the particular protection.\u201d Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149, n. 14. Instead, the Court inquired whether a\nparticular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our\nscheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at\n149, and n. 14; see also id., at 148 (referring to those\n\u201cfundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at\nthe base of all our civil and political institutions\u201d (empha\nsis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights\nguaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for\nprotection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\neventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the\nBill of Rights.12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights pro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition\n\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause\npresent different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumer\nated rights, we have required that a right also be \u201cimplicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.\u201d See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  12 With respect to the First Amendment, see Everson v. Board of Ed.\n\nof Ewing, 330 U.

S., at 10\u201311 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nInstead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nU.

S. 660 (1962) (cruel and unusual punishment); Schilb v. Kuebel,\n404 U. S. 357 (1971) (prohibition against excessive bail).\n   13 In addition to the right to keep and bear arms (and the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to a unanimous jury verdict, see n. 14, infra), the\nonly rights not fully incorporated are (1) the Third Amendment\u2019s\nprotection against quartering of soldiers; (2) the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\ngrand jury indictment requirement; (3) the Seventh Amendment right\nto a jury trial in civil cases; and (4) the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibi\ntion on excessive fines.\n   We never have decided whether the Third Amendment or the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States\nthrough the Due Process Clause. See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,\nInc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 276, n. 22 (1989) (declining to\ndecide whether the excessive-fines protection applies to the States); see\nalso Engblom v.

S. 38, 48\u201349 (1985).14\n  Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier\ndecisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani\nmous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a\nunanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,\n406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356\n(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the\nresult of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement\nof the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices\nagreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the\nFederal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395\n(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus\ntices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,\n406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the\nview that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in\nfederal and state criminal trials, id., at 414\u2013415 (Stewart, J., dissent\ning); Johnson, supra, at 381\u2013382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice\nPowell\u2019s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not\nstate, cases.     Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well\nestablished rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply\nidentically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,\nsupra, at 395\u2013396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (\u201cIn any\nevent, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court\nremains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of\nRights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial\nguarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application\nagainst both State and Federal Governments\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In answering that question, as just explained, we\nmust decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is\nfundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,\n391 U.

As we noted in Heller, King George III\u2019s attempt\nto disarm the colonists in the 1760\u2019s and 1770\u2019s \u201cprovoked\npolemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as\nEnglishmen to keep arms.\u201d16 Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21);\nsee also L.

Fed\neralists responded, not by arguing that the right was\ninsufficiently important to warrant protection but by\ncontending that the right was adequately protected by the\nConstitution\u2019s assignment of only limited powers to the\nFederal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25\u2013\n26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike\nagreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the\nnewly formed system of government. See Levy 143\u2013149;\nJ. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an\nAnglo-American Right 155\u2013164 (1994). But those who\nwere fearful that the new Federal Government would\ninfringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and\nbear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as\na condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327\u2013331 (2d ed.\n1854); 3 id., at 657\u2013661; 4 id., at 242\u2013246, 248\u2013249; see\nalso Levy 26\u201334; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American\nConstitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th\ned. 1991).

CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its\nefforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms\ndemonstrate that the right was still recognized to be\nfundamental.\n   The most explicit evidence of Congress\u2019 aim appears in\n\u00a714 of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided\nthat \u201cthe right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws\nand proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal\nsecurity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of\nestate, real and personal, including the constitutional\nright to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all\nthe citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previ\nous condition of slavery.\u201d 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (emphasis\nadded).22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that \u201call\nthe citizens,\u201d black and white, would have \u201cthe constitu\ntional right to bear arms.\u201d\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was\nconsidered at the same time as the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\nAct, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to\nkeep and bear arms.23 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncally interfered with.\u201d Joint Committee on Reconstruction, H. R. Rep.\nNo. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 140 (1866).\n   22 The Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bill was amended to include an express\n\nreference to the right to keep and bear arms, see 39th Cong. Globe 654\n(Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that\nthe unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at\n743 (Sen. Lyman Trumbull).\n   23 There can be do doubt that the principal proponents of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1866 meant to end the disarmament of African Americans\nin the South. In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its\npurpose as securing to blacks the \u201cprivileges which are essential to\nfreemen.\u201d Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described\nMississippi law that \u201cprohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having\nfire-arms\u201d and explained that the bill would \u201cdestroy\u201d such laws. Ibid.\nSimilarly, Representative Sidney Clarke cited disarmament of freed\nmen in Alabama and Mississippi as a reason to support the Civil Rights\nAct and to continue to deny Alabama and Mississippi representation in\nCongress: \u201cI regret, sir, that justice compels me to say, to the disgrace\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This language was vir\ntually identical to language in \u00a714 of the Freedmen\u2019s\nBureau Act, 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (\u201cthe right . . . to have full\nand equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning\npersonal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition,\nenjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d).\nAnd as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that\none of the \u201claws and proceedings concerning personal\nliberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment,\nand disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d was \u201cthe\nconstitutional right to bear arms.\u201d Ibid. Representative\nBingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the\nsame rights as enumerated in the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bill,\nwhich of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and\nbear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable\nconclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen\u2019s\nBureau Act, aimed to protect \u201cthe constitutional right to\nbear arms\u201d and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 264\u2013265 (noting that one of the\n\u201ccore purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the\nFourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances\u201d of\nfreedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to\n\u201caffirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self\ndefense\u201d).\n   Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof the Federal Government, that the \u2018reconstructed\u2019 State authorities of\nMississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers and\narm the rebels fresh from the field of treasonable strife. Sir, the dis\narmed loyalists of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana are powerless\nto-day, and oppressed by the pardoned and encouraged rebels of those\nStates. They appeal to the American Congress for protection. In\nresponse to this appeal I shall vote for every just measure of protection,\nfor I do not intend to be among the treacherous violators of the solemn\npledge of the nation.\u201d Id., at 1838\u20131839.\n28                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nremedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential\nvetoes, and this Court\u2019s pre-Civil-War precedent per\nsuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was\nnecessary to provide full protection for the rights of\nblacks.24 Today, it is generally accepted that the Four\nteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitu\ntional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil\nRights Act of 1866. See General Building Contractors\nAssn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389 (1982); see\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi, Two Cheers for\nProfessor Balkin\u2019s Originalism, 103 Nw.

One of these, he said, was the right to keep\nand bear arms:\n       \u201cEvery man . . . should have the right to bear arms\n     for the defense of himself and family and his home\n     stead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken\n     open and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as\n     were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded\n     musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the pol\n     luted wretch to another world, where his wretched\n     ness will forever remain complete.\u201d Ibid.\nEven those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment\nunnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, \u201chave equal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   24 For example, at least one southern court had held the Civil Rights\n\nAct to be unconstitutional.

In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament\nof freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the\nnecessity of the right: \u201cDisarm a community and you rob\nthem of the means of defending life.

Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to\nthe right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued\ndisarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,\nFreedmen 120\u2013131. Finally, legal commentators from the\nperiod emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.\nSee, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the\nUnited States of America \u00a7118, p. 145 (1867) (reprint\n1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional\nLaw of the United States \u00a7239, pp. 152\u2013153 (3d ed. 1875).\n  The right to keep and bear arms was also widely pro\ntected by state constitutions at the time when the Four\nteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    25 Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the\n\nright to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures.

Indeed, the bill\n\u201cultimately passed in a form that disbanded militias but maintained\nthe right of individuals to their private firearms.\u201d Cramer 858.\n30                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexplicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms. See\nCalabresi & Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Consti\ntutions when the Fourteenth Amendment was Ratified in\n1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American His\ntory and Tradition? 87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50 (2008).26 Quite\na few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover,\nexplicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an\nindividual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I,\n\u00a728 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, \u00a717 (1818); Ky. Const.,\nArt. XIII, \u00a725 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, \u00a77 (1850);\nMiss. Const., Art. I, \u00a715 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, \u00a78\n(1865); Tex. Const., Art. I, \u00a713 (1869); see also Mont.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a713 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, \u00a724\n(1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, \u00a724 (1889); see also State v.\nMcAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is\nmore, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruc\ntion era by former Confederate States included a right to\nkeep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, \u00a75\n(1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, \u00a715 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,\n\u00a713 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, there\nfore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being\namong the foundational rights necessary to our system of\nGovernment.27\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 More generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven\nother States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See\nCalabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52.\n  27 These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law\n\nenforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that\ndid not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not\npursue criminals beyond the town borders. See Brief for Rocky Moun\ntain Gun Owners et al. as Amici Curiae 15. Settlers in the West and\nelsewhere, therefore, were left to \u201crepe[l] force by force when the\nintervention of society . . .

The settlers\u2019 dependence on game for\nfood and economic livelihood, moreover, undoubtedly undergirded these\nstate constitutional guarantees. See id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip. op, at 26,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the\nFourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and\nbear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to\nour system of ordered liberty.\n                             2\n   Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents con\ntend that Congress, in the years immediately following the\nCivil War, merely sought to outlaw \u201cdiscriminatory meas\nures taken against freedmen, which it addressed by adopt\ning a non-discrimination principle\u201d and that even an\noutright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as\nacceptable, \u201cso long as it was not done in a discriminatory\nmanner.\u201d Brief for Municipal Respondents 7. They argue\nthat Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \u00a71 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment \u201cas an antidiscrimination\nrule,\u201d and they cite statements to the effect that the sec\ntion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.\nThis argument is implausible.\n   First, while \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains\n\u201can antidiscrimination rule,\u201d namely, the Equal Protection\nClause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that \u00a71\ndoes no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were\nso, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,\nwould not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the\nrights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the\nFourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not\nprohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only\ndiscriminatory searches and seizures\u2014and so on. We\nassume that this is not municipal respondents\u2019 view, so\nwhat they must mean is that the Second Amendment\nshould be singled out for special\u2014and specially unfavor\nable\u2014treatment. We reject that suggestion.\n   Second, municipal respondents\u2019 argument ignores the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n36, 42).\n32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclear terms of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which\nacknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If\nthat law had used language such as \u201cthe equal benefit of\nlaws concerning the bearing of arms,\u201d it would be possible\nto interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina\ntion. But \u00a714 speaks of and protects \u201cthe constitutional\nright to bear arms,\u201d an unmistakable reference to the\nright protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro\ntects the \u201cfull and equal benefit\u201d of this right in the States.\n14 Stat. 176\u2013177. It would have been nonsensical for\nCongress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a\nconstitutional right that does not exist.\n   Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those\nlaws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous\ncondition of servitude, African Americans in the South\nwould likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many\nof their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace\nofficers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,\na law banning the possession of guns by all private citi\nzens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for\nmal sense. Any such law\u2014like the Chicago and Oak Park\nordinances challenged here\u2014presumably would have\npermitted the possession of guns by those acting under the\nauthority of the State and would thus have left firearms in\nthe hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as\nthe Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction\nrevealed, see supra, at 24\u201325, those groups were widely\ninvolved in harassing blacks in the South.\n   Fourth, municipal respondents\u2019 purely antidiscrimina\ntion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the\nplight of whites in the South who opposed the Black\nCodes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had\nsimply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the\nbearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have\nbeen left without the means of self-defense\u2014as had aboli\ntionists in Kansas in the 1850\u2019s.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  Fifth, the 39th Congress\u2019 response to proposals to dis\nband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive.\nDespite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these\nmilitias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm\nthem. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,\nsupra, 20\u201321. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate\nthe members\u2019 right to bear arms, and it was ultimately\ndecided to disband the militias but not to disarm their\nmembers. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \u00a76, 14 Stat. 485, 487;\nHalbrook, Freedmen 68\u201369; Cramer 858\u2013861. It cannot\nbe doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a\nsubstantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded\nmanner.\n                             IV\n  Municipal respondents\u2019 remaining arguments are at war\nwith our central holding in Heller: that the Second\nAmendment protects a personal right to keep and bear\narms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense\nwithin the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us\nto treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class\nright, subject to an entirely different body of rules than\nthe other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be\nincorporated into the Due Process Clause.\n  Municipal respondents\u2019 main argument is nothing less\nthan a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece\ndent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by\ngone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due\nProcess Clause protects only those rights \u201c \u2018recognized by\nall temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and\nuniversal sense of [their] justice.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,\nat 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi\nble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not\nrecognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause\n34                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndoes not make that right binding on the States. Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 9. Therefore, the municipal re\nspondents continue, because such countries as England,\nCanada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxem\nbourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit\nhandgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess\nsuch weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId., at 21\u201323.\n  This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the\nlong-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.\nSee Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14. And the pre\nsent-day implications of municipal respondents\u2019 argument\nare stunning. For example, many of the rights that our\nBill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal\noffenses are virtually unique to this country.28 If our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  28 For example, the United States affords criminal jury trials far more\nbroadly than other countries. See, e.g., Van Kessel, Adversary Excesses\nin the American Criminal Trial, 67 Notre Dame L. Rev. 403 (1992);\nLeib, A Comparison of Criminal Jury Decision Rules in Democratic\nCountries, 5 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 629, 630 (2008); Henderson, The\nWrongs of Victim\u2019s Rights, 37 Stan. L.

Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 10, n. 3. But even in this trimmed form,\nmunicipal respondents\u2019 argument flies in the face of more\nthan a half-century of precedent. For example, in Everson\nv. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 8 (1947), the Court\nheld that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment. Yet sev\neral of the countries that municipal respondents recognize\nas civilized have established state churches.29 If we were\nto adopt municipal respondents\u2019 theory, all of this Court\u2019s\nEstablishment Clause precedents involving actions taken\nby state and local governments would go by the boards.\n   Municipal respondents maintain that the Second\nAmendment differs from all of the other provisions of the\nBill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion rules).\n   29 England and Denmark have state churches.

All of the constitutional provisions\nthat impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the\nprosecution of crimes fall into the same category. See, e.g.,\nHudson v. Michigan, 547 U.

Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 18\u201320, 23.\n   There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to\nrespect federalism and allow useful state experimentation,\na federal constitutional right should not be fully binding\non the States. This argument was made repeatedly and\neloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the\nconcept of incorporation and urged retention of the two\ntrack approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of\n\u201cselective incorporation,\u201d Justice Harlan in particular,\ninvoking the values of federalism and state experimenta\ntion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the\ntwo-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354\nU.

Florida, 399\nU. S. 78, 117 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and\nconcurring in result in part).\n   Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we\nturn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test\napplicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal\nrespondents\u2019 argument must be rejected. Under our prece\ndents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an\nAmerican perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels\n38                     MCDONALD v.

See Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(indictment); Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211\n(1916) (civil jury).\n   As a result of Hurtado, most States do not require a grand jury\nindictment in all felony cases, and many have no grand juries.

We repeat those assurances here.\nDespite municipal respondents\u2019 doomsday proclamations,\nincorporation does not imperil every law regulating\nfirearms.\n   Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to\nkeep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in\nthe first eight Amendments \u201cbecause the reason for codify\ning the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs\nfrom the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in\nself-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in\nthe concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Brief for Municipal Re\nspondents 36\u201337. Municipal respondents suggest that the\nSecond Amendment right differs from the rights hereto\nfore incorporated because the latter were \u201cvalued for\n[their] own sake.\u201d Id., at 33. But we have never previ\nously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on\nwhether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,\nand quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo\nrated\u2014for example the right to counsel and the right to\nconfront and subpoena witnesses\u2014are clearly instrumen\ntal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages\none of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,\nthat the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined\nby the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that\nright in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that\nthe codification of this right was prompted by fear that the\nFederal Government would disarm and thus disable the\nmilitias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was\nvalued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). On the contrary, we stressed\nthat the right was also valued because the possession of\nfirearms was thought to be essential for self-defense.

S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).\nThe question presented in this case, in his view, \u201cis\nwhether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap\nplies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment\nitself, standing on its own bottom.\u201d Post, at 27. He would\nhold that \u201c[t]he rights protected against state infringe\nment by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\nneed not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro\ntected against Federal Government infringement by the\nvarious provisions of the Bill of Rights.\u201d Post, at 9.\n   As we have explained, the Court, for the past half\ncentury, has moved away from the two-track approach. If\nwe were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 theory across the\nboard, decades of decisions would be undermined. We\nassume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged\ninstead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for\nthe individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous\ndissents.\n   The relationship between the Bill of Rights\u2019 guarantees\nand the States must be governed by a single, neutral\nprinciple. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren\nnan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as \u201cthe\nnotion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the\nStates only a watered-down, subjective version of the\nindividual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\u201d Malloy,\nsupra, at 10\u201311 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n42                MCDONALD v.

To begin, while there is certainly room\nfor disagreement about Heller\u2019s analysis of the history of\nthe right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since\nHeller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.\nFew other questions of original meaning have been as\nthoroughly explored.\n   JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s conclusion that the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the right to keep and\nbear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,\n\u201cthere is no popular consensus\u201d that the right is funda\nmental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi\nnorities or persons neglected by those holding political\npower, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second\nAmendment right would \u201camount to a significant incur\nsion on a traditional and important area of state concern,\naltering the constitutional relationship between the States\nand the Federal Government\u201d and preventing local varia\ntions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right in cases involving state and\nlocal laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical\nquestions regarding matters that are outside their area of\nexpertise, post, at 11\u201316. Even if we believed that these\nfactors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of\nthese factors undermines the case for incorporation of the\nright to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n   First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of\nRights applies to the States only if there is a \u201cpopular\nconsensus\u201d that the right is fundamental, and we see no\nbasis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,\nthere is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief\nsubmitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members\nof the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the\nright to keep and bear arms is fundamental.

Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.\n  Second, petitioners and many others who live in high\ncrime areas dispute the proposition that the Second\nAmendment right does not protect minorities and those\nlacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in\nhigh-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi\nnois legislators representing Chicago districts called on\nthe Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to\npatrol the City\u2019s streets.31 The legislators noted that the\nnumber of Chicago homicide victims during the current\nyear equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur\ning that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that\n80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting\nincorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend\nthat the right is especially important for women and\nmembers of other groups that may be especially vulner\nable to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their\nsafety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the\ncommunity would be enhanced by the possession of hand\nguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second\nAmendment right protects the rights of minorities and\nother residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not\nbeing met by elected public officials.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 See Mack & Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to\n\nChicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.\n  32 Janssen & Knowles, Send in Troops?

Incorpora\ntion always restricts experimentation and local variations,\nbut that has not stopped the Court from incorporating\nvirtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. \u201c[T]he\nenshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes\ncertain policy choices off the table.\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable\nwith respect to the Second Amendment than it is with\nrespect to all the other limitations on state power found in\nthe Constitution.\n   Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation\nwill require judges to assess the costs and benefits of\nfirearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical\njudgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we\nhave noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an\ninterest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that\nsuggestion. See supra, at 38\u201339. \u201cThe very enumeration\nof the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even\nthe Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on\na case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth\ninsisting upon.\u201d Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62\u201363).\n                        *    *    *\n  In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects\nthe right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose\nof self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis\ncounsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that\nprotects a right that is fundamental from an American\nperspective applies equally to the Federal Government\nand the States. See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14.\nWe therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amend\nment right recognized in Heller.

Oliver, 510 U. S.\n266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring). This case does\nnot require me to reconsider that view, since straightfor\u00ad\nward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it.\n   I write separately only to respond to some aspects of\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 dissent. Not that aspect which dis\u00ad\nagrees with the majority\u2019s application of our precedents to\nthis case, which is fully covered by the Court\u2019s opinion.\nBut much of what JUSTICE STEVENS writes is a broad\ncondemnation of the theory of interpretation which under\u00ad\nlies the Court\u2019s opinion, a theory that makes the traditions\nof our people paramount. He proposes a different theory,\nwhich he claims is more \u201ccautiou[s]\u201d and respectful of\nproper limits on the judicial role. Post, at 57. It is that\nclaim I wish to address.\n                           I\n                           A\n  After stressing the substantive dimension of what he\n2                    MCDONALD v.

For\nwhether Palko requires only that \u201ca fair and enlightened\nsystem of justice would be impossible without\u201d the right\nsought to be incorporated, 302 U. S., at 325, or requires in\naddition that the right be rooted in the \u201ctraditions and\nconscience of our people,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted), many of the rights JUSTICE STEVENS thinks are\nincorporated could not pass muster under either test:\nabortion, post, at 7 (citing Planned Parenthood of South\neastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847 (1992)); homosex\u00ad\nual sodomy, post, at 16 (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.

S. 390, 399\u2013403 (1923)), among others.\n  That JUSTICE STEVENS is not applying any version of\nPalko is clear from comparing, on the one hand, the rights\nhe believes are covered, with, on the other hand, his con\u00ad\nclusion that the right to keep and bear arms is not cov\u00ad\nered. Rights that pass his test include not just those\n\u201crelating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family\nrelationships, and child rearing and education,\u201d but also\nrights against \u201c[g]overnment action that shocks the con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 I do not entirely understand JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 renaming of the Due\n\nProcess Clause. What we call it, of course, does not change what the\nClause says, but shorthand should not obscure what it says. Accepting\nfor argument\u2019s sake the shift in emphasis\u2014from avoiding certain\ndeprivations without that \u201cprocess\u201d which is \u201cdue,\u201d to avoiding the\ndeprivations themselves\u2014the Clause applies not just to deprivations of\n\u201cliberty,\u201d but also to deprivations of \u201clife\u201d and even \u201cproperty.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Exactly what is covered is\nnot clear. But whatever else is in, he knows that the right\nto keep and bear arms is out, despite its being as \u201cdeeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), as a right can be, see District of\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.

I can find no\nother explanation for such certitude except that JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, despite his forswearing of \u201cpersonal and private\nnotions,\u201d post, at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted),\ndeeply believes it should be out.\n   The subjective nature of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 standard is\nalso apparent from his claim that it is the courts\u2019 preroga\u00ad\ntive\u2014indeed their duty\u2014to update the Due Process Clause\nso that it encompasses new freedoms the Framers were\ntoo narrow-minded to imagine, post, at 19\u201320, and n. 21.\nCourts, he proclaims, must \u201cdo justice to [the Clause\u2019s]\nurgent call and its open texture\u201d by exercising the \u201cinter\u00ad\npretive discretion the latter embodies.\u201d Post, at 21.

Plenty indeed\u2014and\nthat alone is a problem. The ability of omnidirectional\nguideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their\nnumber. But even individually, each lodestar or limitation\nhe lists either is incapable of restraining judicial whimsy\nor cannot be squared with the precedents he seeks to\npreserve.\n   He begins with a brief nod to history, post, at 21, but as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER is not worried by that prospect. His interpretive\n\napproach applied to incorporation of the Second Amendment includes\nconsideration of such factors as \u201cthe extent to which incorporation will\nfurther other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent\nto which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution\u2019s struc\u00ad\ntural aims\u201d; whether recognizing a particular right will \u201cfurther the\nConstitution\u2019s effort to ensure that the government treats each individ\u00ad\nual with equal respect\u201d or will \u201chelp maintain the democratic form of\ngovernment\u201d; whether it is \u201cinconsistent . . . with the Constitution\u2019s\nefforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying\nout of its constitutional promises\u201d; whether it fits with \u201cthe Framers\u2019\nbasic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial\nreview\u201d; courts\u2019 comparative advantage in answering empirical ques\u00ad\ntions that may be involved in applying the right; and whether there is a\n\u201cstrong offsetting justification\u201d for removing a decision from the democ\u00ad\nratic process.

Moreover, trusting the meaning\nof the Due Process Clause to what has historically been\nprotected is circular, see post, at 19, since that would\nmean no new rights could get in.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS moves on to the \u201cmost basic\u201d con\u00ad\nstraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would\n\u201cesche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down,\ntotalizing theory of \u2018liberty.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22. The notion that\nthe absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause\nwill somehow curtail judicial caprice is at war with reason.\nIndeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose\nwhatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution.\nThe idea that interpretive pluralism would reduce courts\u2019\nability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not\nmerely na\u00efve, but absurd. If there are no right answers,\nthere are no wrong answers either.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that requiring courts to\nshow \u201crespect for the democratic process\u201d should serve as\na constraint. Post, at 23. That is true, but JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would have them show respect in an extraordi\u00ad\nnary manner. In his view, if a right \u201cis already being\ngiven careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing\ncalibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. In other words, a right, such as the\nright to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized\nbut on which the States are considering restrictions, ap\u00ad\nparently deserves less protection, while a privilege the\npolitical branches (instruments of the democratic process)\nhave withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves\nmore. That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accom\u00ad\nplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court\nheld protected in Casey, Lawrence, and other such cases fit\nthe theory\u2014but at the cost of insulting rather than re\u00ad\nspecting the democratic process.\n  The next constraint JUSTICE STEVENS suggests is harder\n6                  MCDONALD v.

I cannot say whether\nthat sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no\nidea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges\nwhen they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges\nare more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic\nconflict between liberty and its potentially harmful conse\u00ad\nquences? Attempting to give the concept more precision,\nJUSTICE STEVENS explains that \u201csensitivity is an aspect of\na deeper principle: the need to approach our work with\nhumility and caution.\u201d Ibid. Both traits are undeniably\nadmirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is\na mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case\nJUSTICE STEVENS cites in support, see ibid., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful\nform of judicial modesty in mind.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS offers no examples to illustrate the\nnext constraint: stare decisis, post, at 25. But his view of it\nis surely not very confining, since he holds out as a \u201cca\u00ad\nnonical\u201d exemplar of the proper approach, see post, at 16,\n54, Lawrence, which overruled a case decided a mere 17\nyears earlier, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986),\nsee 539 U. S., at 578 (it \u201cwas not correct when it was\ndecided, and it is not correct today\u201d). Moreover, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would apply that constraint unevenly: He appar\u00ad\nently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot\u00ad\nfor-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal\ndefendants, post, at 11, but would abandon those Warren\nCourt rulings that undercut his approach to substantive\nrights, on the basis that we have \u201ccut back\u201d on cases from\nthat era before, post, at 12.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also relies on the requirement of a\n\u201ccareful description of the asserted fundamental liberty\ninterest\u201d to limit judicial discretion. Post, at 25 (internal\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nquotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that\nrequirement, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993),\nthough some cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have not\napplied it seriously, see, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 562\n(\u201cThe instant case involves liberty of the person both in its\nspatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\u201d). But if\nthe \u201ccareful description\u201d requirement is used in the man\u00ad\nner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of\ndetermining the Due Process Clause\u2019s \u201cconceptual core,\u201d\npost, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we\nsought a careful, specific description of the right at issue\nin order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly\ndefined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 722\u2013728; Reno, supra, at 302\u2013306; Collins v.\nHarker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125\u2013129 (1992); Cruzan v.\nDirector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269\u2013279\n(1990); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 801\u2013808\n(1997). The threshold step of defining the asserted right\nwith precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as\nJUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the \u201cconceptual core\u201d of the\n\u201cliberty clause,\u201d post, at 23, includes a number of capa\u00ad\ncious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define\nthe right with much precision in order to conclude that it\npertains to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cability independently to define\n[his] identity,\u201d his \u201cright to make certain unusually impor\u00ad\ntant decisions that will affect his own, or his family\u2019s,\ndestiny,\u201d or some aspect of his \u201c[s]elf-determination, bodily\nintegrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,\npolitical equality, dignity [or] respect.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there\u00ad\nfore have in mind some other use for the careful\u00ad\ndescription requirement\u2014perhaps just as a means of\nensuring that courts \u201cprocee[d] slowly and incrementally,\u201d\npost, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by\n8                      MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nhaving them draft their opinions in longhand.4\n                              II\n  If JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 account of the constraints of his\napproach did not demonstrate that they do not exist, his\napplication of that approach to the case before us leaves no\ndoubt. He offers several reasons for concluding that the\nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not\nfundamental enough to be applied against the States.5\nNone is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose,\neach is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude\nincorporation of rights we have already held incorporated,\nor both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a\njudge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 After\n          defending the careful-description criterion, JUSTICE STEVENS\nquickly retreats and cautions courts not to apply it too stringently.\nPost, at 26. Describing a right too specifically risks robbing it of its\n\u201cuniversal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have,\u201d ibid.,\nand \u201cloads the dice against its recognition,\u201d post, at 26, n. 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That must be avoided, since it endangers\nrights JUSTICE STEVENS does like. See ibid. (discussing Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003)). To make sure those rights get in, we must\nleave leeway in our description, so that a right that has not itself been\nrecognized as fundamental can ride the coattails of one that has been.\n  5 JUSTICE STEVENS claims that I mischaracterize his argument by\n\nreferring to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\ninstead of \u201cthe interest in keeping a firearm of one\u2019s choosing in the\nhome,\u201d the right he says petitioners assert. Post, at 38, n. 36. But it is\nprecisely the \u201cSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms\u201d that\npetitioners argue is incorporated by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,\nPet. for Cert. i. Under JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 own approach, that should end\nthe matter. See post, at 26 (\u201c[W]e must pay close attention to the\nprecise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate\u201d). In\nany event, the demise of watered-down incorporation, see ante, at 17\u2013\n19, means that we no longer subdivide Bill of Rights guarantees into\ntheir theoretical components, only some of which apply to the States.\nThe First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated\u2014not the\nfreedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\n\u201cfirearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship\nto liberty,\u201d since sometimes they are used to cause (or\nsometimes accidentally produce) injury to others. Post, at\n35. The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liber\u00ad\nties deserve Due Process protection is never explained\u2014\nproof that judges applying JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 approach can\nadd new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion,\nmoreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely JUSTICE\nSTEVENS does not mean that the Clause covers only rights\nthat have zero harmful effect on anyone. Otherwise even\nthe First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is\nthat the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a\nrisk to others\u2019 physical well-being. But as the plurality\nexplains, ante, at 35\u201336, other rights we have already held\nincorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public\nsafety. In all events, JUSTICE STEVENS supplies neither a\nstandard for how severe the impairment on others\u2019 liberty\nmust be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any\nmethod of measuring the severity.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next suggests that the Second\nAmendment right is not fundamental because it is \u201cdiffer\u00ad\nent in kind\u201d from other rights we have recognized. Post, at\n37. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear\narms is different from some other rights we have held the\nClause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply\ngrounded in our nation\u2019s history and tradition. But\nJUSTICE STEVENS has a different distinction in mind:\nEven though he does \u201cnot doubt for a moment that many\nAmericans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life\nas well as to their security,\u201d he pronounces that owning a\nhandgun is not \u201ccritical to leading a life of autonomy,\ndignity, or political equality.\u201d6 Post, at 37\u201338. Who says?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 JUSTICE STEVENS goes a step farther still, suggesting that the right\n\nto keep and bear arms is not protected by the \u201cliberty clause\u201d because it\nis not really a liberty at all, but a \u201cproperty right.\u201d Post, at 38. Never\n10                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDeciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled\nlife is an inherently political, moral judgment\u2014the an\u00ad\ntithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions\nby applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.7\n   No determination of what rights the Constitution of the\nUnited States covers would be complete, of course, without\na survey of what other countries do. Post, at 40\u201341. When\nit comes to guns, JUSTICE STEVENS explains, our Nation is\nalready an outlier among \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d; not\neven our \u201coldest allies\u201d protect as robust a right as we do,\nand we should not widen the gap. Ibid. Never mind that\nhe explains neither which countries qualify as \u201cadvanced\ndemocracies\u201d nor why others are irrelevant. For there is\nan even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges\npick which rights States must respect and those they can\nignore: As the plurality shows, ante, at 34\u201335, and nn. 28\u2013\n29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would fore\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; and\nnever mind that the \u201cliberty clause\u201d is really a Due Process Clause\nwhich explicitly protects \u201cproperty,\u201d see United States v. Carlton, 512\nU. S. 26, 41\u201342 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 theory cannot explain why the Takings Clause, which unques\u00ad\ntionably protects property, has been incorporated, see Chicago, B. & Q.\nR. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 241 (1897), in a decision he appears to\naccept, post, at 14, n. 14.\n   7 As JUSTICE STEVENS notes, see post, at 51\u201352, I accept as a matter of\n\nstare decisis the requirement that to be fundamental for purposes of the\nDue Process Clause, a right must be \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty,\u201d Lawrence, supra, at 593, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But that inquiry provides infinitely less\nscope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court\u2019s ap\u00ad\nproach, since the field of candidates is immensely narrowed by the prior\nrequirement that a right be rooted in this country\u2019s traditions. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that\nhe thinks \u201cimplicit in the concept, etc.\u201d The point JUSTICE STEVENS\nmakes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical\napproach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than\nhis in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so. See\nPart III, infra.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

A judge applying JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 approach must either throw all of those rights\noverboard or, as cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have\ndone in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore\nforeign law when it undermines the desired conclusion,\nsee, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (making no mention of\nforeign law).\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that since the right to\nkeep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of \u201cpre\u00ad\nvent[ing] elimination of the militia,\u201d it should be viewed as\n\u201c \u2018a federalism provision\u2019 \u201d logically incapable of incorpora\u00ad\ntion. Post, at 41\u201342 (quoting Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., con\u00ad\ncurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks\nomitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when\njudges want it to. The opinion JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nfor the \u201cfederalism provision\u201d principle, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\nconcurrence in Newdow, argued that incorporation of the\nEstablishment Clause \u201cmakes little sense\u201d because that\nClause was originally understood as a limit on congres\u00ad\nsional interference with state establishments of religion.\nId., at 49\u201351. JUSTICE STEVENS, of course, has no problem\nwith applying the Establishment Clause to the States.\nSee, e.g., id., at 8, n. 4 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS,\nJ.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause\n\u201cappl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment\u201d). While he insists that Clause is not a\n\u201cfederalism provision,\u201d post, at 42, n. 40, he does not ex\u00ad\nplain why it is not, but the right to keep and bear arms is\n(even though only the latter refers to a \u201cright of the peo\u00ad\nple\u201d). The \u201cfederalism\u201d argument prevents the incorpora\u00ad\ntion of only certain rights.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next argues that even if the right to\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nkeep and bear arms is \u201cdeeply rooted in some important\nsenses,\u201d the roots of States\u2019 efforts to regulate guns run\njust as deep. Post, at 44 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). But this too is true of other rights we have held\nincorporated. No fundamental right\u2014not even the First\nAmendment\u2014is absolute. The traditional restrictions go\nto show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental\ncharacter. At least that is what they show (JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would agree) for other rights. Once again, prin\u00ad\nciples are applied selectively.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 final reason for rejecting incorpora\u00ad\ntion of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than\nany of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that\nthere is a \u201cplausible constitutional basis\u201d for holding that\nthe right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts\nthat we ought not to do so for prudential reasons. Post, at\n47. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that\nare within the Constitution\u2019s command (and we assuredly\ndo not), two of the reasons JUSTICE STEVENS gives for\nabstention show just how much power he would hand to\njudges. The States\u2019 \u201cright to experiment\u201d with solutions to\nthe problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here\nbecause \u201cthe best solution is far from clear.\u201d Post, at 47\u2013\n48 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is true of\nmost serious social problems\u2014whether, for example, \u201cthe\nbest solution\u201d for rampant crime is to admit confessions\nunless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced,\nbut see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 444\u2013445\n(1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty\nwithout a requirement that they be free to consider \u201cany\nrelevant mitigating factor,\u201d see Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\nU. S. 104, 112 (1982), which in turn leads to the conclusion\nthat defense counsel has provided inadequate defense if he\nhas not conducted a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d into poten\u00ad\ntially mitigating factors, see, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S. 510, 534 (2003), inquiry into which question tends to\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. ___ (2009) (per curiam) (reversing\ngrant of habeas relief for sentencing on a crime committed\nin 1981). The obviousness of the optimal answer is in the\neye of the beholder. The implication of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019\ncall for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that\nThey The People\u2019s answers to a problem are silly, we are\nfree to \u201cinterven[e],\u201d post, at 47, but if we too are uncertain\nof the right answer, or merely think the States may be on\nto something, we can loosen the leash.\n   A second reason JUSTICE STEVENS says we should ab\u00ad\nstain is that the States have shown they are \u201ccapable\u201d of\nprotecting the right at issue, and if anything have pro\u00ad\ntected it too much. Post, at 49. That reflects an assump\u00ad\ntion that judges can distinguish between a proper democ\u00ad\nratic decision to leave things alone (which we should\nhonor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we\nshould step in to correct). I would not\u2014and no judge\nshould\u2014presume to have that sort of omniscience, which\nseems to me far more \u201carrogant,\u201d post, at 41, than confin\u00ad\ning courts\u2019 focus to our own national heritage.\n                              III\n   JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 response to this concurrence, post, at\n51\u201356, makes the usual rejoinder of \u201cliving Constitution\u201d\nadvocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to\neliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The\ntraditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes\ndiscretion in judges as well.8 Historical analysis can be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS also asserts that his approach is \u201cmore faithful to\nthis Nation\u2019s constitutional history\u201d and to \u201cthe values and commit\u00ad\nments of the American people, as they stand today,\u201d post, at 54. But\nwhat he asserts to be the proof of this is that his approach aligns (no\nsurprise) with those cases he approves (and dubs \u201ccanonical,\u201d ibid.).\nCases he disfavors are discarded as \u201chardly bind[ing]\u201d \u201cexcesses,\u201d post,\nat 12, or less \u201cenduring,\u201d post, at 17, n. 16. Not proven. Moreover,\nwhatever relevance JUSTICE STEVENS ascribes to current \u201cvalues and\n14                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ndifficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold ques\u00ad\ntions, and making nuanced judgments about which evi\u00ad\ndence to consult and how to interpret it.\n   I will stipulate to that.9 But the question to be decided\nis not whether the historically focused method is a perfect\nmeans of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution\u00ad\nwriting; but whether it is the best means available in an\nimperfect world. Or indeed, even more narrowly than\nthat: whether it is demonstrably much better than what\nJUSTICE STEVENS proposes. I think it beyond all serious\ndispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much\nless upon the democratic process. It is less subjective\nbecause it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of\nreasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico\u00ad\npolitical First Principles whose combined conclusion can\nbe found to point in any direction the judges favor. In the\nmost controversial matters brought before this Court\u2014for\nexample, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion,\nassisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitu\u00ad\ntionality of the death penalty\u2014any historical methodology,\nunder any plausible standard of proof, would lead to the\nsame conclusion.10 Moreover, the methodological differ\u00ad\nences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncommitments of the American people\u201d (and that is unclear, see post, at\n48\u201349, n. 47), it is hard to see how it shows fidelity to them that he\ndisapproves a different subset of old cases than the Court does.\n   9 That is not to say that every historical question on which there is\n\nroom for debate is indeterminate, or that every question on which\nhistorians disagree is equally balanced. Cf. post, at 52\u201353. For exam\u00ad\nple, the historical analysis of the principal dissent in Heller is as valid\nas the Court\u2019s only in a two-dimensional world that conflates length\nand depth.\n   10 By the way, JUSTICE STEVENS greatly magnifies the difficulty of an\n\nhistorical approach by suggesting that it was my burden in Lawrence to\nshow the \u201cancient roots of proscriptions against sodomy,\u201d post, at 53\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Au contraire, it was his burden (in\nthe opinion he joined) to show the ancient roots of the right of sodomy.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

And\nwhether or not special expertise is needed to answer his\u00ad\ntorical questions, judges most certainly have no \u201ccompara\u00ad\ntive . . . advantage,\u201d post, at 24 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), in resolving moral disputes. What is more, his\napproach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard\nquestions courts must confront, since he would not replace\nhistory with moral philosophy, but would have courts\nconsider both.\n   And the Court\u2019s approach intrudes less upon the democ\u00ad\nratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those\nestablished by a constitutional history formed by democ\u00ad\nratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are\nleft to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,\nwith the assurance that their decision is not subject to\njudicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 approach, on the\nother hand, deprives the people of that power, since what\u00ad\never the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro\u00ad\ntected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After\nall, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at\n55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.\nJUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which \u201cmajorities or\npowerful interest groups always get their way,\u201d post, at 56,\nbut replaces it with a system in which unelected and life\u00ad\ntenured judges always get their way.

But I cannot agree that it is enforceable against the\nStates through a clause that speaks only to \u201cprocess.\u201d\nInstead, the right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of\nAmerican citizenship that applies to the States through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\nClause.\n2                  MCDONALD v.

CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely\ndivided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction be\ntween the privileges and immunities of state citizenship\nand those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter cate\ngory of rights from state abridgment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt defined that category to include only those rights\n\u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its\nNational character, its Constitution, or its laws.\u201d Id., at\n79. This arguably left open the possibility that certain\nindividual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be\nconsidered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.\nSee ibid. (listing \u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and\n\u201cthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d as rights poten\ntially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).\nBut the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly\nin its later cases.\n   Chief among those cases is United States v. Cruikshank,\n92 U. S. 542 (1876). There, the Court held that members\nof a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as\n165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse\nhad not deprived the victims of their privileges as Ameri\ncan citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear\narms. Ibid.; see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).\nAccording to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble\ncodified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of\nUnited States citizenship because \u201c[t]he right . . . existed\nlong before the adoption of the Constitution.\u201d 92 U. S., at\n551 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the\nright to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United\nStates citizenship because it was not \u201cin any manner\ndependent upon that instrument for its existence.\u201d Id., at\n553. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the\nright to bear arms in the Second Amendment\u2014its nature\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nas an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution\u2019s\nadoption\u2014was the very reason citizens could not enforce it\nagainst States through the Fourteenth.\n   That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court\u2019s\nlast word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.1 In the\nintervening years, the Court has held that the Clause\nprevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such\nas the right to travel, see Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 503\n(1999), that are not readily described as essential to\nliberty.\n   As a consequence of this Court\u2019s marginalization of the\nClause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental\nrights turned to the remainder of \u00a71 in search of an alter\nnative fount of such rights. They found one in a most\ncurious place\u2014that section\u2019s command that every State\nguarantee \u201cdue process\u201d to any person before depriving\nhim of \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d At first, litigants argued\nthat this Due Process Clause \u201cincorporated\u201d certain proce\ndural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the\nStates. The Court generally rejected those claims, how\never, on the theory that the rights in question were not\nsufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to warrant such treatment.\nSee, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v. Dow, 176\nU. S. 581 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); Twining v.\nNew Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908) (privilege against self\nincrimination).\n   That changed with time. The Court came to conclude\nthat certain Bill of Rights guarantees were sufficiently\nfundamental to fall within \u00a71\u2019s guarantee of \u201cdue process.\u201d\nThese included not only procedural protections listed in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In the two decades after United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542\n\n(1876), was decided, this Court twice reaffirmed its holding that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause does not apply the Second Amendment\nto the States. Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 266\u2013267 (1886); Miller\nv. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894).\n6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe first eight Amendments, see, e.g., Benton v. Maryland,\n395 U. S. 784 (1969) (protection against double jeopardy),\nbut substantive rights as well, see, e.g., Gitlow v. New\nYork, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925) (right to free speech); Near\nv. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 707 (1931)\n(same). In the process of incorporating these rights\nagainst the States, the Court often applied them differ\nently against the States than against the Federal Gov\nernment on the theory that only those \u201cfundamental\u201d\naspects of the right required Due Process Clause protec\ntion. See, e.g., Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 473 (1942)\n(holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appoint\nment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the\ndefendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the\nDue Process Clause required appointment of counsel in\nstate criminal cases only where \u201cwant of counsel . . . re\nsult[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fair\nness\u201d). In more recent years, this Court has \u201cabandoned\nthe notion\u201d that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply\ndifferently when incorporated against the States than they\ndo when applied to the Federal Government. Ante, at 17\u2013\n18 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a\nright is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only\nif it is sufficiently \u201cfundamental,\u201d ante, at 37, 42\u201344 (plu\nrality opinion)\u2014a term the Court has long struggled to\ndefine.\n   While this Court has at times concluded that a right\ngains \u201cfundamental\u201d status only if it is essential to the\nAmerican \u201cscheme of ordered liberty\u201d or \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in\nthis Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 19 (plurality\nopinion) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court\nhas just as often held that a right warrants Due Process\nClause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range\nof criteria, see Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562\n(2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Using the latter approach, the\nCourt has determined that the Due Process Clause applies\nrights against the States that are not mentioned in the\nConstitution at all, even without seriously arguing that\nthe Clause was originally understood to protect such\nrights. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905);\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Lawrence, supra.\n   All of this is a legal fiction. The notion that a constitu\ntional provision that guarantees only \u201cprocess\u201d before a\nperson is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define\nthe substance of those rights strains credulity for even the\nmost casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a\nparticularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the\nCourt\u2019s substantive due process precedents together is\ntheir lack of a guiding principle to distinguish \u201cfundamen\ntal\u201d rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental\nrights that do not. Today\u2019s decision illustrates the point.\nReplaying a debate that has endured from the inception of\nthe Court\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, the\ndissents laud the \u201cflexibility\u201d in this Court\u2019s substantive\ndue process doctrine, post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);\nsee post, at 6\u20138 (BREYER, J., dissenting), while the plural\nity makes yet another effort to impose principled re\nstraints on its exercise, see ante, at 33\u201341. But neither\nside argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due\nProcess Clause was consistent with public understanding\nat the time of its ratification.\n   To be sure, the plurality\u2019s effort to cabin the exercise of\njudicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focus\ning its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American\nhistory and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse\nthan the alternatives. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissent\ning) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against\nthe States through the Due Process Clause if they are\n\u201cwell-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional prom\n8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nises\u201d); post, at 22 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (warning that\nthere is no \u201call-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n\u2018liberty\u2019 \u201d protected by the Due Process Clause). But any\nserious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause\nmust acknowledge that neither its text nor its history\nsuggests that it protects the many substantive rights this\nCourt\u2019s cases now claim it does.\n   I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation\nthat rests on such tenuous footing. This Court\u2019s substan\ntive due process framework fails to account for both the\ntext of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that\nled to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence\ndevoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original mean\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alter\nnative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this\nCourt to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is\ndesigned to protect with greater clarity and predictability\nthan the substantive due process framework has so far\nmanaged.\n   I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been\nbuilt upon the substantive due process framework, and I\nfurther acknowledge the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation\u2019s legal system. But stare decisis is\nonly an \u201cadjunct\u201d of our duty as judges to decide by our\nbest lights what the Constitution means. Planned Par\nenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 963\n(1992) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). It is not \u201can inexorable com\nmand.\u201d Lawrence, supra, at 577. Moreover, as judges, we\ninterpret the Constitution one case or controversy at a\ntime. The question presented in this case is not whether\nour entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be\npreserved or revised, but only whether, and to what ex\ntent, a particular clause in the Constitution protects the\nparticular right at issue here. With the inquiry appropri\nately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

See 1\nB. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History\n8\u221216, 19\u221221, 41\u221246 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These\nfundamental rights, according to the English tradition,\nbelonged to all people but became legally enforceable only\nwhen recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parlia\nment and the decisions of common-law judges. See B.\nBailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolu\ntion 77\u221279 (1967). These rights included many that later\n12                     MCDONALD v.

S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 19) (\u201c[I]t has always been widely understood that\nthe Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amend\nments, codified a pre-existing right\u201d). The Court\u2019s subse\nquent decision in Barron, however, made plain that the\ncodification of these rights in the Bill made them legally\nenforceable only against the Federal Government, not the\nStates. See 7 Pet., at 247.\n                              3\n   Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the\nStates, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state\ninterference with individual rights.

In that case, a\nPennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law pro\nhibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the\nState\u2019s waters violated Article IV, \u00a72 because it deprived\nhim, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey\navailed to its own citizens. Id., at 550. Justice Washing\nton rejected that argument, refusing to \u201caccede to the\nproposition\u201d that Article IV, \u00a72 entitled \u201ccitizens of the\nseveral states . . . to participate in all the rights which\nbelong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular\nstate.\u201d Id., at 552 (emphasis added). In his view, Article\nIV, \u00a72 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits\na State might choose to make available to its citizens. See\nid., at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights \u201cwhich\nare, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right,\nto the citizens of all free governments.\u201d Id., at 551 (em\nphasis added).

On this question, the weight of\nlegal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated\nthat Article IV, \u00a72 prohibited States from discriminating\nagainst sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental\nrights, but did not require States to recognize those rights\nand did not prescribe their content.

Section 1 overruled Dred\nScott\u2019s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the\nUnited States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy\n\u201cthe privileges and immunities of citizens\u201d embodied in the\nConstitution. 19 How., at 417. The Court in Dred Scott\ndid not distinguish between privileges and immunities of\ncitizens of the United States and citizens in the several\nStates, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.\nIt did, however, give examples of what the rights of citi\nzens were\u2014the constitutionally enumerated rights of \u201cthe\nfull liberty of speech\u201d and the right \u201cto keep and carry\narms.\u201d Ibid.\n   Section 1 protects the rights of citizens \u201cof the United\nStates\u201d specifically.

In 1820, when the Missouri Terri\ntory (which the United States acquired through the Ces\nsion Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a\ndebate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within\nMissouri as a condition of its admission. Some congress\nmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would\ndeprive its inhabitants of the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d\nthey had been promised by the Cession Act. See, e.g., 35\nAnnals of Cong. 1083 (1855) (remarks of Kentucky Rep.\nHardin). But those who opposed slavery in Missouri\nargued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter\nof state property law, not one of the privileges and immu\nnities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Subsequent treaties contained similar guarantees that the inhabi\n\ntants of the newly acquired territories would enjoy the freedom to\nexercise certain constitutional rights.

In his \u201cMemorial to Congress,\u201d\nWebster argued that \u201c[t]he rights, advantages and immu\nnities here spoken of [in the Cession Act] must . . . be such\nas are recognized or communicated by the Constitution of\nthe United States,\u201d not the \u201crights, advantages and im\nmunities, derived exclusively from the State governments\n. . . .\u201d D.

In other words, Webster articulated a distinction\nbetween the rights of United States citizenship and the\nrights of state citizenship, and argued that the former\nincluded those rights \u201crecognized or communicated by the\nConstitution.\u201d Since the right to hold slaves was not\nmentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal\ncitizenship.\n   Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over\nslavery in Missouri and the territory was admitted as a\nslave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compro\nmise. Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820, ch. 22, \u00a78,\n3 Stat. 548.

That Committee\nwould ultimately recommend the adoption of the Four\nteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by\nsubmitting a report to Congress that extensively cata\nlogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States\nand argued that \u201cadequate security for future peace and\nsafety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic\nlaw as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all\ncitizens in all parts of the republic.\u201d See Report of the\nJoint Committee on Reconstruction, S.

Before considering that record here, it is\nimportant to clarify its relevance. When interpreting\nconstitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely\npublic understanding of a particular provision at the time\nit was adopted. Statements by legislators can assist in\nthis process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in\nwhich the public used or understood a particular word or\nphrase. They can further assist to the extent there is\nevidence that these statements were disseminated to the\npublic. In other words, this evidence is useful not because\nit demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have\nbeen thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the\npublic understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to\nmean.\n                             (1)\n  Three speeches stand out as particularly significant.\nRepresentative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of\n\u00a71, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in Febru\nary 1866 introducing his first draft of the provision. Bing\nham began by discussing Barron and its holding that the\nBill of Rights did not apply to the States.

A front-page article hailed the \u201cClear\nand Forcible Speech\u201d by Representative Robert Hale\nagainst the draft, explaining\u2014and endorsing\u2014Hale\u2019s view\nthat Bingham\u2019s proposal would \u201cconfer upon Congress all\nthe rights and power of legislation now reserved to the\nStates\u201d and would \u201cin effect utterly obliterate State rights\nand State authority over their own internal affairs.\u201d12\nN. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1.\n   Critically, Hale did not object to the draft insofar as it\npurported to protect constitutional liberties against state\ninterference. Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incor\nrectly in light of Barron) that individual rights enumer\nated in the Constitution were already enforceable against\nthe States. See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (\u201cI have, somehow\nor other, gone along with the impression that there is that\nsort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether\nwith or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we\nare so protected\u201d); see N.

In the\ninterim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech,\nagain arguing that a constitutional amendment was re\nquired to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of\nRights against the States.

Senator Jacob Howard introduced the\nnew draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech\nrelevant here.

CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that\n\u00a71 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared\nrights against the States, and they provide no suggestion\nthat any language in the section other than the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.\n                              (2)\n   When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legis\nlation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further sup\nports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amend\nment\u2014which outlawed slavery alone\u2014and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of\nlegislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\nwhich provided that \u201call persons born in the United\nStates\u201d were \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d and that \u201csuch\ncitizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same\nright\u201d to, among other things, \u201cfull and equal benefit of all\nlaws and proceedings for the security of person and prop\nerty, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d Ch. 31, \u00a71, 14 Stat.\n27.\n   Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it\nas providing the \u201cprivileges\u201d of citizenship to freedmen,\nand defined those privileges to include constitutional\nrights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th\nCong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that\nthe \u201cthe late slaveholding States\u201d had enacted laws \u201cde\npriving persons of African descent of privileges which are\nessential to freemen,\u201d including \u201cprohibit[ing] any negro or\nmulatto from having fire-arms\u201d and stating that \u201c[t]he\npurpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all\nthese discriminations\u201d); id., at 1266\u20131267 (remarks of Rep.\nRaymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to\n\u201c[m]ake a colored man a citizen of the United States\u201d\nwould guarantee to him, inter alia, \u201ca defined status . . . a\nright to defend himself and his wife and children; a right\nto bear arms\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  Three months later, Congress passed the Freedmen\u2019s\nBureau Act, which also entitled all citizens to the \u201cfull and\nequal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning per\nsonal liberty\u201d and \u201cpersonal security.\u201d Act of July 16,\n1866, ch. 200, \u00a714, 14 Stat. 176. The Act stated expressly\nthat the rights of personal liberty and security protected\nby the Act \u201cinclud[ed] the constitutional right to bear\narms.\u201d Ibid.\n                              (3)\n   There is much else in the legislative record. Many\nstatements by Members of Congress corroborate the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced consti\ntutionally enumerated rights against the States. See\nCurtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any\nstatement that directly refutes that proposition. That\nsaid, the record of the debates\u2014like most legislative his\ntory\u2014is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambi\nguity derives from the fact that at least several Members\ndescribed \u00a71 as protecting the privileges and immunities\nof citizens \u201cin the several States,\u201d harkening back to Arti\ncle IV, \u00a72. See supra, at 28\u201329 (describing Sen. Howard\u2019s\nspeech). These statements can be read to support the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or\nall the fundamental rights of \u201ccitizens\u201d described in Cor\nfield. They can also be read to support the view that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, \u00a72, pro\nhibits only state discrimination with respect to those\nrights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to\ndeny those rights to all citizens equally.\n   I examine the rest of the historical record with this\nunderstanding. But for purposes of discerning what the\npublic most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities\nClause to mean, it is significant that the most widely\npublicized statements by the legislators who voted on \u00a71\u2014\nBingham, Howard, and even Hale\u2014point unambiguously\n32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntoward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause enforces at least those fundamental rights enu\nmerated in the Constitution against the States, including\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n                               3\n   Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the\nperiod immediately following its ratification help to estab\nlish the public understanding of the text at the time of its\nadoption.\n   Some of these interpretations come from Members of\nCongress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes\nlisted the Constitution\u2019s first eight Amendments, includ\ning \u201cthe right to keep and bear arms,\u201d before explaining\nthat after the Civil War, the country \u201cgave the most grand\nof all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one\nsingle amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of\nAmerican citizens\u201d who formerly were slaves. Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475\u2013476 (1871). \u201cIt is all\nthese,\u201d Dawes explained, \u201cwhich are comprehended in the\nwords \u2018American citizen.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 334 (re\nmarks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immu\nnities Clause referred to those rights \u201cdeclared to belong to\nthe citizen by the Constitution itself\u201d). Even opponents of\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowl\nedged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected\nconstitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2\nCong. Rec. 384\u2013385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (oppos\ning enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to\nthe Bill of Rights, that \u201c[t]hese first amendments and\nsome provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace\nthe \u2018privileges and immunities\u2019 of citizenship as set forth\nin article 4, section 2 of the Constitution and in the four\nteenth amendment\u201d (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166\u2013170\n(collecting examples).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights\nAct of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part\n\u201cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d and\nwhich is codified in the still-existing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983.\nThat statute prohibits state officials from depriving citi\nzens of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\nthe Constitution.\u201d Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 (em\nphasis added). Although the Judiciary ignored this provi\nsion for decades after its enactment, this Court has come\nto interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text,\nas protecting constitutionally enumerated rights. Monroe\nv. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171 (1961).\n   A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future\nJustice of this Court adopted the same understanding of\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1824367\"><a href=\"/opinion/1824367/state-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As the Court demonstrates, there\ncan be no doubt that \u00a71 was understood to enforce the\nSecond Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22\u2013\n33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear\narms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen\nship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The municipal re\nspondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former\ninterpretation. They contend that the Second Amend\nment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth,\nauthorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun\npossession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State\napplies it to all citizens equally.15 The Court explains why\nthis antidiscrimination-only reading of \u00a71 as a whole is\n\u201cimplausible.\u201d Ante, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to\nthe States, I must explain why this Clause in particular\nprotects against more than just state discrimination, and\nin fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all\nAmerican citizens.\n                              1\n   I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immuni\nties Clause opens with the command that \u201cNo State shall\u201d\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The municipal respondents and JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s dissent raise a\n\nmost unusual argument that \u00a71 prohibits discriminatory laws affecting\nonly the right to keep and bear arms, but offers substantive protection\nto other rights enumerated in the Constitution, such as the freedom of\nspeech. See post, at 24. Others, however, have made the more compre\nhensive\u2014and internally consistent\u2014argument that \u00a71 bars discrimina\ntion alone and does not afford protection to any substantive rights. See,\ne.g., R. Berger, Government By Judiciary: The Transformation of the\nFourteenth Amendment (1997). I address the coverage of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause only as it applies to the Second Amendment\nright presented here, but I do so with the understanding that my\nconclusion may have implications for the broader argument.\n36                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nUnited States. Amdt. 14, \u00a71 (emphasis added). The very\nsame phrase opens Article I, \u00a710 of the Constitution,\nwhich prohibits the States from \u201cpass[ing] any Bill of\nAttainder\u201d or \u201cex post facto Law,\u201d among other things.\nArticle I, \u00a710 is one of the few constitutional provisions\nthat limits state authority. In Barron, when Chief Justice\nMarshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking \u201cplain\nand intelligible language\u201d restricting state power to in\nfringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, \u00a710\nas an example of text that would have accomplished that\ntask. 7 Pet., at 250. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would\nlater describe Article I, \u00a710 as \u201ca bill of rights for the\npeople of each state.\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138\n(1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause uses the command \u201c[n]o State shall\u201d\u2014which Arti\ncle IV, \u00a72 does not\u2014strongly suggests that the former\nimposes a greater restriction on state power than the\nlatter.\n   This interpretation is strengthened when one considers\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb\n\u201cabridge,\u201d rather than \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d to describe the limit\nit imposes on state authority. The Webster\u2019s dictionary in\nuse at the time of Reconstruction defines the word\n\u201cabridge\u201d to mean \u201c[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to\nabridge one of his rights.\u201d Webster, An American Diction\nary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best\nunderstood to impose a limitation on state power to in\nfringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no\nindication that the Framers of the Clause used the word\n\u201cabridge\u201d to prohibit only discrimination.\n   This most natural textual reading is underscored by a\nwell-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment\nthat the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several\nSouthern States refused to ratify the Amendment, Presi\ndent Johnson met with their Governors to draft a com\npromise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5.

Fleming ed. 1950)\n    (hereinafter Fleming).\n  Significantly, this proposal removed the \u201c[n]o State\nshall\u201d directive and the verb \u201cabridge\u201d from \u00a71, and also\nchanged the class of rights to be protected from those\nbelonging to \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d to those of the\n\u201ccitizens in the several States.\u201d This phrasing is materi\nally indistinguishable from Article IV, \u00a72, which gener\nally was understood as an antidiscrimination provision\nalone. See supra, at 15\u201318. The proposal thus strongly\nindicates that at least the President of the United States\nand several southern Governors thought that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully\ntried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored\ndiscrimination.\n                              2\n  The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by\na claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of \u00a71\ngenerally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argu\nment goes, \u00a71 must not have been understood to accom\nplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal\nenforcement of a minimum baseline of rights. That argu\nment overlooks critical aspects of the Nation\u2019s history that\nunderscored the need for, and wide agreement upon,\n38                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfederal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights\nagainst the States, including the right to keep and bear\narms.\n                               a\n   I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification. It\nis true that the congressional debates over \u00a71 were rela\ntively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of\nextensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures\ndid not keep records of their debates, and the few records\nthat do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis\n145. These facts are not surprising.\n   First, however consequential we consider the question\ntoday, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not\nthe most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend\nment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just\nendured a tumultuous civil war, and \u00a7\u00a72, 3, and 4\u2014which\nreduced the representation of States that denied voting\nrights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers\nof the power to hold elective office, and required States to\ndisavow Confederate war debts\u2014were far more polarizing\nand consumed far more political attention. See Wilden\nthal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the\nFourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866\u20131868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).\n   Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth\nAmendment reveal that many representatives, and proba\nbly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend\nment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina\ntion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights\nagainst the States. Justice Black\u2019s dissent in Adamson\nchronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107\u2013108\n(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether\nthat understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu\ntional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little\nto say during the debates about \u00a71.

Like the Framers, see supra, at 14\u201315, many 19th\ncentury Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare\ninalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,\neven though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to\nthe Federal Government, many believed that it declared\nrights that no legitimate government could abridge.\n   Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin\u2019s decision for the Georgia\nSupreme Court in Nunn v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1846), illus\ntrates this view. In assessing state power to regulate\nfirearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was \u201caware\nthat it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],\nlike other amendments adopted at the same time, is a\nrestriction upon the government of the United States, and\ndoes not extend to the individual States.\u201d Id., at 250. But\nhe still considered the right to keep and bear arms as \u201can\nunalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free\ngovernment,\u201d and thus found the States bound to honor it.\nIbid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with\nrespect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu\nmerated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the\nprotections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable\nagainst the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi\nnent treatise of the era took the same position.

CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n124\u2013125 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint 2009) (arguing that certain\nof the first eight Amendments \u201cappl[y] to the state legisla\ntures\u201d because those Amendments \u201cform parts of the\ndeclared rights of the people, of which neither the state\npowers nor those of the Union can ever deprive them\u201d); id.,\nat 125\u2212126 (describing the Second Amendment \u201cright of\nthe people to keep and bear arms\u201d as \u201ca restraint on both\u201d\nCongress and the States); see also Heller, 554 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 34) (describing Rawle\u2019s treatise as \u201cinfluen\ntial\u201d). Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as\nwell. Lysander Spooner championed the popular aboli\ntionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with con\nstitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it\ndeprived black Americans of the \u201cnatural right of all men\n\u2018to keep and bear arms\u2019 for their personal defence,\u201d which\nhe believed the Constitution \u201cprohibit[ed] both Congress\nand the State governments from infringing.\u201d L. Spooner,\nThe Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).\n   In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of\nRights did apply to the States, even though this Court had\nsquarely rejected that theory. See, e.g., supra, at 27\u201328\n(recounting Rep. Hale\u2019s argument to this effect). Many\nothers believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of\nRights were ones that no State should abridge, even\nthough they understood that the Bill technically did not\napply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that\nmost state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the\nindividual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made\nthe need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties\nagainst the States an afterthought. See ante, at 29 (opin\nion of the Court) (noting that, \u201c[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\nexplicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms\u201d).\nThat changed with the national conflict over slavery.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            41\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                              b\n   In the contentious years leading up to the Civil War,\nthose who sought to retain the institution of slavery found\nthat to do so, it was necessary to eliminate more and more\nof the basic liberties of slaves, free blacks, and white\nabolitionists. Congressman Tobias Plants explained that\nslaveholders \u201ccould not hold [slaves] safely where dissent\nwas permitted,\u201d so they decided that \u201call dissent must be\nsuppressed by the strong hand of power.\u201d 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1013. The measures they used were ruthless, re\npressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitu\ntion, and demonstrated that preventing only discrimina\ntory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow\nassurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the\nAmerican people understood this point.\n   The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress\nthe spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant\nrisk of a slave rebellion. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate\nthe extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slave\nholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures.\nSlaves and free blacks represented a substantial percent\nage of the population and posed a severe threat to South\nern order if they were not kept in their place. According to\nthe 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more\nof the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half\nthe population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisi\nana, and more than 50% of the population in Mississippi\nand South Carolina. Statistics of the United States (In\ncluding Mortality, Property, &c.,) in 1860, The Eighth\nCensus 336\u2212350 (1866).\n   The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded.\nAlthough there were others, two particularly notable slave\nuprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In\n1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark\nVesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their\nmasters and flee to Haiti. H. Aptheker, American Negro\n42                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nSlave Revolts 268\u2013270 (1983). The plan was foiled, lead\ning to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of\n37, including Vesey. Id., at 271. Still, slaveowners took\nnotice\u2014it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to\n9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. Id.,\nat 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was real\nized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at\nleast 57 whites before it was suppressed. Id., at 300\u2013302.\n  The fear generated by these and other rebellions led\nSouthern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at\nthe rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and\nbear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even\nthe Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in\nsome States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution:\nSlavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956). Vir\nginia made it a crime for a member of an \u201cabolition\u201d soci\nety to enter the State and argue \u201cthat the owners of slaves\nhave no property in the same, or advocate or advise the\nabolition of slavery.\u201d 1835\u20131836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44.\nOther States prohibited the circulation of literature deny\ning a master\u2019s right to property in his slaves and passed\nlaws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search\nof such material. C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought\nStruggle in the Old South 118\u2013143, 199\u2013200 (1964).\n  Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting\nslaves from carrying firearms18 to apply the prohibition to\nfree blacks as well. See, e.g., Act of Dec. 23, 1833, \u00a77, 1833\nGa. Acts pp. 226, 228 (declaring that \u201cit shall not be lawful\nfor any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or\ncarry fire arms of any description whatever\u201d); H.

L.\nJ. 309, 340 (1991) (hereinafter Cottrol) (recounting a July\n1834 mob attack against \u201cchurches, homes, and businesses\nof white abolitionists and blacks\u201d in New York that in\nvolved \u201cupwards of twenty thousand people and required\nthe intervention of the militia to suppress\u201d); ibid.

As Representative\nThaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, \u201c[w]hen it was\nfirst proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did\nnot half the nation tremble? The prim conservatives, the\nsnobs, and the male waiting-maids in Congress, were in\n44                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nhysterics.\u201d K. Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865\u2013\n1877, p. 104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).\n   As the Court explains, this fear led to \u201csystematic ef\nforts\u201d in the \u201cold Confederacy\u201d to disarm the more than\n180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as\nwell as other free blacks. See ante, at 23. Some States\nformally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. Ante,\nat 23\u201324 (quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, \u00a71, reprinted in\n1 Fleming 289). Others enacted legislation prohibiting\nblacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restric\ntion not imposed on whites. See, e.g., La. Statute of 1865,\nreprinted in id., at 280. Additionally, \u201c[t]hroughout the\nSouth, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate\nsoldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms\nfrom newly freed slaves.\u201d Ante, at 24.\n   As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth\nAmendment \u201chad outlawed only those laws that discrimi\nnate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude,\nAfrican-Americans in the South would likely have re\nmained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abus\ners: the state militia and state peace officers.\u201d Ante, at 32.\nIn the years following the Civil War, a law banning fire\narm possession outright \u201cwould have been nondiscrimina\ntory only in the formal sense,\u201d for it would have \u201cleft fire\narms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the\ntime the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The pub\nlicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see ante, at\n23\u201324 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens\nindicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a\nfederal solution to this problem, see, e.g., 39th Cong. Globe\n337 (remarks of Rep. Sumner) (introducing \u201ca memorial\nfrom the colored citizens of the State of South Carolina\u201d\nasking for, inter alia, \u201cconstitutional protection in keeping\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

McPherson, The\nPolitical History of the United States of America During\nthe Period of Reconstruction 37 (1871) (\u201cThe constitutional\nrights of all loyal and well-disposed inhabitants to bear\narms will not be infringed\u201d). The significance of these\nsteps was not lost on those they were designed to protect.\nAfter one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder,\npublished by the African Methodist Episcopal Church,\npublished the following editorial:\n       \u201c \u2018We have several times alluded to the fact that the\n    Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every\n    citizen the right to keep and bear arms. . . .

The\nproblem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under\nDred Scott, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and\nthat, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state\nlaw recognized did not apply to blacks.

Absent a constitutional amendment to\nenforce that right against the States, he insisted that \u201cthe\nwork of the Abolitionists [wa]s not finished.\u201d Ibid.\n   This history confirms what the text of the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause most naturally suggests: Consistent\nwith its command that \u201c[n]o State shall . . . abridge\u201d the\nrights of United States citizens, the Clause establishes a\nminimum baseline of federal rights, and the constitutional\nright to keep and bear arms plainly was among them.19\n                           III\n  My conclusion is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents,\nwhich hold that the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms is not a privilege of United States citizenship.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 Iconclude that the right to keep and bear arms applies to the\nStates through the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which recognizes\nthe rights of United States \u201ccitizens.\u201d The plurality concludes that the\nright applies to the States through the Due Process Clause, which\ncovers all \u201cperson[s].\u201d Because this case does not involve a claim\nbrought by a noncitizen, I express no view on the difference, if any,\nbetween my conclusion and the plurality\u2019s with respect to the extent to\nwhich the States may regulate firearm possession by noncitizens.\n48                     MCDONALD v.

I must,\ntherefore, consider whether stare decisis requires reten\ntion of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my\ninquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not\nendeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent,\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other\nrights enumerated in the Constitution against the\nStates.20 Nor do I suggest that the stare decisis considera\ntions surrounding the application of the right to keep and\nbear arms against the States would be the same as those\nsurrounding another right protected by the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause. I consider stare decisis only as it\napplies to the question presented here.\n                              A\n  This inquiry begins with the Slaughter-House Cases.\nThere, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a\nmonopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of\nNew Orleans to a newly incorporated company. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Butchers excluded by the monopoly sued, claiming\nthat the statute violated the Privileges or Immunities\nClause because it interfered with their right to pursue and\n\u201cexercise their trade.\u201d Id., at 60.

Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights\nprotect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2 (granting the \u201cPrivi\nlege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d), and there is no obvious evidence\nthat the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to\nexclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent\nfederal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as\nprotecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth\nAmendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment\u2019s\nEstablishment Clause, which \u201cdoes not purport to protect individual\nrights.\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50\n(2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see Amar 179\u2013180.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court held that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of\nfederal citizenship\u2014those \u201cwhich owe their existence to\nthe Federal government, its National character, its Con\nstitution, or its laws,\u201d id., at 79\u2014and did not protect any\nof the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other\nwords, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually\nexclusive.\n   After separating these two sets of rights, the Court\ndefined the rights of state citizenship as \u201cembrac[ing]\nnearly every civil right for the establishment and protec\ntion of which organized government is instituted\u201d\u2014that is,\nall those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer\nring to \u201cthose rights\u201d that \u201cJudge Washington\u201d described).\nThat left very few rights of federal citizenship for the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court\nsuggested a handful of possibilities, such as the \u201cright of\nfree access to [federal] seaports,\u201d protection of the Federal\nGovernment while traveling \u201con the high seas,\u201d and even\ntwo rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting\n\u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and \u201cthe privilege of\nthe writ of habeas corpus\u201d); see supra, at 4. But its deci\nsion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship\nas mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to\nconclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were\nexcluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause\u2019s scope.\nSee Cruikshank, supra.\n   I reject that understanding. There was no reason to\ninterpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting\nthe Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the \u201cprivi\nleges and immunities\u201d of federal citizenship to mean ei\nther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights\nat all. 16 Wall., at 76. The record is scant that the public\nunderstood the Clause to make the Federal Government\n\u201ca perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States\u201d as\n50                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one\nthing, Corfield listed the \u201celective franchise\u201d as one of the\nprivileges and immunities of \u201ccitizens of the several\nstates,\u201d 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still\nfound it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment\u2014\nwhich protects \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States\nto vote\u201d\u2014two years after the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\npassage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were\nunderstood to protect every conceivable civil right from\nstate abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have\nbeen redundant.\n   The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable\nrights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to\nsay that the privileges and immunities of state and federal\ncitizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s ratification, States performed many more\nfunctions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely\nthat, simply by referring to \u201cprivileges or immunities,\u201d the\nFramers of \u00a71 meant to transfer every right mentioned in\nCorfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, \u201cprivi\nleges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d were understood only as syno\nnyms for \u201crights.\u201d See supra, at 9\u201311. It was their at\ntachment to a particular group that gave them content,\nand the text and history recounted here indicate that the\nrights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi\ncal to the rights of citizens \u201cin the several States.\u201d Justice\nSwayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made\nthe point clear:\n     \u201cThe citizen of a State has the same fundamental\n     rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer\n     tain others, local in their character, arising from his\n     relation to the State, and in addition, those which be\n     long to the citizen of the United States, he being in\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   51\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n     that relation also. There may thus be a double citi\n     zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It\n     is only over those which belong to the citizen of the\n     United States that the category here in question\n     throws the shield of its protection.\u201d 16 Wall., at 126\n     (emphasis added).\nBecause the privileges and immunities of American citi\nzenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nthey overlap to at least some extent with the privileges\nand immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the\nseveral States.\n  A separate question is whether the privileges and im\nmunities of American citizenship include any rights be\nsides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four\ndissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the\nunenumerated right that the butchers in that case as\nserted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111\n(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent\ning). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated\nright, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether\nthe Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court\u2019s\njudgment in Slaughter-House was correct.\n  Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer\nated rights against the States creates \u201c \u2018special hazards\u2019 \u201d\nthat should prevent this Court from returning to the\noriginal meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 To the extent JUSTICE STEVENS is concerned that reliance on the\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may invite judges to \u201cwrite their\npersonal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution,\u201d post,\nat 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), his celebration of the alterna\ntive\u2014the \u201cflexibility,\u201d \u201ctranscend[ence],\u201d and \u201cdynamism\u201d of substan\ntive due process\u2014speaks for itself, post, at 14\u201315, 20.\n52                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, which\nillustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to\nrecognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of\ntextual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to\nassume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im\nmunities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not\nexpressly list the rights it protects does not render it\nincapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu\ntion contains many provisions that require an examination\nof more than just constitutional text to determine whether\na particular act is within Congress\u2019 power or is otherwise\nprohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18 (Necessary and\nProper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying\nera understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to\nmean, interpreting it should be no more \u201chazardous\u201d than\ninterpreting these other constitutional provisions by using\nthe same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But\nthey will have the advantage of being questions the Con\nstitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are\nmore worthy of this Court\u2019s attention\u2014and far more likely\nto yield discernable answers\u2014than the substantive due\nprocess questions the Court has for years created on its\nown, with neither textual nor historical support.\n   Finding these impediments to returning to the original\nmeaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it\nprecludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the\nstare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent\nthat expressly controls the question presented here.\n                            B\n  Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik\nshank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 53\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nturning the convictions of militia members responsible for\nthe brutal Colfax Massacre. See supra, at 4\u20135. Cruik\nshank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws\nin its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities\nClause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its\noriginal meaning, and I would reject the holding on that\nbasis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant\nmention as well.\n   Cruikshank\u2019s holding that blacks could look only to state\ngovernments for protection of their right to keep and bear\narms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of\nlocal governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and\ntheir descendants through a wave of private violence\ndesigned to drive blacks from the voting booth and force\nthem into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without\nfederal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and\nbear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc\ncessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very\npeople the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.\n   Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.\nThere, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a\ntroop of black militiamen for no other reason than that\nthey had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July\nparade through their mostly black town. The white mili\ntia commander, \u201cPitchfork\u201d Ben Tillman, later described\nthis massacre with pride: \u201c[T]he leading white men of\nEdgefield\u201d had decided \u201cto seize the first opportunity that\nthe negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach\nthe negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate\ntheir superiority by killing as many of them as was justifi\nable.\u201d S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman & the Reconstruction of\nWhite Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). None of the perpetrators of\nthe Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.22\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 22 Tillman   went on to a long career as South Carolina\u2019s Governor and,\n54                      MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman\nand his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal\nenforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the\nKu Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the\nWhite Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the \u201976 Associa\ntion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by\nbreaking up Republican meetings, threatening political\nleaders, and whipping black militiamen. Era of Recon\nstruction, 199\u2013200; Curtis 156. These groups raped,\nmurdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidat\ning, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they\ndespised. A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan\nConspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28\u201346 (1995).\n   Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these\nactivities,23 Klan tactics remained a constant presence in\nthe lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882\nand 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of\nblacks in the South. Cottrol 351\u2013352. They were tortured\nand killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even\nthe slightest hint of due process. Emmit Till, for example,\nwas killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white\nwoman. S. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of\nEmmett Till 15\u201331 (1988). The fates of other targets of\nmob violence were equally depraved.

But at\nother times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob\nviolence to survive. One man recalled the night during his\nchildhood when his father stood armed at a jail until\nmorning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol, 354.

The record\nmakes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary\nto include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the\nwake of the War over slavery.

We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach\nto the Sixth Amendment\u2019s criminal jury guarantee, de\u00ad\nmanding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in\nfederal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore\u00ad\ngon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399\nU. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de\u00ad\nclined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While\nthose denials have no precedential significance, they\nconfirm the proposition that the \u201cincorporation\u201d of a provi\u00ad\nsion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment\ndoes not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely\nthe same meaning in both contexts.\n   It is true, as well, that during the 1960\u2019s the Court\ndecided a number of cases involving procedural rights in\nwhich it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans\u00ad\nplanted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395\nU. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.\nTexas, 380 U.

Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also\nid., at 52\u201353 (Powell, J., dissenting).

CHICAGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfairness, some procedures should be the same in state and\nfederal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is\nmore pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when\ncriminal justice is at issue. That principle has little rele\u00ad\nvance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set\nforth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib\u00ad\nerty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378\nU. S., at 10\u201311, it is therefore an overstatement to say\nthat the Court has \u201cabandoned,\u201d ante, at 16, 17 (majority\nopinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a \u201ctwo-track approach to\nincorporation,\u201d ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court\nmoved away from that approach in the area of criminal\nprocedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda\u00ad\nmental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill\nof Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some\n1960\u2019s opinions purported to establish a general method of\nincorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court\nhas not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court\nexcesses in more areas than I can count.\n   I do not mean to deny that there can be significant\npractical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights\nsymmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov\u00ad\nernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may\nentail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore\ngreater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora\u00ad\ntion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of\nthe legal rule. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356,\n384\u2013388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380\nU. S., at 413\u2013414 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federal\u00ad\nist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry\nsubstantial costs. When a federal court insists that state\nand local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not\ncritical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter\nmay be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent\n\u201cexperimentation in things social and economic\u201d that\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. 262, 311 (1932)\n(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts\u2019\nimposing a uniform national standard may be especially\nhigh when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi\u00ad\ncantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the\nStates\u2019 core police powers.\n  Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the\nStates, federal courts will cause those provisions to \u201cbe\nwatered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.\u201d\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 182, n. 21 (1968)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must\nprevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs\nand customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan\u00ad\ndard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when\nwe move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure\nand into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.\nSo long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are\nalways and everywhere respected, it is not clear that\ngreater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a\nprovision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is\nfar from clear that proponents of an individual right to\nkeep and bear arms ought to celebrate today\u2019s decision.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and\n\nbear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional\nRights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex.

If federal and state courts must harmonize their review of gun\u00ad\ncontrol laws under the Second Amendment, the resulting jurisprudence\nmay prove significantly more deferential to those laws than the status\nquo ante. Once it has been established that a single legal standard\nmust govern nationwide, federal courts will face a profound pressure to\nreconcile that standard with the diverse interests of the States and\n14                     MCDONALD v.

Implicit in Justice Cardozo\u2019s test is a recognition\nthat the postulates of liberty have a universal character.\nLiberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that\nprevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations\nof a certain group, or the personal preferences of their\nchampions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they\nare not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized\nas a \u201crational continuum\u201d of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral\ncommitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause\ntranscend the local and the particular.\n   Justice Cardozo\u2019s test undeniably requires judges to\napply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not\nmean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In\naddition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part\nIII, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds\nground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down\nelsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English\ncommon law, legislative and social facts, scientific and\nprofessional developments, practices of other civilized\nsocieties,15 and, above all else, the \u201c \u2018traditions and con\u00ad\nscience of our people,\u2019 \u201d Palko, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)), are\ncritical variables. They can provide evidence about which\nrights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur\nto judicial action.\n   The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in\nits suggestion that later cases rendered Palko\u2019s methodol\u00ad\nogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that\nJustice Cardozo\u2019s test will not be satisfied \u201c \u2018if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the par\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 See Palko, 302 U.

Palko does contain some language that could be\nread to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process\nrecognition, reserving it for practices without which \u201cnei\u00ad\nther liberty nor justice would exist.\u201d 302 U. S., at 326.\nBut in view of Justice Cardozo\u2019s broader analysis, as well\nas the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims\nunder the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over\u00ad\nreadings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco\u00ad\nnian manner.\n   Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan\nmark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out\nliberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to \u201cpar\u00ad\nticular procedural safeguard[s]\u201d in the Bill of Rights relat\u00ad\ning to \u201ccriminal processes,\u201d 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did\nnot purport to set a standard for other types of liberty\ninterests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,\nDuncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:\nThe judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac\u00ad\ntice \u201cis fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,\u201d within the\ncontext of the \u201cAnglo-American\u201d system. Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149\u2013150, n. 14. Several of our most important\nrecent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive\ndue process analysis\u2014from which, once again, \u201cincorpora\u00ad\ntion\u201d analysis derives\u2014must not be wholly backward\nlooking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572\n(2003) (\u201c[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but\nnot in all cases the ending point of the substantive due\nprocess inquiry\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nMichael H. v.

The Court hinges its entire\ndecision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se\u00ad\nlected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and\n19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about\nfirearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural\u00ad\nity suggests that only interests that have proved \u201cfunda\u00ad\nmental from an American perspective,\u201d ante, at 37, 44, or\n\u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the\nCourt\u2019s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the\nFourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court\u2019s opin\u00ad\nion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a\nright is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its\nstatus under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri\u00ad\nously mistaken.\n   A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most\nbasically, because our substantive due process doctrine\nhas never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even\npredominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied\nmany of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to\nthe States in the 1960\u2019s, it often asked whether the guar\u00ad\nantee in question was \u201cfundamental in the context of the\ncriminal processes maintained by the American States.\u201d17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 I acknowledge that some have read the Court\u2019s opinion in Glucks\u00ad\nberg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all\npurposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology\u2014and thereby to\ndebilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg\u2019s aspiration,\nLawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I\nhave little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.\n  17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question\n\nwas deeply rooted in founding-era practice. See Brief for Respondent\nCity of Chicago et al. 31, n. 17 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents\u2019\nBrief) (noting that only two opinions extensively discussed such his\u00ad\ntory).\n18                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDuncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex\u00ad\ntend back through time, but it was focused not so much on\nhistorical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional\nsignificance within the States\u2019 regimes. This contextual\u00ad\nized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any\ngiven trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It\nis only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes\nwith other procedures and practices in a criminal justice\nsystem that its relationship to \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d\ncan be determined.\n   Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to\nrecognize rights distinct from the trial context\u2014rights\nrelating to the primary conduct of free individuals\u2014\nJustice Cardozo\u2019s test has been our guide. The right to\nfree speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state\ninfringement not because the States have always honored\nit, but because it is \u201cessential to free government\u201d and \u201cto\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions\u201d\u2014that is,\nbecause the right to free speech is implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95,\n96 (1940); see also, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S., at 12 (discuss\u00ad\ning right to marry person of another race); Mapp v. Ohio,\n367 U.

S. 147, 161 (1939) (discussing\nright to distribute printed matter).18 While the verbal\nformula has varied, the Court has largely been consistent\nin its liberty-based approach to substantive interests\noutside of the adjudicatory system.

For if it were\nreally the case that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guaran\u00ad\ntee of liberty embraces only those rights \u201cso rooted in our\nhistory, tradition, and practice as to require special protec\u00ad\ntion,\u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721, n. 17, then the guar\u00ad\nantee would serve little function, save to ratify those\nrights that state actors have already been according the\nmost extensive protection.19 Cf. Duncan, 391 U. S., at 183\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing \u201ccircular[ity]\u201d of his\u00ad\ntoricized test for incorporation). That approach is unfaith\u00ad\nful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when\nthey ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level\nof generality they chose when they crafted its language; it\npromises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the\nvalue judgments that pervade any analysis of what cus\u00ad\ntoms, defined in what manner, are sufficiently \u201c \u2018rooted\u2019 \u201d;\nit countenances the most revolting injustices in the name\nof continuity,20 for we must never forget that not only\nslavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank\nforms of discrimination are part of our history; and it\neffaces this Court\u2019s distinctive role in saying what the law\nis, leaving the development and safekeeping of liberty to\nmajoritarian political processes. It is judicial abdication in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 I do not mean to denigrate this function, or to imply that only \u201cnew\n\nrights\u201d\u2014whatever one takes that term to mean\u2014ought to \u201cget in\u201d the\nsubstantive due process door.

In considering\nsuch a majestic term as \u201cliberty\u201d and applying it to present\ncircumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call\nand its open texture\u2014and to the grant of interpretive\ndiscretion the latter embodies\u2014without injecting excessive\nsubjectivity or unduly restricting the States\u2019 \u201cbroad lati\u00ad\ntude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems\nof vital local concern,\u201d Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597\n(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that\nwe must ground the analysis in historical experience and\nreasoned judgment, and never on \u201cmerely personal and\nprivate notions.\u201d Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170\n(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional\nconstraints on the decisional process. Although \u201cguide\u00ad\nposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\narea are scarce and open-ended,\u201d Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U.

Where we part\nways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical\nconsiderations.\n  There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concern that\n\u201ccourts have the last word\u201d on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,\non the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution\u2019s Article V amend\u00ad\nment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of\ncourse reverse this Court\u2019s rulings through that same process.\n  23 In assessing concerns about the \u201copen-ended[ness]\u201d of this area of\n\nlaw, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle\u00ad\nability not only of the Court\u2019s \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d/fundamentality standard\nbut also of substantive due process\u2019 constitutional cousin, \u201cequal\nprotection\u201d analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of\nentailing an insufficiently \u201crestrained methodology.\u201d Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 721. Yet \u201cthe word \u2018liberty\u2019 in the Due Process Clause seems to\nprovide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word \u2018equal\u2019\nin the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d Post, The Supreme Court 2002\nTerm\u2014Foreword: Fashioning the Legal Constitution: Culture, Courts,\nand Law, 117 Harv.

The Framers did not express a clear understand\u00ad\ning of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated\nLochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial\noverconfidence in using substantive due process to ad\u00ad\nvance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,\nLochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most\ndurable precedents, the Court \u201chas not attempted to define\nwith exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed\u201d by the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,\ne.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499.

Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).\nThese categories are not exclusive. Government action\nthat shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled\nexpectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or\nlife choices without adequate justification, perpetrates\ngross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always\nbe vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact\nthat an asserted right falls within one of these categories\nend the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive\nmore robust judicial protection, but the strength of the\nindividual\u2019s liberty interests and the State\u2019s regulatory\ninterests must always be assessed and compared. No\nright is absolute.\n   Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the\nliberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a\nconceptual core.

S. 609, 619 (1984), \u201cthe\nindividual\u2019s right to make certain unusually important\ndecisions that will affect his own, or his family\u2019s, destiny,\u201d\nFitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected\nas a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,\nfreedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political\nequality, dignity and respect\u2014these are the central values\nwe have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\n   Another key constraint on substantive due process\nanalysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu\u00ad\nlar liberty interest is already being given careful consid\u00ad\neration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the\nStates, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.\nWhen the Court declined to establish a general right to\n24                MCDONALD v.

Glucks\u00ad\nberg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long\nappreciated that more \u201csearching\u201d judicial review may be\njustified when the rights of \u201cdiscrete and insular minori\u00ad\nties\u201d\u2014groups that may face systematic barriers in the\npolitical system\u2014are at stake. United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have\na \u201ccomparative . . . advantage\u201d over the elected branches\non a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,\nat 8.\n   Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It\ntakes that right, to a considerable extent, \u201coutside the\narena of public debate and legislative action.\u201d Glucksberg,\n521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must\nbe taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig\u00ad\nnity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and\ndemand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to\nthe interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and\nthe practical realities of contemporary society provides an\nimportant tool for guiding judicial discretion.\n   This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the\nneed to approach our work with humility and caution.\nBecause the relevant constitutional language is so \u201cspa\u00ad\ncious,\u201d Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that\n\u201c[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to\nexercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break\nnew ground in this field.\u201d Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many\nof my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same\npoint, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502\u2013\n503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542\u2013545\n(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n46, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical\nstudy may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But\nthe inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section\n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in\nevery case, and \u201c[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,\nin this area, for judgment and restraint.\u201d Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such\nrestraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth\u00ad\ners, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de\u00ad\ncisis\u2014adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter\u00ad\nests, prizing stability and order in the law\u2014and the\ncommon-law method\u2014taking cases and controversies as\nthey present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen\u00ad\ntally, building on what came before. This restrained\nmethodology was evident even in the heyday of \u201cincorpora\u00ad\ntion\u201d during the 1960\u2019s. Although it would have been\nmuch easier for the Court simply to declare certain\nAmendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States\nin toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into\nits component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.\nThis piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize\nmore closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc\u00ad\ning both the risk and the cost of error.\n   Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an\nabstract plane, the Court has \u201crequired in substantive\u00ad\ndue-process cases a \u2018careful description\u2019 of the asserted\nfundamental liberty interest.\u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at\n721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);\nCollins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of\nHealth, 497 U. S. 261, 277\u2013278 (1990)). And just as we\nhave required such careful description from the litigants,\nwe have required of ourselves that we \u201cfocus on the allega\u00ad\ntions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de\u00ad\nscribes the constitutional right at stake.\u201d Collins, 503\nU. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San\n26                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDiego L. Rev. 437, 446\u2013448 (1985). This does not mean\nthat we must define the asserted right at the most specific\nlevel, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a\nmoral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,\nthat we must pay close attention to the precise liberty\ninterest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.\n   Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the\nmost expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for\nsubstantive due process recognition, particular compo\u00ad\nnents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a\ncategorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam\u00ad\nple, does not \u201c \u2018foreclose the possibility that an individual\nplaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose\nassistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular\u00ad\nized challenge.\u2019 \u201d Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24\n(quoting id., at 750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nments)); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 809, n. 13\n(1997) (leaving open \u201c \u2018the possibility that some applica\u00ad\ntions of the [New York prohibition on assisted suicide]\nmay impose an intolerable intrusion on the patient\u2019s free\u00ad\ndom\u2019 \u201d). Even if a State\u2019s interest in regulating a certain\nmatter must be permitted, in the general course, to trump\nthe individual\u2019s countervailing liberty interest, there may\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 The notion that we should define liberty claims at the most specific\nlevel available is one of JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s signal contributions to the\ntheory of substantive due process. See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D.,\n491 U. S. 110, 127\u2013128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of SCALIA, J.); ante, at 7\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.).

L.\n983, 1002, n. 73 (2006): When one defines the liberty interest at issue in\nLawrence as the freedom to perform specific sex acts, ante, at 2, the\ninterest starts to look less compelling. The Court today does not follow\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s \u201cparticularizing\u201d method, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384\nU. S. 641, 649 (1966), as it relies on general historical references to\nkeeping and bearing arms, without any close study of the States\u2019\npractice of regulating especially dangerous weapons.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 742\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments).\n   As this discussion reflects, to acknowledge that the task\nof construing the liberty clause requires judgment is not to\nsay that it is a license for unbridled judicial lawmaking.\nTo the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discre\u00ad\ntion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful\naccountability.\n                             IV\n   The question in this case, then, is not whether the Sec\u00ad\nond Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever\nthat right\u2019s precise contours) applies to the States because\nthe Amendment has been incorporated into the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment. It has not been. The question,\nrather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti\u00ad\ntioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth\nAmendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to\nanswer that question, we need to determine, first, the\nnature of the right that has been asserted and, second,\nwhether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment\n\u201cliberty.\u201d Even accepting the Court\u2019s holding in Heller, it\nremains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear\narms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable\nagainst the States, or that only part of the right is so\nenforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 22),\n\nthe Court concluded, over my dissent, that the Second Amendment\nconfers \u201can individual right to keep and bear arms\u201d disconnected from\nmilitia service. If that conclusion were wrong, then petitioners\u2019 \u201cincor\u00ad\nporation\u201d claim clearly would fail, as they would hold no right against\nthe Federal Government to be free from regulations such as the ones\nthey challenge. Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of\ntheir amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been\ndecided\u2014indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist\u2014we\nwould still have an obligation to address petitioners\u2019 Fourteenth\n28                   MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nin this case that some part of the Heller right applies to\nthe States, and then to find in later cases that other parts\nof the right also apply, or apply on different terms.\n   As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners\nhave asserted is the \u201cright to possess a functional, per\u00ad\nsonal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.\u201d\nComplaint \u00b634, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows resi\u00ad\ndents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are\nregistered, but it generally prohibits the possession of\nhandguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short\u00ad\nbarreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a78\u201320\u2013\n050 (2009).27 Petitioners\u2019 complaint centered on their\ndesire to keep a handgun at their domicile\u2014it references\nthe \u201chome\u201d in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint \u00b6\u00b63\u2013\n4, 11\u201330, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19\u201326\u2014as did\ntheir supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,\n49\u201352, 54\u201356. Petitioners now frame the question that\nconfronts us as \u201c[w]hether the Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities\nor Due Process Clauses.\u201d Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it\nis our duty \u201cto focus on the allegations in the complaint to\ndetermine how petitioner describes the constitutional\nright at stake,\u201d Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the\ngravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a\nhandgun or other firearm of one\u2019s choosing in the home.\n   Petitioners\u2019 framing of their complaint tracks the\nCourt\u2019s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained\nsome dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAmendment claim.\n   27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that\n\nmay raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)\n(quoting Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u20131 (2007), 27\u20131\u20131\n(2009)). The Court, however, declined to grant certiorari on the Na\u00ad\ntional Rifle Association\u2019s challenge to the Oak Park restrictions.\nChicago is the only defendant in this case.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). But the\nHeller plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an oper\u00ad\nable firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see id., at\n___ (slip op., at 2, and n. 2), and the Court\u2019s opinion was\nbookended by reminders that its holding was limited to\nthat one issue, id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord,\nante, at 44 (plurality opinion). The distinction between\nthe liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the\nSecond Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore\nevanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even\nif both rights have the logical potential to extend further,\nupon \u201cfuture evaluation,\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem\u00ad\nplating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro\u00ad\nceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.\n   Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of\nfirearm in the home, petitioners\u2019 argument has real\nforce.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the\nhouse is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib\u00ad\nerty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to\ndecisions about the education and upbringing of one\u2019s\nchildren. For it is the kind of decision that may have\nprofound consequences for every member of the family,\nand for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep\na handgun, heads of households must ask themselves\nwhether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of\ndeliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or\nserious injury, not only to residents of the home but to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago\u2019s registra\u00ad\n\ntion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate\nthe Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make\nno effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or\nthat they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have\nasserted.\n30                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nothers as well. Millions of Americans have answered this\nquestion in the affirmative, not infrequently because they\nbelieve they have an inalienable right to do so\u2014because\nthey consider it an aspect of \u201cthe supreme human dignity\nof being master of one\u2019s fate rather than a ward of the\nState,\u201d Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been\nbased, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs\nthat are an aspect of individual autonomy the government\nmay not control.29\n  Bolstering petitioners\u2019 claim, our law has long recog\u00ad\nnized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary\nin modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law\u00ad\nrence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445\nU. S. 573, 585\u2013590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.\n557, 565\u2013568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\nConsequently, we have long accorded special deference to\nthe privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a\nmagnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark\u00ad\nens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog\u00ad\nnized a \u201cright of habitation,\u201d 4 Commentaries *223, and\nopined that \u201cevery man\u2019s house is looked upon by the law\nto be his castle of defence and asylum,\u201d 3 id., at *288.\nHeller carried forward this legacy, observing that \u201cthe\nneed for defense of self, family, and property is most\nacute\u201d in one\u2019s abode, and celebrating \u201cthe right of law\u00ad\nabiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of\nhearth and home.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,\n63).\n  While the individual\u2019s interest in firearm possession is\nthus heightened in the home, the State\u2019s corresponding\ninterest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 Members of my generation, at least, will recall the many passionate\n\nstatements of this view made by the distinguished actor, Charlton\nHeston.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ngenerally has a lesser basis for regulating private as com\u00ad\npared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home\ngenerally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as com\u00ad\npared to firearms taken outside. The historical case for\nregulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many\nStates have for many years imposed stricter, and less\ncontroversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on\ntheir domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at\n54) (noting that \u201cthe majority of the 19th-century courts to\nconsider the question held that prohibitions on carrying\nconcealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend\u00ad\nment or state analogues\u201d); English v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n478\u2013479 (1871) (observing that \u201calmost, if not every one of\nthe States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carry\u00ad\ning of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,\u201d and\nlambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as\n\u201clittle short of ridiculous\u201d); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defend\u00ad\ning the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.\nL. Rev. 1278, 1321\u20131336 (2009).\n   It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal\nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home\nwould be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to\nadminister. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal\nuncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of\nimposing a national rule on the States in this area for the\nfirst time in United States history, the Court could at least\nmoderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the\nStates by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  30 See  Municipal Respondents\u2019 Brief 20, n. 11 (stating that at least\n156 Second Amendment challenges were brought in time between\nHeller\u2019s issuance and brief\u2019s filing); Brady Center Brief 3 (stating that\nover 190 Second Amendment challenges were brought in first 18\nmonths since Heller); Brief for Villages of Winnetka and Skokie, Illi\u00ad\nnois, et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (stating that, in wake of Heller, munici\u00ad\npalities have \u201crepealed longstanding handgun laws to avoid costly\nlitigation\u201d).\n32                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbounded in scope.\n  In their briefs to this Court, several amici have sought\nto bolster petitioners\u2019 claim still further by invoking a\nright to individual self-defense.31 As petitioners note, the\nHeller majority discussed this subject extensively and\nremarked that \u201c[t]he inherent right of self-defense has\nbeen central to the Second Amendment right.\u201d 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were\nto try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of\ndefending themselves from imminent physical threats, or\nto deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re\u00ad\nsponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi\u00ad\ncant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process right to be spared such untenable\ndilemmas is a serious one.32\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 See, e.g., Brief for Professors of Philosophy, Criminology, Law, and\nOther Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement\nEducators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29\u201345; Brief\nfor 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12\u201331.\n  32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,\n\nhowever, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self\u00ad\ndefense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi\u00ad\nnal Law Defenses \u00a7132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly\nan interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And\nthe States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this\ninterest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and\namounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of\naggressors, the availability of the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d and so forth. See\nBrief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus\nCuriae 9\u201321; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201319; 2\nW. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a710.4, pp. 142\u2013160 (2d ed. 2003).\nSuch variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist\nsystem, as the States and localities select different rules in light of\ndifferent priorities, customs, and conditions.\n  As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of\nself-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We\nhave generally understood Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty\u201d as some\u00ad\nthing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal\nright of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Petitioners have not\nasked that we establish a constitutional right to individual\nself-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court\nnor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor\ndo petitioners contend that the city of Chicago\u2014which,\nrecall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot\u00ad\nguns, and to keep them loaded\u2014has unduly burdened any\nsuch right. What petitioners have asked is that we \u201cincor\u00ad\nporate\u201d the Second Amendment and thereby establish a\nconstitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,\nto keep a handgun in the home.\n  Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic\u00ad\ning self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of\naction is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and\nutilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that\naction. And while some might favor handguns, it is not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ngovernment tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere\nwith (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces\u00ad\nsary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy\nthat, in entering civil society and gaining \u201cthe advantages of mutual\ncommerce\u201d and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,\nto a significant degree, \u201cthat wild and savage liberty\u201d one possessed in\nthe state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7128, pp. 63\u201364 (J.\nGough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power \u201cto do whatever he\nthinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,\u201d but this \u201che gives\nup when he joins in a . . . particular political society\u201d); Green v.

See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early\nAmerican Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici\nCuriae 6\u201313 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because\nthere may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self\u00ad\ndefense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric\u00ad\ntions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional\nright to the same.\n34                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self\u00ad\ndefense, and nothing in petitioners\u2019 argument turns on\nthat being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense\nimplies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm\npresupposes not only controversial judgments about the\nstrength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but\nalso controversial assumptions about the likely effects\nof making that type of firearm more broadly available. It\nis a very long way from the proposition that the Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of\nself-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban\nhandguns.33\n  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in\nparticular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly\nrelevant to an assessment of petitioners\u2019 asserted right,\nthere is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.\nThe question we must decide is whether the interest in\nkeeping in the home a firearm of one\u2019s choosing\u2014a hand\u00ad\ngun, for petitioners\u2014is one that is \u201ccomprised within the\nterm liberty\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment.

In my view, the Court badly\nmisconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of\npersonal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state\nmilitias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with\ntyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,\nnot with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear\nthat self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and\nsubstance of the Amendment\u2019s guarantee. The Court struck down the\nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand\u00ad\nguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for\nthat purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201358). And the Court\u2019s\ncommon-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the\nright, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54\u201355), had little to do with self-defense.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot accept petitioners\u2019\nbroader submission. A number of factors, taken together,\nlead me to this conclusion.\n   First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela\u00ad\ntionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners\ndefend their families and property from intruders, they\ncan help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent\nvictims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far\nfrom hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of\nour communities. Amici calculate that approximately one\nmillion Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire\nin the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer\ndisproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand\u00ad\nguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some\nhomeowners may prefer handguns because of their small\nsize, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals\nwill value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32\u201333).\nIn recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more\nthan four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34 Brady  Center Brief 11 (extrapolating from Government statistics);\nsee also Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 6\u20137 (reporting estimated social cost of firearm-related violence\nof $100 billion per year).\n36                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nall murders nationwide.35\n   Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from\nparticular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides\nof the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as\nwell as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique\npotential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to\ndestabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and\nbearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in\nbeing and feeling safe from armed violence. And while\ngranting you the right to own a handgun might make you\nsafer on any given day\u2014assuming the handgun\u2019s marginal\ncontribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri\u00ad\nbution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis\u00ad\nchief\u2014it may make you and the community you live in\nless safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand\u00ad\nguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ\u00ad\nratically elected legislature to take such concerns into\naccount in considering what sorts of regulations would\nbest serve the public welfare.\n   The practical impact of various gun-control measures\nmay be highly controversial, but this basic insight should\nnot be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive\nthreat to the social order\u2014and that reasonable restric\u00ad\ntions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur\u00ad\nden on one\u2019s personal liberty\u2014is as old as the Republic.\nAs THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a\nfoundational premise of modern government that the\nState holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: \u201cA basic\nstep in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword\nout of private hands and turn it over to an organized\ngovernment, acting on behalf of all the people.\u201d Robertson\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   35 Bogus, Gun Control and America\u2019s Cities: Public Policy and Poli\u00ad\n\ntics, 1 Albany Govt.

The same holds true for the hand\u00ad\ngun. The power a man has in the state of nature \u201cof doing\nwhatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself\nand the rest of mankind, he gives up,\u201d to a significant\nextent, \u201cto be regulated by laws made by the society.\u201d\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7129, p. 64\n(J. Gough ed. 1947).\n   Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and\nbear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does\nnot dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has\nlong afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,\nwe have never understood that principle to \u201cinfring[e]\nupon\u201d the authority of the States to proscribe certain\ninherently dangerous items, for \u201c[i]n such cases, compel\u00ad\nling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi\u00ad\nvidual to possess those materials.\u201d Stanley, 394 U. S., at\n568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home\nmay not stay in the home. Even if the government has a\nweaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire\u00ad\narms as compared to public carriage\u2014and even if a blan\u00ad\nket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might\ntherefore be unconstitutional\u2014the line between the two is\na porous one. A state or local legislature may determine\nthat a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon\nis necessary to police that line.\n   Second, the right to possess a firearm of one\u2019s choosing\nis different in kind from the liberty interests we have\nrecognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the\nplethora of substantive due process cases that have been\ndecided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none\nthat holds, states, or even suggests that the term \u201cliberty\u201d\nencompasses either the common-law right of self-defense\nor a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a\nmoment that many Americans feel deeply passionate\nabout firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life\n38                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not\nappear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or\nany particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of\nautonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace\noffers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper\u00ad\nfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici\nmake such a contention. Petitioners\u2019 claim is not the kind\nof substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,\njudicially enforced national standard is presumptively\nappropriate.36\n   Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue\nmay be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish\nto acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain\nfirearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the\npossession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as\nproperty interests subject to definition and regulation by\nthe States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.\nFlorida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 1) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\u201cGener\u00ad\nally speaking, state law defines property interests\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  36 JUSTICE SCALIA worries that there is no \u201cobjective\u201d way to decide\nwhat is essential to a \u201cliberty-filled\u201d existence: Better, then, to ignore\nsuch messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people\u2019s\nlives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the\nterm \u201cliberty,\u201d however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.\nSubstantive due process analysis does not require any \u201cpolitical\u201d\njudgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma\u00ad\ntive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of \u201cliberty,\u201d in the present day, is to provide\nreasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE\nSCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to \u201cthe\nright to keep and bear arms,\u201d without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is\nwhat the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government\ninfringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment liberty interest asserted by petitioners\u2014the interest in keeping a\nfirearm of one\u2019s choosing in the home\u2014is not necessarily coextensive\nwith the Second Amendment right.\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      39\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nUnder that tradition, Chicago\u2019s ordinance is unexcep\u00ad\ntional.37\n   The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dis\u00ad\nsimilar from those we have recognized in its capacity to\nundermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the\nBill of Rights\u2019 procedural guarantees may place \u201crestric\u00ad\ntions on law enforcement\u201d that have \u201ccontroversial public\nsafety implications.\u201d Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see\nalso ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica\u00ad\ntions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant\u2019s invo\u00ad\ncation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,\nor to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any\nthreat. The defendant\u2019s liberty interest is constrained by\n(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.\nThe link between handgun ownership and public safety is\nmuch tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the\nhandgun\u2019s bullets are the violence.\n   Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound\noffense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the\npractices of another religion, or a gay couple\u2019s choice to\nhave intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho\u00ad\nlogical, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers\n\nto \u201cproperty\u201d as well as \u201cliberty.\u201d Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9\u201310, n. 6 (opinion\nof SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)\n(plurality opinion), I alone viewed \u201cthe critical question\u201d as \u201cwhether\nEast Cleveland\u2019s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on\nappellant\u2019s right to use her own property as she sees fit,\u201d id., at 513\n(opinion concurring in judgment). In that case, unlike in this case, the\nasserted property right was coextensive with a right to organize one\u2019s\nfamily life, and I could find \u201cno precedent\u201d for the ordinance at issue,\nwhich \u201cexclude[d] any of an owner\u2019s relatives from the group of persons\nwho may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.\u201d Id., at 520. I am\nopen to property claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. This case\njust involves a weak one. And ever since the Court \u201cincorporated\u201d the\nmore specific property protections of the Takings Clause in 1897, see\nChicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S. 226, substantive due process doctrine\nhas focused on liberty.\n40                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety\nof any other person.38 Firearms may be used to kill an\u00ad\nother person. If a legislature\u2019s response to dangerous\nweapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi\u00ad\nviduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so\non the basis of more than the majority\u2019s \u201c \u2018own moral\ncode,\u2019 \u201d Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505\nU. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be\nmisguided, gun control is an area in which it \u201cis quite\nwrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy\nmutually exclusive zones\u2014that as one expands, the other\nmust contract.\u201d Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.\n   Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,\nincluding those that share our British heritage, undercuts\nthe notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms\nis intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries\nplace restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of\nfirearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in\nthis Nation. See Municipal Respondents\u2019 Brief 21\u201323\n(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,\nDenmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That\nthe United States is an international outlier in the per\u00ad\nmissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that\nour laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court\nmay not need to assume responsibility for making our\nlaws still more permissive.\n   Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in\nmany relevant respects, including their problems with\nviolent crime and the traditional role that firearms have\nplayed in their societies. But they are not so different\nfrom the United States that we ought to dismiss their\nexperience entirely. Cf. ante, at 34\u201335 (plurality opinion);\nante, at 10\u201311 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).

While the \u201cAmeri\u00ad\ncan perspective\u201d must always be our focus, ante, at 37, 44\n(plurality opinion), it is silly\u2014indeed, arrogant\u2014to think\nwe have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of\npeople beyond our borders.\n   Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the\nAmendments that surround it, with the consequence that\nits inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful\nbut positively harmful to petitioners\u2019 claim. Generally, the\ninclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points\ntoward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance\nand ought to be enforceable against the States. But the\nSecond Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as\nannounced by its peculiar opening clause.39 Even accept\u00ad\ning the Heller Court\u2019s view that the Amendment protects\nan individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected\nfrom militia service, it remains undeniable that \u201cthe pur\u00ad\npose for which the right was codified\u201d was \u201cto prevent\nelimination of the militia.\u201d Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 26); see also United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174,\n178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted \u201c[w]ith obvi\u00ad\nous purpose to assure the continuation and render possible\nthe effectiveness of [militia] forces\u201d). It was the States, not\nprivate persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second\nAmendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the Heller\nCourt\u2019s efforts to write the Second Amendment\u2019s preamble\nout of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the\nstructural function of protecting the States from en\u00ad\ncroachment by an overreaching Federal Government.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 The Second Amendment provides: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being\n\nnecessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n42                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Second Amendment, in other words, \u201cis a federal\u00ad\nism provision,\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,\n542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the\nsovereign States, and its logic therefore \u201cresists\u201d incorpo\u00ad\nration by a federal court against the States. Ibid. No one\nsuggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that\npowers not given to the Federal Government remain with\n\u201cthe States,\u201d applies to the States; such a reading would\nborder on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment\nexists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state\ngovernance. The Second Amendment is no different.40\n   The Court is surely correct that Americans\u2019 conceptions\nof the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a\nmore individualistic direction; that Members of the Recon\u00ad\nstruction Congress were urgently concerned about the\nsafety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members\nbelieved that, following ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the\nStates. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the\nconclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cincorporated\u201d\nthe Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or\npostenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that\nthe text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about\nthe Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substan\u00ad\ntial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction\nCongress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   40 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s suggestion, this point is perfectly\n\ncompatible with my opinion for the Court in Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1 (2004). Cf. ante, at 11. Like the Court\nitself, I have never agreed with JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 view that the Estab\u00ad\nlishment Clause is a federalism provision. But I agree with his under\u00ad\nlying logic: If a clause in the Bill of Rights exists to safeguard federal\u00ad\nism interests, then it makes little sense to \u201cincorporate\u201d it. JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s further suggestion that I ought to have revisited the Estab\u00ad\nlishment Clause debate in this opinion, ibid., is simply bizarre.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

The Court\u2019s\nnarrative largely elides these facts. The complications\nthey raise show why even the most dogged historical\ninquiry into the \u201cfundamentality\u201d of the Second Amend\u00ad\nment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial\njudgment\u2014and therefore judicial discretion\u2014every step of\nthe way.\n  I accept that the evolution in Americans\u2019 understanding\nof the Second Amendment may help shed light on the\nquestion whether a right to keep and bear arms is com\u00ad\nprised within Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty.\u201d But the\nreasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability\nof militiamen to keep muskets available for military use\nwhen our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the\nReconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the\nfreedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited\nbearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a\ncrime-infested metropolis today.

The plurality insists that\nthe Reconstruction-era evidence shows the right to bear arms was\nregarded as \u201ca substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.\u201d\nAnte, at 33. That may be so, but it does not resolve the question\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause was origi\u00ad\nnally understood to encompass a right to keep and bear arms, or\nwhether it ought to be so construed now.\n44                 MCDONALD v.

The idea that States may\nplace substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear\narms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more\nentrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution\nprotects any such right.

But the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the\nmatter before us\u2014as evidenced by the groundbreaking\nnature of today\u2019s fractured decision\u2014and this Court lacks\nboth the technical capacity and the localized expertise to\nassess \u201cthe wisdom, need, and propriety\u201d of most gun\u00ad\ncontrol measures.

Quite to the con\u00ad\ntrary, today\u2019s decision invites an avalanche of litigation\nthat could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determi\u00ad\nnations about which state and local regulations comport\nwith the Heller right\u2014the precise contours of which are\nfar from pellucid\u2014under a standard of review we have not\neven established.

For it is also an admission of just how many\ndifferent types of regulations are potentially implicated by\ntoday\u2019s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court\u2019s initial\nattempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.\nThe practical significance of the proposition that \u201cthe\nSecond Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,\u201d\nante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by\nthis Court over many, many years.\n  Furthermore, and critically, the Court\u2019s imposition of a\nnational standard is still more unwise because the elected\nbranches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of\nsafeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.\nThe strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con\u00ad\nnection with its status in the democratic process. And in\nthis case, no one disputes \u201cthat opponents of [gun] control\nhave considerable political power and do not seem to be at\na systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,\u201d or\nthat \u201cthe widespread commitment to an individual right to\nown guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin\u00ad\nion.

Indeed, there is a good deal of\nevidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers\ntend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views\nexpressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss,\nDisarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in\nAmerica 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has\nenacted some \u201cimprovident\u201d gun-control measures, as\npetitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent\nreason to infer that the mistake will not \u201ceventually be\nrectified by the democratic process.\u201d Vance v.

Neither petitioners nor those most zealously commit\u00ad\nted to their views represent a group or a claim that is\nliable to receive unfair treatment at the hands of the\nmajority. On the contrary, petitioners\u2019 views are sup\u00ad\nported by powerful participants in the legislative process.\nPetitioners have given us no reason to believe that the\ninterest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special\nneed for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are\nmore qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people\u2019s\nelected representatives. Having failed to show why their\nasserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered\nliberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political\narena, they have failed to show why \u201cthe word liberty in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u201d should be \u201cheld to prevent\nthe natural outcome of a dominant opinion\u201d about how to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  48 Likewise, no one contends that those interested in personal self\u00ad\ndefense\u2014every American, presumably\u2014face any particular disadvan\u00ad\ntage in the political process.

Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ncritique does not have nearly as much force as does his\nrhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,\ncomes with its own profound difficulties.\n  Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an \u201cobjective,\u201d\n\u201cneutral\u201d method of substantive due process analysis,\nante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort.

By what standard will\nthat proposition be tested? Which types of sources will\ncount, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre\u00ad\ngated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these\nquestions. There is not even a theory\u2014at least, JUSTICE\nSCALIA provides none\u2014of how to go about answering\nthem.\n  Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for\nsubstantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has\nstated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply\n52                     MCDONALD v.

Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that\ntest requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment\u2014the\nsame multifaceted evaluation of the right\u2019s contours and\nconsequences\u2014that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur\u00ad\nrence today.\n   So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel\ninsight that history is not an objective science, and that its\nuse can therefore \u201cpoint in any direction the judges favor,\u201d\nante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the\npoint was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,\nJUSTICE SCALIA remains \u201coblivious to the fact that [the\nconcept of \u2018tradition\u2019] can be as malleable and elusive as\n\u2018liberty\u2019 itself.\u201d Michael H., 491 U.

At least with the former sort\nof question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;\nthe temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela\u00ad\ntively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on\nwhat sorts of authorities merit consideration.          With\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s approach to substantive due process,\nthese guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the\nentire landscape of American law as it has evolved\nthrough time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, e.g.,\nLawrence, 539 U. S., at 596 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (dis\u00ad\ncussing \u201c \u2018ancient roots\u2019 \u201d of proscriptions against sodomy\n(quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.

Simmons, 543 U.

My point is simply that JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity\nand restraint as its cardinal\u2014and, it seems, only\u2014virtues,\nis unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number\nof subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori\u00ad\ncal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.\nAt least with my approach, the judge\u2019s cards are laid on\nthe table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must\n54                       MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                           STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nexercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti\u00ad\ntutional question to which the text provides no clear an\u00ad\nswer, there is always some amount of discretion; our\nconstitutional system has always depended on judges\u2019\nfilling in the document\u2019s vast open spaces.50 But there is\nalso transparency.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s approach is even less restrained in\nanother sense: It would effect a major break from our case\nlaw outside of the \u201cincorporation\u201d area. JUSTICE SCALIA\ndoes not seem troubled by the fact that his method is\nlargely inconsistent with the Court\u2019s canonical substantive\ndue process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,\nand Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920\u2019s, to Griswold, 381\nU. S. 479, in the 1960\u2019s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the\n2000\u2019s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso\u00ad\nnance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on\nwhich the American people have relied for decades.\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am\nleft to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation\u2019s\nconstitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to\nthe values and commitments of the American people, as\nthey stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov\u00ad\ning, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as\nequality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter\u00ad\nracial marriage was hardly \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in American\ntradition. Racial segregation and subordination were\ndeeply rooted. The Court\u2019s substantive due process hold\u00ad\ning was nonetheless correct\u2014and we should be wary of\nany interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it\nwas not.\n   Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s method invites not only bad history, but\nalso bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,\nin evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 50 Indeed,   this is truly one of our most deeply rooted legal traditions.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           55\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give\nhistory significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s position is\ncloser to my own than he apparently feels comfortable\nacknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history\ndispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially\nlittle sense to answer questions like whether the right to\nbear arms is \u201cfundamental\u201d by focusing only on the past,\ngiven that both the practical significance and the public\nunderstandings of such a right often change as society\nchanges. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at\none time firearm possession contributed substantially to\npersonal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth\u00ad\ning, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have\nbeen reasonable to constitutionalize the right?\n   The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical\nviews be less than completely clear or informative, but\nthey can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri\u00ad\ncans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not\nto be true. Some practices that many Americans believed\nto be consistent with the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of\nliberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon\u00ad\nsistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con\u00ad\nstitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal\nexistence. Although we should always \u201cpa[y] a decent\nregard to the opinions of former times,\u201d it \u201cis not the glory\nof the people of America\u201d to have \u201csuffered a blind venera\u00ad\ntion for antiquity.\u201d The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal\njudges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to\nthe Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious\nlanguage, in an effort to transform foundational legal\ncommitments into narrow rules of decision.\n   As for \u201cthe democratic process,\u201d ante, at 14, 15, a\nmethod that looks exclusively to history can easily do more\nharm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s supposedly objective analysis is to vest\n56                 MCDONALD v.

Why this \u201cintrudes much less upon\nthe democratic process,\u201d ante, at 14, than an approach\nthat would defer to the democratic process on the regula\u00ad\ntion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I\ncannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s view, con\u00ad\nstitutes an \u201cintrusion.\u201d\n   It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ\u00ad\nracy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s critique. Because\nvery few of us would welcome a system in which majorities\nor powerful interest groups always get their way. Under\nour constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a\njudicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have\noutlined\u2014an approach that investigates both the intrinsic\nnature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi\u00ad\ncance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its\nreasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con\u00ad\nstraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,\nand that is willing to protect some rights even if they have\nnot already received uniform protection from the elected\nbranches\u2014has the capacity to improve, rather than\n\u201c[im]peril,\u201d ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on\njudges\u2019 exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al\u00ad\nways has, and as it always will.\n                             VII\n  The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in\nthe Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the\nCourt\u2019s decision to enforce that right against the States.\nBy its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the\nStates; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals\noutside of the militia context. The Second Amendment\nwas adopted to protect the States from federal encroach\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been\nunderstood by the Court to have \u201cincorporated\u201d the entire\nBill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about\ntoday\u2019s outcome.\n   Although the Court\u2019s decision in this case might be seen\nas a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse\u00ad\nquences could prove far more destructive\u2014quite liter\u00ad\nally\u2014to our Nation\u2019s communities and to our constitu\u00ad\ntional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment\nright identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth\nAmendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the\nhome. But neither the \u201cassurances\u201d provided by the plu\u00ad\nrality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in\nits opinion should obscure the reality that today\u2019s ruling\nmarks a dramatic change in our law\u2014or that the Justices\nwho have joined it have brought to bear an awesome\namount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre\u00ad\nsented by this case.\n   I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set\nout at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol\u00ad\nogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al\u00ad\nthough impressively argued, the majority\u2019s decision to\noverturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent\nand to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is\nnot, in my judgment, built \u201cupon respect for the teachings\nof history, solid recognition of the basic values that under\u00ad\nlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles\nthat the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers\nhave played in establishing and preserving American\nfreedoms.\u201d Griswold, 381 U.

As he\nargues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment\nwith this objective in view. See ante, at 41\u201344 (dissenting\nopinion). Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the\ncarrying of arms for that purpose often puts others\u2019 lives\nat risk. See ante, at 35\u201337. And the use of arms for pri\nvate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional\nprotection from state regulation. See ante, at 44\u201351.\n  The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion\nupon \u201csubstantive due process\u201d concerns. Rather, it di\nrects its attention to this Court\u2019s \u201cincorporation\u201d prece\ndents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to\nprivate self-defense is \u201cfundamental\u201d so that it applies to\nthe States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,\nat 11\u201319.\n  I shall therefore separately consider the question of\n\u201cincorporation.\u201d I can find nothing in the Second Amend\nment\u2019s text, history, or underlying rationale that could\nwarrant characterizing it as \u201cfundamental\u201d insofar as it\nseeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri\n2                  MCDONALD v.

Nor can I find any justification\nfor interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate\nregulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from\ndemocratically elected legislatures to courts or from the\nStates to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment does not \u201cincorporate\u201d\nthe Second Amendment\u2019s right \u201cto keep and bear Arms.\u201d\nAnd I consequently dissent.\n                               I\n    The Second Amendment says: \u201cA well regulated Militia,\nbeing necessary to the security of a free State, the right of\nthe people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.\n___ (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial\nconsensus that the Second Amendment was primarily\nconcerned with the need to maintain a \u201cwell regulated\nMilitia.\u201d See id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20133, and n. 2, 38\u201345); United States v. Miller, 307 U. S.\n174, 178 (1939). Although the Court acknowledged that\n\u201cthe threat that the new Federal Government would de\nstroy the citizens\u2019 militia by taking away their arms was\nthe reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti\ntution,\u201d the Court asserted that \u201cindividual self defense\n. . . was the central component of the right itself.\u201d Heller,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added). The\nCourt went on to hold that the Second Amendment re\nstricted Congress\u2019 power to regulate handguns used for\nself-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the\nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s ban on the possession of handguns\nin the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).\n    The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon\nits reading of history.

That view in\nturn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having\ndescribed the right as \u201c \u2018the right of having and using arms\nfor self-preservation and defence,\u2019 \u201d which reflected the\nprovision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that\ngave the King\u2019s Protestant \u201c \u2018subjects\u2019 \u201d the right to \u201c \u2018have\nArms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as\nallowed by law.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19\u201320) (quoting 1\nW.

See Leegin\nCreative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.

At the least, where\nHeller\u2019s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex\ntend its applicability?\n   My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the\nreefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges\nwho place virtually determinative weight upon historical\nconsiderations. In my own view, the Court should not look\nto history alone but to other factors as well\u2014above all, in\ncases where the history is so unclear that the experts\nthemselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,\nconsider the basic values that underlie a constitutional\nprovision and their contemporary significance.

Under this Court\u2019s precedents, to incorporate the\nprivate self-defense right the majority must show that the\nright is, e.g., \u201cfundamental to the American scheme of\njustice,\u201d Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);\nsee ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)\n(finding that the right is \u201cfundamental\u201d and therefore\nincorporated). And this it fails to do.\n   The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost\nexclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.\nAnte, at 20\u201333. But to do so for incorporation purposes is\nboth wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points\nout, our society has historically made mistakes\u2014for ex\nample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century\nproperty rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting\nopinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,\nhistory often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,\nsupra; Part III, infra.\n   Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation\nquestion, has never stated that the historical status of a\nright is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court\nhas either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin\nions that the right in question has remained fundamental\nover time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410\n(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation\n\u201cinquiry must focus upon the function served\u201d by the right\nin question in \u201ccontemporary society\u201d (emphasis added));\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting\nthat the right in question \u201ccontinues to receive strong\nsupport\u201d); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1967) (same). And, indeed, neither of the parties before\nus in this case has asked us to employ the majority\u2019s his\ntory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67\u201369\n(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo\nrary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of\nChicago et al. 23\u201331 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)\n(looking to current state practices with respect to the\nright).\n   I thus think it proper, above all where history provides\nno clear answer, to look to other factors in considering\nwhether a right is sufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to remove it\nfrom the political process in every State. I would include\namong those factors the nature of the right; any contem\nporary disagreement about whether the right is funda\nmental; the extent to which incorporation will further\nother, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the\nextent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the\nConstitution\u2019s structural aims, including its division of\npowers among different governmental institutions (and\nthe people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,\nto further the Constitution\u2019s effort to ensure that the\ngovernment treats each individual with equal respect?\nWill it help maintain the democratic form of government\nthat the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora\ntion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu\ntion\u2019s efforts to create governmental institutions well\nsuited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?\n   Finally, I would take account of the Framers\u2019 basic\nreason for believing the Court ought to have the power of\njudicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that\npower to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,\nacting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a\npopular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey & J. McClellan\neds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (\u201cThis independence of the judges\nis equally requisite to guard the constitution and the\n8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,\nwhich\u201d can, at times, lead to \u201cserious oppressions of the\nminor part in the community\u201d). Judges, he thought, may\nfind it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the\nbasic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States\nv. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).\nThat being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu\nlar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case\nat hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).\n                               B\n   How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,\nI would apply them only to the private self-defense right\ndirectly at issue. After all, the Amendment\u2019s militia\nrelated purpose is primarily to protect States from federal\nregulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related\nregulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see\nalso Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War\nAmendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu\nmerous other institutions today help to safeguard the\nStates and the people from any serious threat of federal\ntyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?\nIt is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con\ncedes, has \u201clargely faded as a popular concern\u201d could\npossibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo\nration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.\nHence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot\nbe based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found\nto be more extensive Second Amendment rights.\n   For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self\ndefense right that the Court would incorporate has noth\ning to do with \u201cthe reason\u201d the Framers \u201ccodified\u201d the right\nto keep and bear arms \u201cin a written Constitution.\u201d 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller\nimmediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe\nless \u201cthe central component of the right.\u201d Ibid. In my\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nview, this is the historical equivalent of a claim that water\nruns uphill. See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the\nFramers\u2019 basic reasons for including language in the Con\nstitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid\ning about the contemporary importance of a right) than\nthe particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would\nhave then assigned to the words they used. And examina\ntion of the Framers\u2019 motivation tells us they did not think\nthe private armed self-defense right was of paramount\nimportance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu\ntion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (\u201c[T]o see the [Sec\nond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ\nual right to hunt, or protect one\u2019s home,\u201d would be \u201clike\nviewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as\nthe right of persons to meet to play bridge\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nRakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of\nOriginalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127\u2013128 (2000);\nBrief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu\ntional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22\u201333.\n   Further, there is no popular consensus that the private\nself-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The\nplurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case\nshow such a consensus, see ante, at 42\u201343, but, of course,\nnumerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora\ntion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms\nextensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the\nappropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement\nrests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the\nright essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the\nhome; the other side believes it essential to regulate the\nright in order to protect the lives of others attacked with\nguns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de\nvelop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of\nfirearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to\nbe, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, e.g.,\nSiegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitu\n10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntionalism in Heller, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201\u2013246 (2008).\n(Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in\nPart II\u2013B can be found in the Appendix, infra.)\n   Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incor\nporation of the private self-defense right will further any\nother or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of\nno argument that gun-control regulations target or are\npassed with the purpose of targeting \u201cdiscrete and insular\nminorities.\u201d Carolene Products Co., supra, at 153, n. 4;\nsee, e.g., ante, at 49\u201351 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Nor will\nincorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.\nUnlike the First Amendment\u2019s rights of free speech, free\npress, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense\nright does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic\nprocess that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, e.g.,\nWhitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment\u2019s religious\nprotections, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments\u2019 insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and\nthe Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection against cruel and\nunusual punishments, the private self-defense right does\nnot significantly seek to protect individuals who might\notherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the\nhands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by\nmany of these same Amendments, it does not involve\nmatters as to which judges possess a comparative exper\ntise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice\nsystem and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend\nment\u2019s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve\na matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself\nproperty belonging to a minority.\n   Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant\ndisruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak\ning authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution\u2019s\nability to further its objectives.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of\nthe right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi\ncant incursion on a traditional and important area of state\nconcern, altering the constitutional relationship between\nthe States and the Federal Government. Private gun\nregulation is the quintessential exercise of a State\u2019s \u201cpolice\npower\u201d\u2014i.e., the power to \u201cprotec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,\nhealth, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec\ntion of all property within the State,\u201d by enacting \u201call\nkinds of restraints and burdens\u201d on both \u201cpersons and\nproperty.\u201d Slaughter-House Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1873)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long\nrecognized that the Constitution grants the States special\nauthority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting\nthat States have \u201cgreat latitude\u201d to use their police powers\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade\nago, we wrote that there is \u201cno better example of the police\npower\u201d than \u201cthe suppression of violent crime.\u201d United\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam\nples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative\njudgments in respect to the exercise of the police power\nare legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,\n270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,\n521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348\nU. S. 26, 32 (1954) (\u201cWe deal, in other words, with what\ntraditionally has been known as the police power. An\nattempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is\nfruitless . . .\u201d).\n   Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular\nstate gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri\ncally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better\nable than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala\nmeda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality\nopinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520\n12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 180, 195\u2013196 (1997). And it may require this kind of\nanalysis in virtually every case.\n   Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor\nmally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help\nsave lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is\nconstitutional would thus almost always require the\nweighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against\nthe \u201cprimary concern of every government\u2014a concern for\nthe safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.\u201d United\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect\nto other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some\ntimes present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.\n444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City\nv. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403\u2013404 (2006) (Fourth Amend\nment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)\n(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But\nhere, this inquiry\u2014calling for the fine tuning of protective\nrules\u2014is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.\n   Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to\nanswer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.\nSuppose, for example, that after a gun regulation\u2019s adop\ntion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation\nwould the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this\nconclusion affected by the local recession which has left\nnumerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts\nthat led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective\nwas that police force to begin with? And did the regula\ntion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful\npurposes without affecting their possession by criminals?\n   Consider too that countless gun regulations of many\nshapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many\nlocal communities. Does the right to possess weapons for\nself-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To\nwork? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?\nHandguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngun semi-automatic? Where are different kinds of weap\nons likely needed? Does time-of-day matter? Does the\npresence of a child in the house matter? Does the pres\nence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police\nneed special rules permitting patdowns designed to find\nguns? When do registration requirements become severe\nto the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?\nWho can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior\ndrug offenders? Prior alcohol abusers? How would the\nright interact with a state or local government\u2019s ability to\ntake special measures during, say, national security emer\ngencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun\nregulation can become highly complex, and these \u201care only\na few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.\u201d Caperton\nv. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (ROB-\nERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n   The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is\nexceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms\ncause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United\nStates each year. Those who live in urban areas, police\nofficers, women, and children, all may be particularly at\nrisk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some\nexperts have calculated, for example, that Chicago\u2019s hand\ngun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to\n1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue\nthat stringent gun regulations \u201ccan help protect police\nofficers operating on the front lines against gun violence,\u201d\nhave reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and\nBaltimore, and have helped to lower New York\u2019s crime and\nhomicide rates.\n   At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt\non these studies. And who is right? Finding out may\nrequire interpreting studies that are only indirectly re\nlated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning\nhandguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci\ndents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home\n14                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthan where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at\nall? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if\nopponents of the ban put forth counter studies?\n   In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer\nto judicial homilies, such as Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century\nperception that a man\u2019s home is his castle. See 4 Black\nstone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere\nassertion, the fact that \u201cincorporation will require judges\nto assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.\u201d\nAnte, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the\ngovernment\u2019s regulatory interests without addressing\nissues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a\nregulation is appropriately tailored without considering its\nimpact? And how can the Court determine if there are\nless restrictive alternatives without considering what will\nhappen if those alternatives are implemented?\n   Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the\nmission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden\ntial approach similar to the many state courts that admin\nister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,\nat 19\u201320 (describing state approaches). But the Court has\nnot yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n57\u201364) (rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d simi\nlar to that employed by the States); ante, at 44 (plurality\nopinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few\nsimple rules, such as that it will not touch \u201cprohibitions on\nthe possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d\n\u201claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive\nplaces such as schools and government buildings,\u201d or \u201claws\nimposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial\nsale of arms.\u201d Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54\u201355);\nAnte, at 39 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and\nnot others? Does the Court know that these regulations\nare justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In\nfact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented\nrules that sound sensible without being able to explain\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhy or how Chicago\u2019s handgun ban is different.\n  The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the\nkinds of empirically based questions that will often deter\nmine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor\ndo they have readily available \u201ctools\u201d for finding and\nevaluating the technical material submitted by others.\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os\nborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also\nTurner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195\u2013196. Judges can\nnot easily make empirically based predictions; they have\nno way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if\nsuch predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation\nand concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult\nfor judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.\nNor can judges rely upon local community views and\nvalues when reaching judgments in circumstances where\nprediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or\nunknown.\n  At the same time, there is no institutional need to send\njudges off on this \u201cmission-almost-impossible.\u201d Legislators\nare able to \u201camass the stuff of actual experience and cull\nconclusions from it.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.\n63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to\nuncover facts and to understand their relevance. And\nlegislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ\nratically responsible for their empirically based and value\nladen conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our\npreference for \u201clegislative not judicial solutions\u201d to this\nkind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,\n457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly\naffirmed the Constitution\u2019s preference for democratic\nsolutions legislated by those whom the people elect.\n  In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 310\u2013\n311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:\n    \u201cSome people assert that our present plight is due, in\n16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n     part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimen\n     tation in the fields of social and economic science; and\n     to the discouragement to which proposals for better\n     ment there have been subjected otherwise. There\n     must be power in the States and the Nation to re\n     mould, through experimentation, our economic prac\n     tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco\n     nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the\n     Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified\n     it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the\n     social problems we face].\u201d\n  There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court\nmay already have refused to take this wise advice with\nrespect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters\nworse here.\n  Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences\nand conditions\u2014both key virtues of federalism\u2014here has\nparticular importance. The incidence of gun ownership\nvaries substantially as between crowded cities and uncon\ngested rural communities, as well as among the different\ngeographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately\n60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated\nWestern States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report\nthat their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of\nadults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode\nIsland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.\n  The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural\ncommunities and cities. Urban centers face significantly\ngreater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural\ncommunities have proportionately greater problems with\nnonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.\nAnd idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find\ning themselves in dramatically different circumstances:\nFor example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times\nhigher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi\nties have historically differed about the need for gun regu\nlation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris\ning that \u201cprimarily, and historically,\u201d the law has treated\nthe exercise of police powers, including gun control, as\n\u201cmatter[s] of local concern.\u201d Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes\ndecisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of\nthis particular right does so without strong offsetting\njustification\u2014as the example of Oak Park\u2019s handgun ban\nhelps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a727\u20132\u2013\n1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,\nafter a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun\nthat his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a\nblanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for\nHandgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak\nPark Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering\ninformation about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000\nsignatures from community residents in support of a ban.\nId., at 21\u201322. And the village board enacted a ban into\nlaw. Id., at 22.\n   Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board\nheld a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The\ncitizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.\nId., at 22\u201323. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak\nPark were handguns and that handguns were misused\nmore often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at\n23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the\ncontrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a\nvote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak\nPark now tells us, crime has decreased and the community\nhas seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.\n   Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the\nquestions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na\ntion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak\n18                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that\npower from the people? What is it here that the people did\nnot know? What is it that a judge knows better?\n                        *     *    *\n  In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative\ndecisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the\ncomparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,\nthe lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life\nthreatening harm that may flow from striking down regu\nlations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor\nporation of other rights has been at issue, some of these\nproblems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob\nlems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to\nbe present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in\nwhich the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.\nAt the same time, the important factors that favor incor\nporation in other instances\u2014e.g., the protection of broader\nconstitutional objectives\u2014are not present here. The up\nshot is that all factors militate against incorporation\u2014\nwith the possible exception of historical factors.\n                             III\n  I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking\nto justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the\nSecond Amendment protects are \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this\nNation\u2019s history and tradition.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 19 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks\nomitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation\u2019s\nhistory for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.\n  As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only\npertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as\nbroadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here\nare evaluating a more particular right\u2014namely, the right\nto bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\u2014general\nhistorical references to the \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nare not always helpful. Depending upon context, early\nhistorical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based\nright\u2014a matter of considerable importance 200 years\nago\u2014which has, as the majority points out, \u201clargely faded\nas a popular concern.\u201d Ante, at 22. There is no reason to\nbelieve that matters of such little contemporary impor\ntance should play a significant role in answering the\nincorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410\n(incorporation \u201cinquiry must focus upon the function\nserved\u201d by the right in question in \u201ccontemporary soci\nety\u201d); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 (1949) (incorpora\ntion must take into account \u201cthe movements of a free\nsociety\u201d and \u201cthe gradual and empiric process of inclusion\nand exclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7910 (prohibiting federal officeholders\nfrom accepting a \u201cTitle, of any kind whatever, from [a]\nforeign State\u201d\u2014presumably a matter of considerable\nimportance 200 years ago).\n   That said, I can find much in the historical record that\nshows that some Americans in some places at certain\ntimes thought it important to keep and bear arms for\nprivate self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that\nmany States have constitutional provisions protecting gun\npossession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions\ntypically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation\nwill be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,\nScrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev.\n683, 686, 716\u2013717 (2007) (the \u201ccourts of every state to\nconsider the question apply a deferential \u2018reasonable\nregulation\u2019 standard\u201d) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);\nsee also id., at 716\u2013717 (explaining the difference between\nthat standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is\nthus altogether unclear whether such provisions would\nprohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as\nthe law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The\nmajority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely\n20                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with Chicago\u2019s law; and the majority would\nalmost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201364) (striking down the District\nof Columbia\u2019s handgun ban).\n   Thus, the specific question before us is not whether\nthere are references to the right to bear arms for self\ndefense throughout this Nation\u2019s history\u2014of course there\nare\u2014or even whether the Court should incorporate a\nsimple constitutional requirement that firearms regula\ntions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear\narms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so\nsubstantial a private self-defense right as the one de\nscribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks\nberg, supra, at 721 (requiring \u201ca careful description\u201d of the\nright at issue when deciding whether it is \u201cdeeply rooted\nin this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to\nmake up his or her own mind about the historical record\nthat I describe in part below. In my view, that record is\ninsufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private\nself-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the\nsense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi\ndence below shows, States and localities have consistently\nenacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi\nlar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation\u2019s history.\nCourts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,\nat the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor\nporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a\ndifferent right to bear arms than they currently recog\nnize\u2014a right that threatens to destabilize settled state\nlegal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57\u201364)\n(rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d similar to\nthat employed by the States).\n   I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to\nwhether the right described by Heller is \u201cfundamental\u201d as\nour incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient historical support for the majority\u2019s conclusion\nthat that right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history\nand tradition.\u201d Instead, I find no more than ambiguity\nand uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians\nwould find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record\nthat is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate\nbasis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and\napplying it against the States.\nThe Eighteenth Century\n   The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th\ncentury evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u201332);\nid., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5\u201331); id.,\nat ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20137). In respect\nto the relevant question\u2014the \u201cdeeply rooted nature\u201d of a\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense\u2014that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when\naugmented as follows:\n   First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUS-\nTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in\nHeller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted\nprimarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related\nrights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5\u2013\n31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written\non the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2\u20135.\n   Second, historians now tell us that the right to which\nBlackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma\njority\u2019s historical argument, concerned the right of Par\nliament (representing the people) to form a militia to\noppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the\npeople of their traditional liberties (which did not include\nan unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century\nlanguage referring to a \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d does\nnot ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense\u2014\ncertainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians\u2019\nBrief 3\u201327; see also supra, at 2\u20135.\n22                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were\nheavily regulated at the time of the framing\u2014perhaps\nmore heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.\nFor example, one scholar writes that \u201c[h]undreds of indi\nvidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns\nin colonial and early national America.\u201d Churchill, Gun\nRegulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,\n25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat\nutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,\nas well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct\nin Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of\nMassachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, & H. Flanders,\nStatutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.\n108\u2013109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.\n748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162\u2013163 (discuss\ning bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New\nYork).\n  Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several\nStates continued to regulate firearms possession by, for\nexample, adopting rules that would have prevented the\ncarrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5\u20137) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 59\u201360). Scholars have thus concluded\nthat the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State\u2019s\npolice power to regulate guns appears to be only that\nregulations were \u201caimed at a legitimate public purpose\u201d\nand \u201cconsistent with reason.\u201d Cornell, Early American\nGun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &\nHist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).\nThe Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century\n   I would also augment the majority\u2019s account of this\nperiod as follows:\n   First, additional States began to regulate the discharge\nof firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,\n\u00a76, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTerritory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch.\nCCXCII, \u00a73, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.\n   Second, States began to regulate the possession of con\ncealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.\nSee, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early\nRepublic 143\u2013152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also\n1837\u20131838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200\u2013201 (banning\nthe wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.\nActs ch. 7, \u00a78, p. 110, (\u201cAny free person who shall habitu\nally carry about his person, hidden from common observa\ntion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like\nkind, from the use of which the death of any person might\nprobably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]\nfine not exceed fifty dollars\u201d).\n   State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,\nfinding that, even when the state constitution granted a\nright to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,\n\u201cabolish\u201d these small, inexpensive, \u201cmost dangerous weap\nons entirely from use,\u201d even in self-defense.

See\nante, at 10. The Court\u2019s case for incorporation must thus\nrest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is \u201cfun\n24                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndamental.\u201d But the very evidence that it advances in\nsupport of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri\ncans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows\nwith equal force that Americans wanted African-American\ncitizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did\nwhite citizens. Ante, at 22\u201333. Here, for example is what\nCongress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment\npredecessor, the Second Freedman\u2019s Bureau Act. It wrote\nthat the statute, in order to secure \u201cthe constitutional\nright to bear arms . . . for all citizens,\u201d would assure that\neach citizen:\n     \u201cshall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and\n     proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se\n     curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition\n     of estate, real and personal, including the constitu\n     tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all\n     the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re\n     spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\u201d\n     \u00a714, 14 Stat. 176\u2013177 (emphasis added).\nThis sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See\nRosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth\nAmendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of\nIncorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383\u2013384\n(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\nwas focused on discrimination).\n    Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See\n\u00a71, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of \u201cevery race and color, without\nregard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\nservitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in\nvarious activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens\u201d). And, of course, the\nFourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar\nantee their citizens the \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d\n    There is thus every reason to believe that the funda\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the\neradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new\nsubstantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state\npolice power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 62\u201369 (discussing congressional record evi\ndence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about\ndiscrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the\nFourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right\nto Southerners who had so recently waged war against the\nNorth, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently\nfreed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,\n\u00a76, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because\nthey were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).\n   Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th\ncentury was common. The majority is correct that the\nFreedmen\u2019s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it\nstands to reason, as the majority points out, that \u201c[i]t\nwould have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee\nthe . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.\u201d\nAnte, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that\nthere existed during this period a fundamental right to\nbear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason\nable exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The\nLimits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun\nRegulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &\nPol\u2019y Rev. 615, 621\u2013622 (2006) (noting that history shows\nthat \u201cnineteenth-century Americans\u201d were \u201cnot opposed to\nthe idea that the state should be able to control the use of\nfirearms\u201d).\n   To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a\nnumber of state constitutions adopted or amended after\nthe Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature\u2019s gen\neral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a713 (1869) (protecting \u201cthe right to keep and\nbear arms,\u201d \u201cunder such regulations as the legislature\nmay prescribe\u201d); Idaho Const., Art. I, \u00a711 (1889) (\u201cThe\n26                 MCDONALD v.

I, \u00a76 (1896) (same). And numerous other state\nconstitutional provisions adopted during this period ex\nplicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory\npower over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes\nsional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14\u201315 (hereinafter\nLegal Historians\u2019 Brief).\n   Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of\nall nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879\nTenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, \u00a71 (prohibiting citizens from\ncarrying \u201cpublicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket\npistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or\nnavy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car\nried openly in the hand\u201d); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,\n\u00a71 (forbidding \u201cconcealed or ope[n]\u201d bearing of \u201cany fire\narm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,\ntown or village\u201d); Ark.

Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols\nand other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians\u2019 Brief 16,\nn. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent\ngun controls, often in response to local conditions\u2014Dodge\nCity, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle\ntowns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger\nous weapons in response to violence accompanying west\nern cattle drives.

See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep\nand Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191, 205 (2006)\n(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor\ntance of this fact, we should keep the following considera\ntions in mind:\n   First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and\nmany local communities, highly detailed and complicated\nregulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)\nnearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell\nguns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns\nand what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms\nmust be stored and where they may be used; and so on.\nSee generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu\nlating Guns In America (2008), available at http://\nwww.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all\nInternet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (detailing various arms regu\nlations in every State).\n   Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban\nhandguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the\nright to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a78\u2013\n20\u2013050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \u00a7\u00a727\u20132\u2013\n1, 27\u20131\u20131 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25\n(2010).

See, e.g.,\nWinkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the \u201ccourts of every state to\nconsider\u201d a gun regulation apply the \u201c \u2018reasonable regula\ntion\u2019 \u201d approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238\n(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City & County of Denver, 874\nP. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).\n   When determining reasonableness those courts have\nnormally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards\nlegislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723\n(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti\ncle\u2019s publication striking down gun control laws: three that\nbanned \u201cthe transportation of any firearms for any pur\npose whatsoever,\u201d a single \u201cpermitting law,\u201d and two as\napplied challenges in \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d). Hence, as\nevidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States\nand local governments maintain substantial flexibility to\nregulate firearms\u2014much as they seemingly have through\nout the Nation\u2019s history\u2014even in those States with an\narms right in their constitutions.\n30                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Although one scholar implies that state courts are less\nwilling to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im\nplementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-\nDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research\nAgenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware\nof no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court\nhas struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a\nparticular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.\n   Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu\ntional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula\ntions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.\nVillage of Morton Grove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022759/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499, 470 N.

App.,\nAug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban \u201cdoes not absolutely interfere\nwith the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro\nscribes possession of a specifically defined category of\nhandguns\u201d); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d\n38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons\nunder 21 did not infringe arms right because they can\n\u201cposses[s] other types of guns\u201d). Thus, the majority\u2019s\ndecision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec\nognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re\ngimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.\n   Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few\nstate courts, a \u201cpaucity\u201d of state courts, have specifically\nupheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts\nhave struck them down? The absence of supporting in\nformation does not help the majority find support. Cf.\nUnited States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting\nthat it is \u201ctreacherous to find in congressional silence\nalone the adoption of a controlling rule of law\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend\nto show a consensus that a private self-defense right\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is \u201cdeeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d\n                         *   *     *\n   In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amend\nment in order to protect a private right of armed self\ndefense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the\nright is, or was, \u201cfundamental.\u201d No broader constitutional\ninterest or principle supports legal treatment of that right\nas fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional\nconcerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against\nthat treatment.\n   Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century\nhistory shows a consensus that the right to private armed\nself-defense, as described in Heller, is \u201cdeeply rooted in\nthis Nation\u2019s history or tradition\u201d or is otherwise \u201cfunda\nmental.\u201d Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in\nHeller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read\nin the majority\u2019s favor, the historical evidence is at most\nambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for\nits conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of\nself-defense against the States.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n32                  MCDONALD v.
