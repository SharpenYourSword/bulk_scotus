PUBLIC COM-\n\n     PANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u2013861.      Argued December 7, 2009\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was\n  created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-\n  Oxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed\n  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri\n  vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry\u2014such as\n  the New York Stock Exchange\u2014that investigate and discipline their\n  own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi\n  zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive\n  powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au\n  dits public companies under the securities laws must register with\n  the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over\n  sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves\n  tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.\n  The parties agree that the Board is \u201cpart of the Government\u201d for con\n  stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora\n  tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are \u201c \u2018Officers of the\n  United States\u2019 \u201d who \u201cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the\n  laws of the United States,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125\u2013126.\n  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board\n  members at will, but only \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d \u201cin accordance\n  with\u201d specified procedures. \u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also\n  agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re\n  moved by the President except for \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\n  malfeasance in office.\u2019 \u201d Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295\n  U. S. 602, 620.\n     The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report\n  critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.\n2          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza\n    tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,\n    seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon\n    stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its\n    powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened\n    the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board\n    members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis\n    for petitioners\u2019 challenge was that Board members were insulated\n    from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board\n    members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,\n    and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi\n    dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board\u2019s ap\n    pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi\n    cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and\n    consent, or\u2014in the case of \u201cinferior Officers\u201d\u2014by \u201cthe President\n    alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,\u201d\n    Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.\n    The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary\n    judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first\n    agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the\n    dual restraints on Board members\u2019 removal are permissible, and that\n    Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent\n    with the Appointments Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The\n Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag\n grieved party may challenge the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinal order\u201d or \u201crule\u201d\n in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. \u00a778y. The Government reads\n \u00a778y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly\n or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis\n trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju\n risdiction if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju\n dicial review\u201d; if the suit is \u201c \u2018wholly \u201ccollateral\u201d \u2019 to a statute\u2019s review\n provisions\u201d; and if the claims are \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212\u2013213.\n    These considerations point against any limitation on review here.\n Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti\n tioners\u2019 challenge is \u201ccollateral\u201d to any Commission orders or rules\n from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti\n tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti\n tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no \u201cmeaningful\u201d avenue of\n relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a\n sanction in order to test a law\u2019s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen\n tech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129. Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims are\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Pp. 7\u201310.\n   2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members\ncontravene the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Pp. 10\u201327.\n      (a) The Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he executive Power shall be\nvested in a President of the United States of America.\u201d Art. II, \u00a71,\ncl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower\nthe President to keep executive officers accountable\u2014by removing\nthem from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,\n272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not\nwithout limit. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, this Court held that\nCongress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen\ncies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the\nPresident may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in\nUnited States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of\nprincipal executive officers\u2014themselves responsible to the Presi\ndent\u2014to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not\naddressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten\nure. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the\nPresident\u2019s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa\nrated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The\nPresident\u2014or a subordinate he could remove at will\u2014decided\nwhether the officer\u2019s conduct merited removal under the good-cause\nstandard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re\nmoval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any\ndecision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in\nother tenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014who are not subject to\nthe President\u2019s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re\nmove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com\nmission fully accountable for the Board\u2019s conduct. He can only review\nthe Commissioner\u2019s determination of whether the Act\u2019s rigorous good\ncause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de\ntermination, he is powerless to intervene\u2014unless the determination\nis so unreasonable as to constitute \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance in office.\u2019 \u201d Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, at 620.\n   This arrangement contradicts Article II\u2019s vesting of the executive\npower in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or\nto attribute the Board\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee, the\nPresident is no longer the judge of the Board\u2019s conduct. He can nei\nther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon\nsible for a Board member\u2019s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re\n4          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    sponsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further\n    by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure. Such diffusion of\n    power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and\n    effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the\n    blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act\u2019s restrictions are\n    therefore incompatible with the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\n    Pp. 14\u201317.\n         (c) The \u201c \u2018fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven\n    ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing\n    alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. \u201d Bowsher\n    v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act\u2019s multilevel tenure protections\n    provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.\n    Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of\n    fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The\n    Framers created a structure in which \u201c[a] dependence on the people\u201d\n    would be the \u201cprimary controul on the government,\u201d and that de\n    pendence is maintained by giving each branch \u201cthe necessary consti\n    tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the\n    others.\u201d The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key \u201cconstitutional means\u201d\n    vested in the President was \u201cthe power of appointing, overseeing, and\n    controlling those who execute the laws.\u201d 1 Annals of Congress 463.\n    While a government of \u201copposite and rival interests\u201d may sometimes\n    inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n    51, at 349, \u201c[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc\n    tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving\n    liberty.\u201d Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17\u201321.\n         (d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con\n    straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\n    Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of\n    the Commission\u2019s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to\n    avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission\u2019s broad power over Board\n    functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter\n    ing the Board\u2019s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control\n    an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board\n    members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the\n    Commission\u2019s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board\n    may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of\n    the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no\n    tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro\n    managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids\n    any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi\n    nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub\n    stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of\n    good-cause removal. Pp. 21\u201327.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n   3. The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the\nremainder of the statute. Because \u201c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part\nof an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re\nmaining provisions,\u201d Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm\u2019n\nof Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the \u201cnormal rule\u201d is \u201cthat partial . . . in\nvalidation is the required course,\u201d Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\n472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board\u2019s existence does not violate the sepa\nration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by\n\u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric\ntions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains \u201c \u2018fully\noperative as a law,\u2019 \u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,\nand nothing in the Act\u2019s text or historical context makes it \u201cevident\u201d\nthat Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose\nmembers are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to\nfunction as before, but its members may be removed at will by the\nCommission. Pp. 27\u201329.\n   4. The Board\u2019s appointment is consistent with the Appointments\nClause. Pp. 29\u201333.\n      (a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment\nCongress may permissibly vest in a \u201cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\u201d Infe\nrior officers \u201care officers whose work is directed and supervised at\nsome level\u201d by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s\nconsent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662\u2013663. Because\nthe good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and\nvoid, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members\nat will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members\nare therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29\u201330.\n      (b) The Commission is a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d under the Appointments\nClause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi\ncally reserved the question whether a \u201cprincipal agenc[y], such as\u201d\nthe SEC, is a \u201cDepartmen[t].\u201d The Court now adopts the reasoning of\nthe concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that\nthe SEC is such a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d because it is a freestanding compo\nnent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within\nany other such component. This reading is consistent with the com\nmon, near-contemporary definition of a \u201cdepartment\u201d; with the early\npractice of Congress, see \u00a73, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court\u2019s cases,\nwhich have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of\nsuch an establishment. Pp. 30\u201331.\n      (c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cHea[d].\u201d The Commission\u2019s powers are generally\nvested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.

Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n951 (1983). Article II vests \u201c[t]he executive Power . . . in a\nPresident of the United States of America,\u201d who must\n\u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Art. II,\n\u00a71, cl. 1; id., \u00a73. In light of \u201c[t]he impossibility that one\nman should be able to perform all the great business of the\nState,\u201d the Constitution provides for executive officers to\n\u201cassist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties\nof his trust.\u201d 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.\nFitzpatrick ed. 1939).\n  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to\nempower the President to keep these officers account\u00ad\nable\u2014by removing them from office, if necessary. See\ngenerally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).\nThis Court has determined, however, that this authority is\nnot without limit. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStates, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,\nunder certain circumstances, create independent agencies\nrun by principal officers appointed by the President, whom\nthe President may not remove at will but only for good\ncause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483\n(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the\nCourt sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin\u00ad\ncipal executive officers\u2014themselves responsible to the\nPresident\u2014to remove their own inferiors. The parties do\nnot ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we\ndo not do so.\n  We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not\nyet encountered by the Court. The question is whether\nthese separate layers of protection may be combined. May\nthe President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin\u00ad\ncipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to\nremove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer\ndetermines the policy and enforces the laws of the United\nStates?\n  We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is\ncontrary to Article II\u2019s vesting of the executive power in\nthe President. The President cannot \u201ctake Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed\u201d if he cannot oversee the\nfaithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the\nPresident cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than\none level of good-cause protection, even if the President\ndetermines that the officer is neglecting his duties or\ndischarging them improperly. That judgment is instead\ncommitted to another officer, who may or may not agree\nwith the President\u2019s determination, and whom the Presi\u00ad\ndent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees\nwith him.

Among other measures, the Act introduced\ntighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board\nis composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5\u00ad\nyear terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in\nthe securities industry\u2014such as the New York Stock\nExchange\u2014that investigate and discipline their own\nmembers subject to Commission oversight. Congress\ncreated the Board as a private \u201cnonprofit corporation,\u201d and\nBoard members and employees are not considered Gov\u00ad\nernment \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s]\u201d for statutory purposes.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its\nmembers and employees from the private sector by paying\nsalaries far above the standard Government pay scale.\nSee \u00a7\u00a77211(f)(4), 7219.1\n   Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the\nBoard is a Government-created, Government-appointed\nentity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus\u00ad\ntry. Every accounting firm\u2014both foreign and domestic\u2014\nthat participates in auditing public companies under the\nsecurities laws must register with the Board, pay it an\nannual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.\n\u00a7\u00a77211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is\ncharged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu\u00ad\nrities laws, the Commission\u2019s rules, its own rules, and\nprofessional accounting standards. \u00a7\u00a77215(b)(1), (c)(4). To\nthis end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac\u00ad\ncounting firm\u2019s practice, including hiring and professional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The current salary for the Chairman is $673,000.   Other Board\nmembers receive $547,000. Brief for Petitioners 3.\n4       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The willful violation of any Board\nrule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex\u00ad\nchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778a et seq.\u2014\na federal crime punishable by up to 20 years\u2019 imprison\u00ad\nment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per\u00ad\nson). \u00a7\u00a778ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.). And the Board itself\ncan issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings,\nup to and including the permanent revocation of a firm\u2019s\nregistration, a permanent ban on a person\u2019s associating\nwith any registered firm, and money penalties of $15\nmillion ($750,000 for a natural person). \u00a77215(c)(4).\nDespite the provisions specifying that Board members are\nnot Government officials for statutory purposes, the par\u00ad\nties agree that the Board is \u201cpart of the Government\u201d for\nconstitutional purposes, Lebron v.

The parties agree that the Com\u00ad\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi\u00ad\ndent except under the Humphrey\u2019s Executor standard of\n\u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\u201d 295\nU.

The Board inspected the firm,\nreleased a report critical of its auditing procedures, and\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbegan a formal investigation. Beckstead and Watts and\nthe Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of\nwhich the firm is a member, then sued the Board and its\nmembers, seeking (among other things) a declaratory\njudgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an in\u00ad\njunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.\nApp. 71.\n   Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers\nby conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board\nmembers without subjecting them to Presidential control.\nId., at 67\u201368. Petitioners also challenged the Act under\nthe Appointments Clause, which requires \u201cOfficers of the\nUnited States\u201d to be appointed by the President with the\nSenate\u2019s advice and consent. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The Clause\nprovides an exception for \u201cinferior Officers,\u201d whose ap\u00ad\npointment Congress may choose to vest \u201cin the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart\u00ad\nments.\u201d Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC,\npetitioners argued that (1) Board members are not \u201cinfe\u00ad\nrior Officers\u201d who may be appointed by \u201cHeads of Depart\u00ad\nments\u201d; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a \u201cDe\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d; and (3) even if it is, the several\nCommissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its\n\u201cHea[d].\u201d See App. 68\u201370. The United States intervened\nto defend the Act\u2019s constitutionality. Both sides moved for\nsummary judgment; the District Court determined that it\nhad jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to re\u00ad\nspondents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a\u2013117a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 537 F. 3d 667\n(CADC 2008). It agreed that the District Court had juris\u00ad\ndiction over petitioners\u2019 claims. Id., at 671. On the mer\u00ad\nits, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue\nwas \u201ca question of first impression,\u201d as neither that court\nnor this one \u201cha[d] considered a situation where a restric\u00ad\ntion on removal passes through two levels of control.\u201d Id.,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 679. It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem\u00ad\nbers\u2019 removal are permissible because they do not \u201crender\nthe President unable to perform his constitutional duties.\u201d\nId., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the\nPresident \u201cdoes not directly select or supervise the Board\u2019s\nmembers,\u201d id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre\u00ad\nhensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s influence over the Commission implies a constitu\u00ad\ntionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at\n682\u2013683. The majority also held that Board members are\ninferior officers subject to the Commission\u2019s direction and\nsupervision, id., at 672\u2013676, and that their appointment is\notherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at\n676\u2013678.\n   Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case\nwas one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that\n\u201cthe double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .\ncombine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control\nover the [Board],\u201d id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also\nargued that Board members are not effectively supervised\nby the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers\nunder the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709\u2013712.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the District Court had juris\u00ad\ndiction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes\nproviding for judicial review of Commission action did not\nprevent the District Court from considering petitioners\u2019\nclaims.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to\nreview any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77217(b)(2)\u2013(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted,\naggrieved parties may challenge \u201ca final order of the\nCommission\u201d or \u201ca rule of the Commission\u201d in a court of\nappeals under \u00a778y, and \u201c[n]o objection . . . may be consid\u00ad\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nered by the court unless it was urged before the Commis\u00ad\nsion or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a778y(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1).\n   The Government reads \u00a778y as an exclusive route to\nreview. But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.\nProvisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review\nunless the \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d displays a \u201cfairly discerni\u00ad\nble\u201d intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue\n\u201care of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within\nth[e] statutory structure.\u201d Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.\nReich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates proce\u00ad\ndures \u201cdesigned to permit agency expertise to be brought\nto bear on particular problems,\u201d those procedures \u201care to\nbe exclusive.\u201d Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v.\nBank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420\n(1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to\nlimit jurisdiction if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose\nall meaningful judicial review\u201d; if the suit is \u201cwholly col\u00ad\nlateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and if the claims\nare \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d Thunder Basin,\nsupra, at 212\u2013213 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThese considerations point against any limitation on\nreview here.\n   We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pur\u00ad\nsue their constitutional claims under the Government\u2019s\ntheory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of\nCommission action, and not every Board action is encapsu\u00ad\nlated in a final Commission order or rule.\n   The Government suggests that petitioners could first\nhave sought Commission review of the Board\u2019s \u201cauditing\nstandards, registration requirements, or other rules.\u201d\nBrief for United States 16. But petitioners object to the\nBoard\u2019s existence, not to any of its auditing standards.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners\u2019 general challenge to the Board is \u201ccollateral\u201d\nto any Commission orders or rules from which review\nmight be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,\nInc., 498 U. S. 479, 491\u2013492 (1991). Requiring petitioners\nto select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd\nprocedure for Congress to choose, especially because only\nnew rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.\nSee 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).\n  Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to\nraise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for\nUnited States 16\u201317. But the investigation of Beckstead\nand Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),\nand an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject\nto judicial review, see \u00a77214(h)(2). So the Government\nproposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such\nas a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu\u00ad\nments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the\nCommission then affirms, the firm will win access to a\ncourt of appeals\u2014and severe punishment should its chal\u00ad\nlenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to \u201cbet\nthe farm . . . by taking the violative action\u201d before \u201ctesting\nthe validity of the law,\u201d MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,\nInc., 549 U. S. 118, 129 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young,\n209 U. S. 123 (1908), and we do not consider this a \u201cmean\u00ad\ningful\u201d avenue of relief. Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212.\n  Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims are also outside the\nCommission\u2019s competence and expertise. In Thunder\nBasin, the petitioner\u2019s primary claims were statutory; \u201cat\nroot . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll\nsquarely within the [agency\u2019s] expertise,\u201d given that the\nagency had \u201cextensive experience\u201d on the issue and had\n\u201crecently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.\u201d Id.,\nat 214\u2013215. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329\nU. S. 287 (1946), on which the Government relies, we\nreserved for the agency fact-bound inquiries that, even if\n10        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

S. 361, 373\n(1974). They are instead standard questions of adminis\u00ad\ntrative law, which the courts are at no disadvantage in\nanswering.\n   We therefore conclude that \u00a778y did not strip the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court of jurisdiction over these claims, which are\nproperly presented for our review.2\n                          III\n  We hold that the dual for-cause limitations on the re\u00ad\nmoval of Board members contravene the Constitution\u2019s\nseparation of powers.\n                          A\n  The Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he executive Power\nshall be vested in a President of the United States of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Government asserts that \u201cpetitioners have not pointed to any\n\ncase in which this Court has recognized an implied private right of\naction directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action\nunder the Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers principles.\u201d\nBrief for United States 22. The Government does not appear to dispute\nsuch a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particu\u00ad\nlar constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g., Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 74 (2001) (equitable relief \u201chas\nlong been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from\nacting unconstitutionally\u201d); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (\u201c[I]t\nis established practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdiction of\nfederal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights safeguarded by the\nConstitution\u201d); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 149, 165, 167\n(1908). If the Government\u2019s point is that an Appointments Clause or\nseparation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every\nother constitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority\nwhy that might be so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

As Madison stated on the floor\nof the First Congress, \u201cif any power whatsoever is in its\nnature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing,\nand controlling those who execute the laws.\u201d 1 Annals of\nCong. 463 (1789).\n   The removal of executive officers was discussed exten\u00ad\nsively in Congress when the first executive departments\nwere created. The view that \u201cprevailed, as most consonant\nto the text of the Constitution\u201d and \u201cto the requisite re\u00ad\nsponsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,\u201d\nwas that the executive power included a power to oversee\nexecutive officers through removal; because that tradi\u00ad\ntional executive power was not \u201cexpressly taken away, it\nremained with the President.\u201d Letter from James Madi\u00ad\nson to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary\nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). \u201cThis\nDecision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty\nevidence of the Constitution\u2019s meaning since many of the\nMembers of the First Congress had taken part in framing\nthat instrument.\u201d Bowsher v.

United States reaffirmed\nthe principle that Article II confers on the President \u201cthe\ngeneral administrative control of those executing the\nlaws.\u201d 272 U. S., at 164. It is his responsibility to take\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops\nwith the President, in Harry Truman\u2019s famous phrase. As\nwe explained in Myers, the President therefore must have\nsome \u201cpower of removing those for whom he can not con\u00ad\ntinue to be responsible.\u201d Id., at 117.\n   Nearly a decade later in Humphrey\u2019s Executor, this\nCourt held that Myers did not prevent Congress from\nconferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of\n12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

That case concerned the\nmembers of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7\u00ad\nyear terms and could not be removed by the President\nexcept for \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\noffice.\u2019 \u201d 295 U. S., at 620 (quoting 15 U. S. C. \u00a741). The\nCourt distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers\nconcerned \u201can officer [who] is merely one of the units in\nthe executive department and, hence, inherently subject to\nthe exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief\nExecutive, whose subordinate and aid he is.\u201d 295 U. S., at\n627. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as\n\u201cquasi-legislative and quasi-judicial\u201d rather than \u201cpurely\nexecutive,\u201d and held that Congress could require it \u201cto act\n. . . independently of executive control.\u201d Id., at 627\u2013629.\nBecause \u201cone who holds his office only during the pleasure\nof another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an atti\u00ad\ntude of independence against the latter\u2019s will,\u201d the Court\nheld that Congress had power to \u201cfix the period during\nwhich [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to\nforbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.\u201d\nId., at 629.\n    Humphrey\u2019s Executor did not address the removal of\ninferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in\nheads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily\nthe department head, rather than the President, who\nenjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119,\n127; Hennen, supra, at 259\u2013260.

Under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a\n\nprincipal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. \u00a7415, and\nthe Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his\nremoval. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. \u00a71767. This requirement\nwas widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally\nregarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,\n1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167\u2013\n168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986).\nPerkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in\ncombination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The\nCourt of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only\nthe authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthose circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.\nMorrison did not, however, address the consequences of\nmore than one level of good-cause tenure\u2014leaving the\nissue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, \u201ca\nquestion of first impression\u201d in this Court. 537 F. 3d, at\n679; see id., at 698 (dissenting opinion).\n                              B\n   As explained, we have previously upheld limited restric\u00ad\ntions on the President\u2019s removal power. In those cases,\nhowever, only one level of protected tenure separated the\nPresident from an officer exercising executive power. It\nwas the President\u2014or a subordinate he could remove at\nwill\u2014who decided whether the officer\u2019s conduct merited\nremoval under the good-cause standard.\n   The Act before us does something quite different. It not\nonly protects Board members from removal except for good\ncause, but withdraws from the President any decision on\nwhether that good cause exists. That decision is vested\ninstead in other tenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014\nnone of whom is subject to the President\u2019s direct control.\nThe result is a Board that is not accountable to the Presi\u00ad\ndent, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.\n   The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.\nWithout a layer of insulation between the Commission and\nthe Board, the Commission could remove a Board member\nat any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for\nwhat the Board does. The President could then hold the\nCommission to account for its supervision of the Board, to\nthe same extent that he may hold the Commission to\naccount for everything else it does.\n   A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of\nthe President\u2019s review. Now the Commission cannot\nremove a Board member at will. The President therefore\ncannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the\nBoard\u2019s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission accountable for everything else that it does.\nThe Commissioners are not responsible for the Board\u2019s\nactions. They are only responsible for their own determi\u00ad\nnation of whether the Act\u2019s rigorous good-cause standard\nis met. And even if the President disagrees with their\ndetermination, he is powerless to intervene\u2014unless that\ndetermination is so unreasonable as to constitute \u201cineffi\u00ad\nciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   This novel structure does not merely add to the Board\u2019s\nindependence, but transforms it. Neither the President,\nnor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer\nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full\ncontrol over the Board. The President is stripped of the\npower our precedents have preserved, and his ability to\nexecute the laws\u2014by holding his subordinates accountable\nfor their conduct\u2014is impaired.\n   That arrangement is contrary to Article II\u2019s vesting of\nthe executive power in the President. Without the ability\nto oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board\u2019s failings to\nthose whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the\njudge of the Board\u2019s conduct. He is not the one who de\u00ad\ncides whether Board members are abusing their offices or\nneglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the\nlaws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a\nBoard member\u2019s breach of faith. This violates the basic\nprinciple that the President \u201ccannot delegate ultimate\nresponsibility or the active obligation to supervise that\ngoes with it,\u201d because Article II \u201cmakes a single President\nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\u201d\nClinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 712\u2013713 (1997) (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in judgment).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 12\u201314 (opinion of\n\nBREYER, J.), the second layer of tenure protection does compromise the\n16       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Indeed, if allowed to stand, this dispersion of responsi\u00ad\nbility could be multiplied. If Congress can shelter the\nbureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why\nnot a third? At oral argument, the Government was un\u00ad\nwilling to concede that even five layers between the Presi\u00ad\ndent and the Board would be too many. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n47\u201348. The officers of such an agency\u2014safely encased\nwithin a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections\u2014would be\nimmune from Presidential oversight, even as they exer\u00ad\ncised power in the people\u2019s name.\n   Perhaps an individual President might find advantages\nin tying his own hands. But the separation of powers does\nnot depend on the views of individual Presidents, see\nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013880 (1991),\nnor on whether \u201cthe encroached-upon branch approves the\nencroachment,\u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992). The President can always choose to restrain\nhimself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot,\nhowever, choose to bind his successors by diminishing\ntheir powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his\nchoices by pretending that they are not his own.\n   The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of\naccountability. The people do not vote for the \u201cOfficers of\nthe United States.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. They instead look to\nthe President to guide the \u201cassistants or deputies . . .\nsubject to his superintendence.\u201d The Federalist No. 72, p.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPresident\u2019s ability to remove a Board member the Commission wants to\nretain. Without a second layer of protection, the Commission has no\nexcuse for retaining an officer who is not faithfully executing the law.\nWith the second layer in place, the Commission can shield its decision\nfrom Presidential review by finding that good cause is absent\u2014a\nfinding that, given the Commission\u2019s own protected tenure, the Presi\u00ad\ndent cannot easily overturn. The dissent describes this conflict merely\nas one of four possible \u201cscenarios,\u201d see post, at 12\u201313, but it is the\ncentral issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the\nPresident finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and\na statute prevents him from doing so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

That is why the\nFramers sought to ensure that \u201cthose who are employed in\nthe execution of the law will be in their proper situation,\nand the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest\nofficers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as\nthey ought, on the President, and the President on the\ncommunity.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).\n   By granting the Board executive power without the\nExecutive\u2019s oversight, this Act subverts the President\u2019s\nability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed\u2014as\nwell as the public\u2019s ability to pass judgment on his efforts.\nThe Act\u2019s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s separation of powers.\n                              C\n   Respondents and the dissent resist this conclusion,\nportraying the Board as \u201cthe kind of practical accommoda\u00ad\ntion between the Legislature and the Executive that\nshould be permitted in a \u2018workable government.\u2019 \u201d Metro\npolitan Washington Airports Authority v.

PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBoard is, we are told, simply one example of the \u201cvast\nnumbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,\nconcerned with vast numbers of different problems, [that]\nprovide for, or foresee, their execution or administration\nthrough the work of administrators organized within\nmany different kinds of administrative structures, exercis\u00ad\ning different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve\ntheir legislatively mandated objectives.\u201d Post, at 8.\n    No one doubts Congress\u2019s power to create a vast and\nvaried federal bureaucracy. But where, in all this, is the\nrole for oversight by an elected President? The Constitu\u00ad\ntion requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation\noversee the execution of the laws. And the \u201c \u2018fact that a\ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful\nin facilitating functions of government, standing alone,\nwill not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,\u2019 \u201d for\n\u201c \u2018[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objec\u00ad\ntives\u2014or the hallmarks\u2014of democratic government.\u2019 \u201d\nBowsher, 478 U. S., at 736 (quoting Chadha, 462 U. S., at\n944).\n    One can have a government that functions without\nbeing ruled by functionaries, and a government that bene\u00ad\nfits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our\nConstitution was adopted to enable the people to govern\nthemselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of\nthe Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and\ntouches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the\nconcern that it may slip from the Executive\u2019s control, and\nthus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab\u00ad\nsent from the dissent\u2019s paean to the administrative state.\n    For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of\nremoval as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s \u201cpower to get something done\u201d more often depends\non \u201cwho controls the agency\u2019s budget requests and fund\u00ad\ning, the relationships between one agency or department\nand another, . . . purely political factors (including Con\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Neither\nrespondents nor the dissent explains why the Board\u2019s\ntask, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer\nof insulation from the President\u2014or, for that matter, why\nonly two.

The\nPresident might have less than full confidence in, say, a\nBoard member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery\nis not listed among the grounds for removal under\n\u00a77217(d)(3).7\n   The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board\nmember may be removed was drawn from statutes con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The Government implausibly argues that \u00a77217(d)(3) \u201cdoes not ex\u00ad\n\npressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,\u201d and that\n\u201cthe Act could be construed to permit other grounds.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 51, n. 19. But having provided in \u00a77211(e)(6) that Board mem\u00ad\nbers are to be removed \u201cin accordance with [\u00a77217(d)(3)], for good cause\nshown,\u201d Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission\nfinding in \u00a77217(d)(3)\u2014including formal procedures and detailed\nconditions\u2014if Board members could also be removed without any\nfinding at all. Cf. PCAOB Brief 6 (\u201cCause exists where\u201d the \u00a77217(d)(3)\nconditions are met).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

While we need not\ndecide the question here, a removal standard appropriate\nfor limiting Government control over private bodies may\nbe inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power\nof the United States.\n   Alternatively, respondents portray the Act\u2019s limitations\non removal as irrelevant, because\u2014as the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals held\u2014the Commission wields \u201cat-will removal power\nover Board functions if not Board members.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at\n683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27\u2013\n28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission\u2019s general \u201coversight\nand enforcement authority over the Board,\u201d \u00a77217(a), is\nsaid to \u201cblun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause\nremoval,\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no\nworse off than \u201cif Congress had lodged the Board\u2019s func\u00ad\ntions in the SEC\u2019s own staff,\u201d PCAOB Brief 15.\n   Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members. The Commission\nmay, for example, approve the Board\u2019s budget, \u00a77219(b),\nissue binding regulations, \u00a7\u00a77202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve\nthe Board of authority, \u00a77217(d)(1), amend Board sanc\u00ad\ntions, \u00a77217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,\n\u00a7\u00a77202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an\nagency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe\u00ad\nrior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to\nsupervise individual members if it must destroy the Board\nin order to fix it.\n   Even if Commission power over Board activities could\nsubstitute for authority over its members, we would still\nreject respondents\u2019 premise that the Commission\u2019s power\nin this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is\nempowered to take significant enforcement actions, and\ndoes so largely independently of the Commission. See\nsupra, at 3\u20134. Its powers are, of course, subject to some\nlatent Commission control. See supra, at 4\u20135. But the Act\n24       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnowhere gives the Commission effective power to start,\nstop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive\nactivities typically carried out by officials within the Ex\u00ad\necutive Branch.\n  The Government and the dissent suggest that the Com\u00ad\nmission could govern and direct the Board\u2019s daily exercise\nof prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC\nrules, or by amending those of the Board. Brief for United\nStates 27; post, at 15. Enacting general rules through the\nrequired notice and comment procedures is obviously a\npoor means of micromanaging the Board\u2019s affairs. See\n\u00a7\u00a778s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7553, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a77202(a), PCAOB Brief 24, n. 6.8 So the Govern\u00ad\nment offers another proposal, that the Commission require\nthe Board by rule to \u201csecure SEC approval for any actions\nthat it now may take itself.\u201d Brief for United States 27.\nThat would surely constitute one of the \u201climitations upon\nthe activities, functions, and operations of the Board\u201d that\nthe Act forbids, at least without Commission findings\nequivalent to those required to fire the Board instead.\n\u00a77217(d)(2). The Board thus has significant independence\nin determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs\nof regulated firms (and the lives of their associated per\u00ad\nsons) without Commission preapproval or direction.\n  Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is\ncontradicted by the past practice of Congress. But the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing\nsubstantial executive authority to officers protected by two\nlayers of for-cause removal\u2014including at one level a\nsharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes \u201cgood\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, see post, at 15\u201316, the Commis\u00ad\n\nsion\u2019s powers to conduct its own investigations (with its own resources),\nto remove particular provisions of law from the Board\u2019s bailiwick, or to\nrequire the Board to perform functions \u201cother\u201d than inspections and\ninvestigations, \u00a77211(c)(5), are no more useful in directing individual\nenforcement actions.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., PCAOB Brief\n43. \tAs Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:\n     \u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of the severe con\u00ad\n     stitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of his\u00ad\n     torical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority\n     opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as in\u00ad\n     tervenor has located any historical analogues for this\n     novel structure. They have not identified any inde\u00ad\n     pendent agency other than the PCAOB that is ap\u00ad\n     pointed by and removable only for cause by another\n     independent agency.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 669.\n   The dissent here suggests that other such positions\nmight exist, and complains that we do not resolve their\nstatus in this opinion. Post, at 23\u201331. The dissent itself,\nhowever, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal\nGovernment, see post, at 7\u20138, and those features discour\u00ad\nage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed\nnor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support\nits premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies\nare similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 28\u201331.\n   For example, many civil servants within independent\nagencies would not qualify as \u201cOfficers of the United\nStates,\u201d who \u201cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to\nthe laws of the United States,\u201d Buckley, 424 U.

Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 509 (1879). The applicable\nproportion has of course increased dramatically since 1879.\n26       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee supra, at 4; see also Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. We do not decide\nthe status of other Government employees, nor do we\ndecide whether \u201clesser functionaries subordinate to offi\u00ad\ncers of the United States\u201d must be subject to the same sort\nof control as those who exercise \u201csignificant authority\npursuant to the laws.\u201d Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.\n   Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy\nthe same significant and unusual protections from Presi\u00ad\ndential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or\npolicymaking positions in government may be excepted\nfrom the competitive service to ensure Presidential con\u00ad\ntrol, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and\nmembers of the Senior Executive Service may be reas\u00ad\nsigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies\nmay be excluded from that Service by the President), see,\ne.g., \u00a7\u00a73132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.\n\u00a72302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority\nis not before us, any such authority is of course wholly\nabsent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,\ntherefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what\nis colloquially known as the civil service system within\nindependent agencies.10\n   Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests\nthat today\u2019s opinion might increase the President\u2019s author\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset\n\nof independent agency employees who serve as administrative law\njudges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law\njudges are necessarily \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d is disputed. See,\ne.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem\u00ad\nbers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform\nadjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see\n\u00a7\u00a7554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov\u00ad\nernment below refused to identify either \u201ccivil service tenure-protected\nemployees in independent agencies\u201d or administrative law judges as\n\u201cprecedent for the PCAOB.\u201d 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07\u20135127\n(CADC), pp. 32, 37\u201338, 42.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Without expressing any\nview whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough\nto note that we see little analogy between our Nation\u2019s\narmed services and the Public Company Accounting Over\u00ad\nsight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi\u00ad\ndential control through the chain of command and through\nthe President\u2019s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,\n\u00a72, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7162, 164(g). The President\nand his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry\nor courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor\nperformance by those officers. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7822(a)(1),\n823(a)(1), 892(3), 933\u2013934, 1181\u20131185. Here, by contrast,\nthe President has no authority to initiate a Board mem\u00ad\nber\u2019s removal for cause.\n   There is no reason for us to address whether these\npositions identified by the dissent, or any others not at\nissue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the\nPresident\u2019s constitutional authority. Nor is there any\nsubstance to the dissent\u2019s concern that the \u201cwork of all\nthese various officials\u201d will \u201cbe put on hold.\u201d Post, at 31.\nAs the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting\ncertain officers to a single level of insulation from the\nPresident affects the conditions under which those officers\nmight some day be removed, and would have no effect,\nabsent a congressional determination to the contrary, on\nthe validity of any officer\u2019s continuance in office. The only\nissue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the\nPresident of adequate control over the Board, which is the\nregulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement\nauthority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it\ncannot.\n                            IV\n  Petitioners\u2019 complaint argued that the Board\u2019s \u201cfreedom\nfrom Presidential oversight and control\u201d rendered it \u201cand\nall power and authority exercised by it\u201d in violation of the\n28      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nConstitution. App. 46. We reject such a broad holding.\nInstead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti\u00ad\ntutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain\u00ad\nder of the statute.\n   \u201cGenerally speaking, when confronting a constitutional\nflaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob\u00ad\nlem,\u201d severing any \u201cproblematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.\u201d       Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328\u2013329 (2006). Be\u00ad\ncause \u201c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not\nnecessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining\nprovisions,\u201d Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation\nComm\u2019n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the \u201cnormal\nrule\u201d is \u201cthat partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the\nrequired course,\u201d Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472\nU. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners\u2019\nAppointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the\nexistence of the Board does not violate the separation of\npowers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed\nby \u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional\ndefault rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint\u00ad\nment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,\nn. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13\nPet., at 259\u2013260. Concluding that the removal restrictions\nare invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will, and leaves the President separated from Board\nmembers by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The\nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board\u2019s ac\u00ad\ntions, which are no less subject than the Commission\u2019s\nown functions to Presidential oversight.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains \u201c \u2018fully operative as a\nlaw\u2019 \u201d with these tenure restrictions excised. New York,\n505 U. S., at 186 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,\n480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its\nremaining provisions \u201c[u]nless it is evident that the Legis\u00ad\nlature would not have enacted those provisions . . . inde\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Though this inquiry can some\u00ad\ntimes be \u201celusive,\u201d Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer\nhere seems clear: The remaining provisions are not \u201cinca\u00ad\npable of functioning independently,\u201d Alaska Airlines, 480\nU. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute\u2019s text or historical\ncontext makes it \u201cevident\u201d that Congress, faced with the\nlimitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre\u00ad\nferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are\nremovable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.\n  It is true that the language providing for good-cause\nremoval is only one of a number of statutory provisions\nthat, working together, produce a constitutional violation.\nIn theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi\u00ad\ncient number of the Board\u2019s responsibilities so that its\nmembers would no longer be \u201cOfficers of the United\nStates.\u201d Or we could restrict the Board\u2019s enforcement\npowers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory\npanel. Or the Board members could in future be made\nremovable by the President, for good cause or at will. But\nsuch editorial freedom\u2014far more extensive than our hold\u00ad\ning today\u2014belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\nCongress of course remains free to pursue any of these\noptions going forward.\n                             V\n  Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board\nunder the Appointments Clause. None has merit.\n  First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi\u00ad\npal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the\nSenate\u2019s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U. S. 651, 662\u2013663 (1997), that\n\u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether\nhe has a superior,\u201d and that \u201c \u2018inferior officers\u2019 are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level\u201d by\nother officers appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsent. In particular, we noted that \u201c[t]he power to\nremove officers\u201d at will and without cause \u201cis a powerful\ntool for control\u201d of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained\nabove, the statutory restrictions on the Commission\u2019s\npower to remove Board members are unconstitutional and\nvoid. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,\nunder the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove\nBoard members at will, and given the Commission\u2019s other\noversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding\nthat under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi\u00ad\ncers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in\na \u201cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\u201d\n   But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a \u201cDe\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d like the \u201cExecutive departments\u201d (e.g., State,\nTreasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. \u00a7101. In Freytag,\n501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques\u00ad\ntion whether a \u201cprincipal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi\u00ad\nties and Exchange Commission,\u201d is a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d\nunder the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,\nwould have concluded that the Commission is indeed such\na \u201cDepartmen[t],\u201d see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), because it is a \u201cfree\u00ad\nstanding, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,\u201d\nid., at 915.\n   Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those\nentities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief\nfor United States 37\u201339; PCAOB Brief 30\u201333, and we do.\nRespondents\u2019 reading of the Appointments Clause is con\u00ad\nsistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of\na \u201cdepartment\u201d as a \u201cseparate allotment or part of busi\u00ad\nness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are\nallotted to a particular person.\u201d 1 N. Webster, American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995\nfacsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice\nof Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster\nGeneral to appoint \u201can assistant, and deputy postmasters,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat all places where such shall be found necessary,\u201d \u00a73, 1\nStat. 234\u2014thus treating him as the \u201cHea[d] of [a] De\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d without the title of Secretary or any role in\nthe President\u2019s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our\nprior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment\nmade by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,\nsupra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,\n515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511\n(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo\u00ad\nnent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con\u00ad\ntained within any other such component, it constitutes a\n\u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d for the purposes of the Appointments\nClause.11\n   But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the\nfull Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board\nmembers, because only the Chairman of the Commission\nis the Commission\u2019s \u201cHea[d].\u201d12 The Commission\u2019s powers,\nhowever, are generally vested in the Commissioners\njointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a777s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to\nthe Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive\nfunctions subject to the full Commission\u2019s policies. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an \u201cexecu\u00ad\n\ntive Departmen[t]\u201d under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 1, or\nunder Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886\u2013887 (1991).\n   12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this\n\nclaim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the\nChairman\u2019s objection, and so petitioners\u2019 injuries are not fairly trace\u00ad\nable to an invalid appointment.

The\nChairman is also appointed from among the Commission\u00ad\ners by the President alone, id., \u00a73, at 1266, which means\nthat he cannot be regarded as \u201cthe head of an agency\u201d for\npurposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S.

Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi\u00ad\nnation of principal officers in the President to avoid the\nperceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal\nno similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose\nappointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul\u00ad\ntimember bodies.

It argues that granting\nthe \u201cinferior officer[s]\u201d on the Accounting Board \u201cmore\nthan one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the\nPresident\u2019s \u2018constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful\nexecution of the laws.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2.

And the\nCourt\u2019s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the\nfair and efficient administration of the laws.

On the one hand,\nCongress has broad power to enact statutes \u201cnecessary\nand proper\u201d to the exercise of its specifically enumerated\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nconstitutional authority. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. As Chief Jus\ntice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers\u2019 efforts\nto create a Constitution that would \u201cendure for ages to\ncome.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).\nIt embodies their recognition that it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to\nprescribe \u201cthe means by which government should, in all\nfuture time, execute its powers.\u201d Ibid. Such \u201cimmutable\nrules\u201d would deprive the Government of the needed flexi\nbility to respond to future \u201cexigencies which, if foreseen at\nall, must have been seen dimly.\u201d Ibid. Thus the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority\nto \u201ccreate\u201d governmental \u201c \u2018offices\u2019 \u201d and to structure those\noffices \u201cas it chooses.\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138\n(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355\n(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the\npast century to create numerous federal agencies in re\nsponse to \u201cvarious crises of human affairs\u201d as they have\narisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.\nWong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36\u201337 (1950).\n   On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,\nand III of the Constitution separately and respectively\nvest \u201call legislative Powers\u201d in Congress, the \u201cexecutive\nPower\u201d in the President, and the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d in the\nSupreme Court (and such \u201cinferior Courts as Congress\nmay from time to time ordain and establish\u201d). In doing so,\nthese provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers\nprinciple. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341\u2013\n342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction\nin Article II, \u00a73 that the President \u201cshall take Care that\nthe Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d limits Congress\u2019 power to\nstructure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis\nsioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

S. 833, 859\u2013860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held\nthat the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the\nPresident the authority to dismiss certain Executive\nBranch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.\n52 (1926).\n   But neither of these two principles is absolute in its\napplication to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper\nClause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu\ntive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the\nPresident. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin\nciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove\nany and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,\ndepending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or\nits subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent\nwith the Constitution, limit the President\u2019s authority to\nremove an officer from his post. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor\nv. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).\nAnd we must here decide whether the circumstances\nsurrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.\n   In answering the question presented, we cannot look to\nmore specific constitutional text, such as the text of the\nAppointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon\nwhich the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers\ncases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at\n124\u2013125. That is because, with the exception of the gen\neral \u201cvesting\u201d and \u201ctake care\u201d language, the Constitution\nis completely \u201csilent with respect to the power of removal\nfrom office.\u201d Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see\nalso Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cThere is, of course, no provision in the Constitution\nstating who may remove executive officers . . . \u201d).\n   Nor does history offer significant help. The President\u2019s\npower to remove Executive Branch officers \u201cwas not dis\ncussed in the Constitutional Convention.\u201d Myers, supra,\nat 109\u2013110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes\n4       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthat limited the President\u2019s ability to oversee Executive\nBranch officials, including the Comptroller of the United\nStates, federal district attorneys (precursors to today\u2019s\nUnited States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the\nSecretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By\nOur Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183\u2013184\n(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi\ncers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B. U.

But those statutes\ndid not directly limit the President\u2019s authority to remove\nany of those officials\u2014\u201ca subject\u201d that was \u201cmuch dis\nputed\u201d during \u201cthe early history of this government,\u201d \u201cand\nupon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.\u201d\nHennen, supra, at 259; see also United States ex rel.

Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin\nued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should\nbe drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also\nabout the nature of the original disagreement. Compare\nante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,\nC. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91\nCornell L. Rev. 1021 (2006), with, e.g., Myers, supra, at\n194 (McReynolds, J., dissenting); Corwin, Tenure of Office\nand the Removal Power Under the Constitution, 27 Colum.\nL.

Fisher, President\nand Congress: Power and Policy 86\u201389 (1972).\n   Nor does this Court\u2019s precedent fully answer the ques\ntion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the\nprovision in dispute. See Part II\u2013C, infra. In Myers,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, the Court invalidated\u2014for the first and only time\u2014\na congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim\nited the President\u2019s authority to remove an Executive\nBranch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly\ndisapproved most of Myers\u2019 broad reasoning. See Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626\u2013627, overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352\n(1958) (stating that Humphrey\u2019s Executor \u201cexplicitly \u2018dis\napproved\u2019 \u201d of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,\nthe Court has since said that \u201cthe essence of the decision\nin Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents\nCongress from \u2018draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove\nor the right to participate in the exercise of that power.\u2019 \u201d\nMorrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea\nture of the statute\u2014a feature that would aggrandize the\npower of Congress\u2014is not present here. Congress has not\ngranted itself any role in removing the members of the\nAccounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (\u201csepara\ntion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the\ndanger of one branch\u2019s aggrandizing its power at the\nexpense of another branch\u201d (emphasis added)); Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com\npare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress\ngranted itself removal authority over Executive Branch\nofficial), with Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, (upholding\nstatute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,\nsupra (same); Morrison, supra (same).\n   In short, the question presented lies at the intersection\nof two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional\nprinciples. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent\nprovides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527\nU. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that\n\u201cthis Court\u201d is \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d when \u201cit deals with\njudge-made constitutional law\u201d that lacks \u201croots in the\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53\n(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the\nCourt said that \u201cregard must be had, as in other cases\nwhere constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat\nters of form, but to the substance of what is required.\u201d\nThe Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in\nMorrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court\nmust look \u201c \u2018beyond form to the substance of what\u2019 Con\ngress has done\u201d); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689\u2013690 (\u201cThe\nanalysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to\ndefine rigid categories of those officials who may or may\nnot be removed at will by the President,\u201d but rather asks\nwhether, given the \u201cfunctions of the officials in question,\u201d\na removal provision \u201cinterfere[s] with the President\u2019s\nexercise of the \u2018executive power\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). The\nCourt has thereby written into law Justice Jackson\u2019s wise\nperception that \u201cthe Constitution . . . contemplates that\npractice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka\nble government.\u201d Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). See also ibid. (\u201cThe actual art of gov\nerning under our Constitution does not and cannot con\nform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its\nbranches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles\ntorn from context\u201d).\n   It is not surprising that the Court in these circum\nstances has looked to function and context, and not to\nbright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies\nthe intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow\nthe three coordinate branches, including this Court, to\nexercise practical judgment in response to changing condi\ntions and \u201cexigencies,\u201d which at the time of the founding\ncould be seen only \u201cdimly,\u201d and perhaps not at all.\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.\n   For another, a functional approach permits Congress\nand the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory\nlaw to changing circumstances. That is why the \u201cpowers\nconferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu\ntion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for\nthe expansion of the Federal Government\u2019s role\u201d over time.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).\nIndeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found\ning consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu\nlation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the\nFederal Personnel System, in The Federal Government\nService 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,\nCensus Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:\nColonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,\nthe Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work\ners who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people\nliving in a society characterized by rapid technological,\neconomic, and social change. See Office of Management\nand Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.\nGovernment, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).\n   Federal statutes now require or permit Government\nofficials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not\nonly foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of\nsuch subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,\npharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,\nelectricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru\nments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,\nthe environment, fair employment practices, consumer\nprotection and much else besides.

C.\n\u00a79902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. \u00a7136i\u20131(g); and\nsometimes they permit state or local governments to\nparticipate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a72009aa\u20131(a). Statutes\nsimilarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers\u2014\nfor example, the power to make rules, develop informal\npractices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant\nlicenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.\nSee generally 5 U. S. C. \u00a7500 et seq.\n   The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov\nerning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast\nnumbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,\ntheir execution or administration through the work of\nadministrators organized within many different kinds of\nadministrative structures, exercising different kinds of\nadministrative authority, to achieve their legislatively\nmandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov\nernment\u2019s work, it is not surprising that administrative\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nunits come in many different shapes and sizes.\n   The functional approach required by our precedents\nrecognizes this administrative complexity and, more im\nportantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power\noperates within this context\u2014and the various ways in\nwhich a removal provision might affect that power. As\nhuman beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself\nto the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens\u2019 song, some\ntimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve\na broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit\nments\u2014such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly\nbe changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish\nment of independent administrative institutions\u2014hold the\npotential to empower precisely because of their ability to\nconstrain. If the President seeks to regulate through\nimpartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator\nfrom removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And\nto free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal\nwithout cause can similarly help create legitimacy with\nrespect to that official\u2019s regulatory actions by helping to\ninsulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political\npressure.\n   Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of\nelementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a\nPresident\u2019s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule\nthat takes power from the President\u2019s opponents may\nstrengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a\nfunctionally neutral independent authority? In that case,\nit is difficult to predict how the President\u2019s power is af\nfected in the abstract.\n   These practical reasons not only support our precedents\u2019\ndetermination that cases such as this should examine the\nspecific functions and context at issue; they also indicate\nthat judges should hesitate before second-guessing a \u201cfor\ncause\u201d decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,\nChadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a \u201cpresumption that\n10      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Compared to\nCongress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an\ninferior understanding of the realities of administration,\nand the manner in which power, including and most espe\ncially political power, operates in context.\n  There is no indication that the two comparatively more\nexpert branches were divided in their support for the \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em\nbodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in\nthe House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the\nSenate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation\nof the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in\nboth bodies without anyone finding in its structure any\nconstitutional problem. See id., at 12035\u201312037, 12112\u2013\n12132, 12315\u201312323, 12372\u201312377, 12488\u201312508, 12529\u2013\n12534, 12612\u201312618, 12673\u201312680, 12734\u201312751, 12915\u2013\n12960, 13347\u201313354, 14439\u201314458, 14487\u201314506. The\nPresident signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a\nsigning statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the\nAct but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.\nSee President\u2019s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres.

In practical terms no \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision can, in isolation, define the full measure\nof executive power. This is because a legislative decision\nto place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the\nSecretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the\nway in which the statute defines the scope of the power\nthe relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to\nwho controls the agency\u2019s budget requests and funding,\nthe relationships between one agency or department and\nanother, as well as more purely political factors (including\nCongress\u2019 ability to assert influence) are more likely to\naffect the President\u2019s power to get something done. That\nis why President Truman complained that \u201c \u2018the powers of\nthe President amount to\u2019 \u201d bringing \u201c \u2018people in and try[ing]\nto persuade them to do what they ought to do without\npersuasion.\u2019 \u201d C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154\n(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written\nthat the President \u201cis neither dominant nor powerless\u201d in\nhis relationships with many Government entities,\n\u201cwhether denominated executive or independent.\u201d Strauss,\nThe Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow\ners and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum.

See Bruff, Bringing the Inde\npendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.\nEn Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.\norg/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf\n(noting that \u201cPresidents do not test the limits of their\npower by removing commissioners . . . \u201d); Lessig & Sun\nstein 110\u2013112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to\ndefine what constitutes \u201ccause\u201d because Presidents rarely\ntest removal provisions).\n   But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we\nshould still conclude that the \u201cfor cause\u201d restriction before\nus will not restrict presidential power significantly. For\none thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi\ndent\u2019s power, but the power of an already independent\nagency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when\nit identifies its central constitutional problem: According\nto the Court, the President \u201cis powerless to intervene\u201d if he\nhas determined that the Board members\u2019 \u201cconduct merit[s]\nremoval\u201d because \u201c[t]hat decision is vested instead in other\ntenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014none of whom is\nsubject to the President\u2019s direct control.\u201d Ante, at 14\u201315.\nBut so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from\nremoving the Commissioners except for cause (as the\nmajority assumes), nullifying the Commission\u2019s power to\nremove Board members only for cause will not resolve the\nproblem the Court has identified: The President will still\nbe \u201cpowerless to intervene\u201d by removing the Board mem\nbers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.\n   In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of\n\u201cfor cause\u201d protection\u2014Layer One insulating the Commis\nsioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the\nBoard from the Commissioners\u2014impose any more serious\nlimitation upon the President\u2019s powers than one layer.\nConsider the four scenarios that might arise:\n    1. The President and the Commission both want to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n        keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is\n        relevant.\n    2. The President and the Commission both want to\n        dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them\n        both from doing so without cause. The President\u2019s\n        ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is\n        irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in\n        agreement.\n    3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,\n        but the Commission wants to keep the member.\n        Layer One allows the Commission to make that de\n        termination notwithstanding the President\u2019s con\n        trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the\n        Commission does not seek to remove the Board\n        member.\n    4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but\n        the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem\n        ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it\n        hinders the Commission\u2019s ability to dismiss a Board\n        member whom the President wants to keep in\n        place.\n  Thus, the majority\u2019s decision to eliminate only Layer\nTwo accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a\nremoval restriction\u2019s effect upon presidential power de\npends not on the presence of a \u201cdouble-layer\u201d of for-cause\nremoval, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real\nworld nature of the President\u2019s relationship with the\nCommission. If the President confronts a Commission\nthat seeks to resist his policy preferences\u2014a distinct pos\nsibility when, as here, a Commission\u2019s membership must\nreflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778d(a)\u2014the\nrestriction on the Commission\u2019s ability to remove a Board\nmember is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may\nactually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the\nPresident faces a Commission that seeks to implement his\npolicy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndent and Commission see eye to eye.\n  In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates\ntwo alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission\nand the President both want to remove a Board member,\nbut have varying judgments as to whether they have good\n\u201ccause\u201d to do so\u2014i.e., the President and the Commission\nboth conclude that a Board member should be removed,\nbut disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they\nhave both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14\u201315. In the\nsecond, the President wants to remove a Board member\nand the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its\nfreedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the\nPresident (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while\napparently telling the President that it agrees with him\nand would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer\nTwo as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to pursue its actual aims\u2014an excuse\nwhich, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.\n  Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not\nknow if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their\nlogical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And\nthe fact that, with respect to the President\u2019s power, the\ndouble layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,\nsometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over\nall effect is at most indeterminate.\n  But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and\nview the removal provision at issue in the context of the\nentire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily\napparent. That is because the statute provides the Com\nmission with full authority and virtually comprehensive\ncontrol over all of the Board\u2019s functions. Those who cre\nated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc\nture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod\nies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange and other similar self\nregulating organizations. See generally Brief for Former\nChairmen of the SEC as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations\u2014\nwhich rely on private financing and on officers drawn from\nthe private sector\u2014exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory\nauthority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed\n\u201centirely derivative\u201d of, the SEC. See National Assn. of\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC\n2005).\n   Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac\ncounting Board the power to adopt rules and standards\n\u201crelating to the preparation of audit reports\u201d; to adjudicate\ndisciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that\nfail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en\ngage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec\ntions of accounting firms registered as the law requires\nand investigations to monitor compliance with the rules\nand related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77211\u2013\n7216.

Moreover, the Com\nmission has general supervisory powers over the Account\ning Board itself: It controls the Board\u2019s budget, \u00a7\u00a77219(b),\n(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any \u201cduties or functions\u201d\nthat it \u201cdetermines are necessary or appropriate,\u201d\n\u00a77211(c)(5); it has full \u201coversight and enforcement author\nity over the Board,\u201d \u00a77217(a), including the authority to\ninspect the Board\u2019s activities whenever it believes it \u201cap\npropriate\u201d to do so, \u00a77217(d)(2) (emphasis added).

See 15\nU. S. C. \u00a77215.

Rev. 1111,\n1131\u20131133 (2000) (explaining how the need for adminis\ntrators with \u201ctechnical competence,\u201d \u201capolitical expertise,\u201d\nand skill in \u201cscientific management\u201d led to original crea\ntion of independent agencies) (hereinafter Breger & Ed\nles); J.

S. ____ (2010)             19\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Here, the justification for insulating the \u201ctechnical\nexperts\u201d on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to\npolitical influence is particularly strong. Congress delib\nerately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,\n148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352\u201313355. It did so for\ngood reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting\nBoard was created in response to \u201ca series of celebrated\naccounting debacles\u201d); H. R. Rep. No. 107\u2013414, pp. 18\u201319\n(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8\u20139. And\nhistorically, this regulatory subject matter\u2014financial\nregulation\u2014has been thought to exhibit a particular need\nfor independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)\n(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal\nTrade Commission) (\u201c[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra\ntive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold\nthe power of life and death over the great business inter\nests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .\ntaking these business matters out of politics\u201d). And Con\ngress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess, \u00a77219, helped insulate the Board from congres\nsional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148\nCong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).\n   In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably\nhave thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board\nmembers from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565\n(1973) (\u201c[I]t is not only important that the Government\nand its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,\nbut it is also critical that they appear to the public to be\navoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative\nGovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent\u201d).\nAnd in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern\nment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear\npower production, the Court\u2019s assertion that we should\nsimply learn to get by \u201cwithout being\u201d regulated \u201cby ex\n20      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nperts\u201d is, at best, unrealistic\u2014at worst, dangerously so.\nAnte, at 18.\n                               C\n   Where a \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is so unlikely to restrict\npresidential power and so likely to further a legitimate\ninstitutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti\ntutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon\nv. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),\nthe Court made clear that when \u201cdetermining whether the\nAct disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to\nwhich it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish\ning its constitutionally assigned functions.\u201d Id., at 443.\nThe Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a\nrestriction on the President\u2019s removal power. 487 U. S., at\n691 (\u201c[T]he real question is whether the removal restric\ntions are of such a nature that they impede the President\u2019s\nability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func\ntions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that\nlight\u201d). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat\ndiminish the Commission\u2019s ability to control the Board,\nbut it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to\nthe President\u2019s ability to control the Board, let alone to\ncoordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II\u2013A, supra.\nIndeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric\ntion that significantly interfered with the President\u2019s\nimportant historic power to control criminal prosecutions,\na \u201c \u2018purely executive\u2019 \u201d function, 487 U. S., at 687\u2013689, the\nconstitutionality of the present restriction would seem to\nfollow a fortiori.\n   Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re\npeatedly upheld \u201cfor cause\u201d provisions where they restrict\nthe President\u2019s power to remove an officer with adjudica\ntory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295\nU. S., at 623\u2013628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at\n17\u201318 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also\nupheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with\ntechnical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special\nindependence. E.g., Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, at 624.\nThe Accounting Board\u2019s functions involve both kinds of\nresponsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board\u2019s\nadjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its\njob, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor\ntance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job\nto the public strongly justify a statute that assures that\nBoard members need not fear for their jobs when compe\ntently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the\nCommission as the ultimate authority over Board policies\nand actions. See Part II\u2013B, supra.\n  Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way\nthat logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.\nIn Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484\u2014which was reaffirmed\nin Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,\nn. 27\u2014the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the\nauthority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a \u201ccadet\nengineer,\u201d whom the Court explicitly defined as an \u201cinfe\nrior officer.\u201d The Court said,\n       \u201cWe have no doubt that when Congress, by law,\n    vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads\n    of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of\n    removal as it deems best for the public interest. The\n    constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the\n    appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and\n    regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may\n    enact in relation to the officers so appointed.\u201d Per\n    kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota\n    tion marks omitted).\nSee also Morrison, supra, at 723\u2013724 (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning) (agreeing that the power to remove an \u201cinferior offi\n22      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Cf. ante, at 30\u201333 (holding that SEC Commis\nsioners are \u201cHeads of Departments\u201d).\n   In Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the Court held that Congress\nmay constitutionally limit the President\u2019s authority to\nremove certain principal officers, including heads of de\npartments. 295 U. S., at 627\u2013629. And the Court has\nconsistently recognized the validity of that holding. See\nWiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706\n(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133\u2013136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,\nat 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725\u2013726; Morrison,\nsupra, at 686\u2013693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 410\u2013411 (1989).\n   And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated\nin a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, that \u201cadjusting the remainder of the\nConstitution to compensate for Humphrey\u2019s Executor is a\nfruitless endeavor.\u201d In these Justices\u2019 view, the Court\nshould not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence\nfor the \u201cindependent agencies.\u201d That being so, the law\nshould treat their heads as it treats other Executive\nBranch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court\nheld in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally \u201climit and\nrestrict\u201d the Commission\u2019s power to remove those whom\nthey appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).\n   Fourth, the Court has said that \u201c[o]ur separation-of\npowers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of\none branch\u2019s aggrandizing its power at the expense of\nanother branch.\u201d Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);\naccord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor\nrison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has\nadded that \u201cthe essence of the decision in Myers,\u201d which is\nthe only one of our cases to have struck down a \u201cfor cause\u201d\nremoval restriction, \u201cwas the judgment that the Constitu\ntion prevents Congress from \u2018draw[ing] to itself . . . the\npower to remove.\u2019 \u201d Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMyers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has\n\u201cdrawn\u201d no power to itself to remove the Board members.\nIt has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam\nple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC\nChairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the\nambit of the Court\u2019s most serious constitutional concern.\n   In sum, the Court\u2019s prior cases impose functional\ncriteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond\nthe Court\u2019s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., \u201cone plus\none is greater than one\u201d) our precedent virtually dictates\na holding that the challenged \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is\nconstitutional.\n                              D\n   We should ask one further question. Even if the \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision before us does not itself significantly\ninterfere with the President\u2019s authority or aggrandize\nCongress\u2019 power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a\nbright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a\nseries of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,\nCongress might undercut the President\u2019s central constitu\ntional role? Cf. Strauss 625\u2013626. The answer to this\nquestion is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,\ninsofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.\nAnd in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious\nthan any imaginable harm this \u201cfor cause\u201d provision might\nbring about.\n   The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of its holding\u2014\nan uncertainty that the Court\u2019s opinion both reflects and\ngenerates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule\nmay not apply where an inferior officer \u201cperform[s] adjudi\ncative . . . functions.\u201d Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac\ncounting Board performs adjudicative functions.          See\n24      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsupra, at 17\u201318. What, then, are we to make of the\nCourt\u2019s potential exception? And would such an exception\napply to an administrative law judge who also has impor\ntant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,\ne.g., 8 CFR \u00a71003.9, 34 CFR \u00a781.4 (2009). The Court\nelsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal\nstatutes that provide for \u201cjudicial review of a[n] effort to\nremove\u201d an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But\nwe have previously stated that all officers protected by a\nfor-cause removal provision and later subject to termina\ntion are entitled to \u201cnotice and [a] hearing\u201d in the \u201ccourts,\u201d\nas without such review \u201cthe appointing power\u201d otherwise\n\u201ccould remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it\ndeemed sufficient.\u201d Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.\n419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging\nremoval). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,\nthen, should be given to this hint of an exception?\n   The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may\nnot apply to inferior officers who have a different relation\nship to their appointing agents than the relationship\nbetween the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,\n24\u201326. But the only characteristic of the \u201crelationship\u201d\nbetween the Commission and the Board that the Court\napparently deems relevant is that the relationship in\ncludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at\n23 (\u201cBroad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members\u201d). Why then would\nany different relationship that also includes two layers of\nfor-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.\nPart II\u2013A, supra (describing the Commission\u2019s near abso\nlute control over the Board). In a word, what differences\nare relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding\nin fact applies only where Congress has \u201cenacted an un\nusually high standard\u201d of for-cause removal\u2014and does not\notherwise render two layers of \u201c \u2018ordinary\u2019 \u201d for-cause re\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Compare Parts III\u2013A, III\u2013B,\nIII\u2013C, ante, with Parts II\u2013A, II\u2013B, II\u2013C, supra. And such\na mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying\nthat, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at\nleast at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding\nby its very nature is not \u201ca restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor\u201d one \u201cday and train only.\u201d Smith v. Allwright, 321\nU. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).\n   The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher\nent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its\nrule may not apply to \u201cthe civil service.\u201d Ante, at 26. The\n\u201ccivil service\u201d is defined by statute to include \u201call appoint\nive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,\u201d\nexcluding the military, but including all civil \u201cofficer[s]\u201d up\nto and including those who are subject to Senate confirma\ntion. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil\nservice thus includes many officers indistinguishable from\nthe members of both the Commission and the Accounting\nBoard. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the\n\u201ccompetitive service\u201d\u2014the class within the broader civil\nservice that enjoys the most robust career protection\u2014\n\u201cincludes a vast majority of all the civil officers\u201d in the\nUnited States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5\nU. S. C. \u00a72102(c).\n   But even if I assume that the majority categorically\nexcludes the competitive service from the scope of its new\nrule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu\nsion would be insufficient. This is because the Court\u2019s\n26      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be\ndifferent, simply says that it will not \u201caddres[s]\u201d the mat\nter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot\ndo so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the\nSES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing\nthe inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.\n   The potential list of those whom today\u2019s decision affects\nis yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis\ntrative law judges (ALJs) \u201care all executive officers.\u201d\nFreytag, 501 U.

But the members of the Merit Systems\nProtection Board are themselves protected from removal\nby the President absent good cause. \u00a71202(d).\n   My research reflects that the Federal Government relies\non 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in\nover 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo\nrandum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage\nment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). These ALJs adjudicate\nSocial Security benefits, employment disputes, and other\nmatters highly important to individuals. Does every\nlosing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on\nthe basis that the decision entered against him is uncon\nstitutional?

See Dept. of Defense,\nActive Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),\nonline at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/\nrg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that\nsuch officers may not be removed from office except for\ncause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7629\u2013\n632, 804, 1161, 1181\u20131185. And such officers can gener\nally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see\n\u00a7\u00a7612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career\nprotections.\n  The majority might simply say that the military is\ndifferent. But it will have to explain how it is different. It\nis difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a\nPresident who is the military\u2019s \u201ccommander-in-chief,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a72, cl. 1, with less authority to remove \u201cinferior\u201d\nmilitary \u201cofficers\u201d than to remove comparable civil offi\ncials. See Barron & Lederman, The Commander in Chief\nat the Lowest Ebb\u2014A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.\nL. Rev. 941, 1102\u20131106 (2008) (describing President\u2019s\n\u201csuperintendence prerogative\u201d over the military). Cf. ante,\nat 26\u201327 (not \u201cexpressing any view whatever\u201d as to\nwhether military officers\u2019 authority is now unconstitutional).\n  The majority sees \u201cno reason . . . to address whether\u201d\nany of \u201cthese positions,\u201d \u201cor any others,\u201d might be deemed\nunconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to\nleave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But\nwhat is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all\nthese various officials to be put on hold while the courts of\nappeals determine whether today\u2019s ruling applies to them?\nWill Congress have to act to remove the \u201cfor cause\u201d provi\nsions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142\u2013143. Can the Presi\ndent then restore them via executive order? And, still,\nwhat about the military? A clearer line would help avoid\nthese practical difficulties.\n  The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the\nGovernment\u2019s ability to function while these many ques\n32      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

But\nthis case was not brought by federal officials challenging\ntheir potential removal. It was brought by private indi\nviduals who were subject to regulation \u201c \u2018here-and-now\u2019 \u201d\nand who \u201cobject to the\u201d very \u201cexistence\u201d of the regulators\nthemselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those\nprivate individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person\nsimilarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially\nsubject to the Court\u2019s amorphous new rule will be able to\nbring an \u201cimplied private right of action directly under the\nConstitution\u201d \u201cseeking . . . a declaratory judgment that\u201d\nthe official\u2019s actions are \u201cunconstitutional and an injunc\ntion preventing the\u201d official \u201cfrom exercising [his] powers.\u201d\nAnte, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.\nVelazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of\npreliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of\npowers violation); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S.\n579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Ante, at 7\u201310.\n   Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure\nsuch a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend\ning removal provision. For a court\u2019s \u201cability to devise\n[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly\u201d\nthe \u201cbackground constitutional rules at issue\u201d have been\n\u201carticulated\u201d; severance will be unavailable \u201cin a murky\nconstitutional context,\u201d which is precisely the context that\nthe Court\u2019s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent\nhood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).\nMoreover, \u201cthe touchstone\u201d of the severability analysis \u201cis\nlegislative intent,\u201d id., at 330, and Congress has repeat\nedly expressed its judgment \u201cover the last century that it\nis in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that\nfederal service should depend upon meritorious perform\nance rather than political service,\u201d Civil Service Comm\u2019n,\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 367,\n380\u2013388 (1983) (describing the history of \u201cCongressional\nattention to the problem of politically-motivated removals\u201d).\nAnd so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the\nmany questions the majority\u2019s opinion raises will not only\napply the Court\u2019s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will\nalso determine that the only available remedy to certain\ndouble for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.\n   Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s assertions to the\ncontrary, the potential consequences of today\u2019s holding are\nworrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To\ninterpret the Court\u2019s decision as applicable only in a few\ncircumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbi-\ntrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the\nrule more rational, but destructive.\n                                III\n  One last question: How can the Court simply assume\nwithout deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves\nare removable only \u201cfor cause\u201d? See ante, at 5 (\u201c[W]e\ndecide the case with th[e] understanding\u201d \u201cthat the Com-\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi-\ndent except\u201d for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the\nCommissioners themselves are in fact protected by a \u201cfor\ncause\u201d requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the\nCourt\u2019s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I\nam not aware of any other instance in which the Court has\nsimilarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a\nconstitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that\ndefect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.\nAlabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (\u201cWe\ndo not\u2014we cannot\u2014add provisions to a federal statute . . .\nespecially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would\n[thereby] arise\u201d); The Anaconda v.

Unlike the statutes establish-\ning the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the\nstatute that established the Commission says nothing\nabout removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its\ntext is concerned, the President\u2019s authority to remove the\nCommissioners is no different from his authority to re-\nmove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See\nShurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (\u201cTo take away th[e] power of\nremoval . . . would require very clear and explicit lan-\nguage. It should not be held to be taken away by mere\ninference or implication\u201d); see also Memorandum from\nDavid J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel\nto the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator\nfor Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.\n23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-\nproject.pdf (\u201c[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide\ntenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .\nsettled principles, may remove . . . without cause\u201d); The\nConstitutional Separation of Powers Between the Presi-\ndent and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)\n(same).\n   Nor is the absence of a \u201cfor cause\u201d provision in the stat-\nute that created the Commission likely to have been inad-\nvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9-\nyear period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby\ncast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all \u201cfor cause\u201d\nremoval provisions, but before it decided Humphrey\u2019s\nExecutor, which removed any doubt in respect to the con-\nstitutionality of making commissioners of independent\nagencies removable only for cause. In other words, Con-\ngress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court\u2019s\nprecedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make\nthe Commissioners removable only for cause.

S. ____ (2010)            35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat 9-year period, Congress created at least three major\nfederal agencies without making any of their officers\nremovable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778d\n(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46\nStat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission with \u201cfor cause\u201d protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a77171). By way of contrast, only one month after\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor was decided, Congress returned to\nits pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in\nstatutes creating independent commissions. See \u00a73, 49\nStat. 451, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7153 (establishing National Labor\nRelations Board with an explicit removal limitation).\n   The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis\nsioners removable \u201cfor cause\u201d does not mean it intended to\ncreate a dependent, rather than an independent agency.\nAgency independence is a function of several different\nfactors, of which \u201cfor cause\u201d protection is only one. Those\nfactors include, inter alia, an agency\u2019s separate (rather\nthan presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its\nseparate litigating authority, its composition as a multi\nmember bipartisan board, the use of the word \u201cindepend\nent\u201d in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political\nenvironment, reflecting tradition and function, that would\nimpose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried\nto remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.\nSee generally Breger & Edles 1135\u20131155.\n   The absence of a \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is thus not fatal to\nagency independence. Indeed, a \u201cCongressional Research\nService official suggests that there are at least 13 \u2018inde\npendent\u2019 agencies without a removal provision in their\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing\ncongressional testimony). But it does draw the majority\u2019s\nrule into further confusion. For not only are we left with\nout a definition of an \u201cinferior officer,\u201d but we are also left\n36      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

If any agency\ndeemed \u201cindependent\u201d will be similarly treated, the scope\nof the majority\u2019s holding is even broader still. See Appen\ndix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).\n   The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute\nbooks a \u201cfor cause removal\u201d phrase that does not appear in\nthe relevant statute and which Congress probably did not\nintend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not\nto uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con\nstruction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but\nits opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is not the habit of the\nCourt to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless\nabsolutely necessary to a decision of the case\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); NLRB v.

In light of the present imprecision, it must either\nnarrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually\nalone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in\nplace a broader rule of decision applicable to many other\n\u201cinferior officers\u201d as well. In doing the latter, it will un\ndermine the President\u2019s authority. And it will create an\nobstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func\ntioning of that workable Government that the Constitu\ntion seeks to create\u2014in provisions this Court is sworn to\nuphold.\n   With respect I dissent.\n38      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Each of these officials is,\nunder any definition\u2014including the Court\u2019s\u2014an inferior\nofficer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause\nremoval. See supra, at 25\u201330.\n   The data are organized into three columns: The first\ncolumn lists the \u201coffice\u201d to which the corresponding official\nis assigned within the respective agency and, where avail\nable, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.\nsupra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307\u2013308; Ger\nmaine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns\nrespectively list the career appointees in each agency who\noccupy \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201creserved\u201d SES positions. A \u201cgen\neral\u201d position is one that could be filled by either a career\nappointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current\n(career) occupant to be replaced.           See 5       U. S. C.\n\u00a73132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be\nfilled by career appointees, \u00a73134(b), \u201cmost General posi\ntions are filled by career appointees,\u201d Plum Book 200. A\n\u201creserved\u201d position, by contrast, must always be filled by a\ncareer appointee. \u00a73132(b)(1). The data for the \u201cgeneral\nposition\u201d column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad\nrennial manual prepared by the congressional committees\nresponsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.\nPositions listed as vacant in that source are not included.\nThe data for the \u201creserved position\u201d column come from a\nlist periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man\nagement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.\n16154\u201316251 (2007); \u00a73132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s size and the temporal lag between the underly\ning sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra\ntive, not exact.\n                           Cite as: 561 U.

Argued December 7, 2009\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was\n  created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-\n  Oxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed\n  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri\n  vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry\u2014such as\n  the New York Stock Exchange\u2014that investigate and discipline their\n  own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi\n  zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive\n  powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au\n  dits public companies under the securities laws must register with\n  the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over\n  sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves\n  tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.\n  The parties agree that the Board is \u201cpart of the Government\u201d for con\n  stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora\n  tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are \u201c \u2018Officers of the\n  United States\u2019 \u201d who \u201cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the\n  laws of the United States,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125\u2013126.\n  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board\n  members at will, but only \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d \u201cin accordance\n  with\u201d specified procedures. \u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also\n  agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re\n  moved by the President except for \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\n  malfeasance in office.\u2019 \u201d Humphrey\u2019s Executor v.

PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza\n    tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,\n    seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon\n    stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its\n    powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened\n    the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board\n    members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis\n    for petitioners\u2019 challenge was that Board members were insulated\n    from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board\n    members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,\n    and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi\n    dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board\u2019s ap\n    pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi\n    cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and\n    consent, or\u2014in the case of \u201cinferior Officers\u201d\u2014by \u201cthe President\n    alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,\u201d\n    Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.\n    The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary\n    judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first\n    agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the\n    dual restraints on Board members\u2019 removal are permissible, and that\n    Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent\n    with the Appointments Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The\n Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag\n grieved party may challenge the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinal order\u201d or \u201crule\u201d\n in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. \u00a778y. The Government reads\n \u00a778y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly\n or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis\n trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju\n risdiction if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju\n dicial review\u201d; if the suit is \u201c \u2018wholly \u201ccollateral\u201d \u2019 to a statute\u2019s review\n provisions\u201d; and if the claims are \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212\u2013213.\n    These considerations point against any limitation on review here.\n Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti\n tioners\u2019 challenge is \u201ccollateral\u201d to any Commission orders or rules\n from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti\n tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti\n tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no \u201cmeaningful\u201d avenue of\n relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a\n sanction in order to test a law\u2019s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v.

Pp. 7\u201310.\n   2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members\ncontravene the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Pp. 10\u201327.\n      (a) The Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he executive Power shall be\nvested in a President of the United States of America.\u201d Art. II, \u00a71,\ncl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower\nthe President to keep executive officers accountable\u2014by removing\nthem from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,\n272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not\nwithout limit. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, this Court held that\nCongress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen\ncies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the\nPresident may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in\nUnited States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of\nprincipal executive officers\u2014themselves responsible to the Presi\ndent\u2014to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not\naddressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten\nure. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the\nPresident\u2019s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa\nrated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The\nPresident\u2014or a subordinate he could remove at will\u2014decided\nwhether the officer\u2019s conduct merited removal under the good-cause\nstandard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re\nmoval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any\ndecision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in\nother tenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014who are not subject to\nthe President\u2019s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re\nmove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com\nmission fully accountable for the Board\u2019s conduct. He can only review\nthe Commissioner\u2019s determination of whether the Act\u2019s rigorous good\ncause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de\ntermination, he is powerless to intervene\u2014unless the determination\nis so unreasonable as to constitute \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance in office.\u2019 \u201d Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, at 620.\n   This arrangement contradicts Article II\u2019s vesting of the executive\npower in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or\nto attribute the Board\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee, the\nPresident is no longer the judge of the Board\u2019s conduct. He can nei\nther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon\nsible for a Board member\u2019s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re\n4          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Such diffusion of\n    power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and\n    effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the\n    blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act\u2019s restrictions are\n    therefore incompatible with the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\n    Pp. 14\u201317.\n         (c) The \u201c \u2018fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven\n    ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing\n    alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. \u201d Bowsher\n    v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act\u2019s multilevel tenure protections\n    provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.\n    Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of\n    fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The\n    Framers created a structure in which \u201c[a] dependence on the people\u201d\n    would be the \u201cprimary controul on the government,\u201d and that de\n    pendence is maintained by giving each branch \u201cthe necessary consti\n    tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the\n    others.\u201d The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key \u201cconstitutional means\u201d\n    vested in the President was \u201cthe power of appointing, overseeing, and\n    controlling those who execute the laws.\u201d 1 Annals of Congress 463.\n    While a government of \u201copposite and rival interests\u201d may sometimes\n    inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n    51, at 349, \u201c[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc\n    tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving\n    liberty.\u201d Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17\u201321.\n         (d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con\n    straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\n    Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of\n    the Commission\u2019s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to\n    avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission\u2019s broad power over Board\n    functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter\n    ing the Board\u2019s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control\n    an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board\n    members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the\n    Commission\u2019s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board\n    may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of\n    the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no\n    tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro\n    managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids\n    any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi\n    nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub\n    stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of\n    good-cause removal.

The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the\nremainder of the statute. Because \u201c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part\nof an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re\nmaining provisions,\u201d Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm\u2019n\nof Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the \u201cnormal rule\u201d is \u201cthat partial . . . in\nvalidation is the required course,\u201d Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\n472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board\u2019s existence does not violate the sepa\nration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by\n\u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric\ntions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains \u201c \u2018fully\noperative as a law,\u2019 \u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,\nand nothing in the Act\u2019s text or historical context makes it \u201cevident\u201d\nthat Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose\nmembers are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to\nfunction as before, but its members may be removed at will by the\nCommission. Pp. 27\u201329.\n   4. The Board\u2019s appointment is consistent with the Appointments\nClause. Pp. 29\u201333.\n      (a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment\nCongress may permissibly vest in a \u201cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\u201d Infe\nrior officers \u201care officers whose work is directed and supervised at\nsome level\u201d by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s\nconsent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662\u2013663. Because\nthe good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and\nvoid, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members\nat will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members\nare therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29\u201330.\n      (b) The Commission is a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d under the Appointments\nClause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi\ncally reserved the question whether a \u201cprincipal agenc[y], such as\u201d\nthe SEC, is a \u201cDepartmen[t].\u201d The Court now adopts the reasoning of\nthe concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that\nthe SEC is such a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d because it is a freestanding compo\nnent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within\nany other such component. This reading is consistent with the com\nmon, near-contemporary definition of a \u201cdepartment\u201d; with the early\npractice of Congress, see \u00a73, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court\u2019s cases,\nwhich have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of\nsuch an establishment. Pp. 30\u201331.\n      (c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cHea[d].\u201d The Commission\u2019s powers are generally\nvested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.

Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n951 (1983). Article II vests \u201c[t]he executive Power . . . in a\nPresident of the United States of America,\u201d who must\n\u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Art. II,\n\u00a71, cl. 1; id., \u00a73. In light of \u201c[t]he impossibility that one\nman should be able to perform all the great business of the\nState,\u201d the Constitution provides for executive officers to\n\u201cassist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties\nof his trust.\u201d 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.\nFitzpatrick ed. 1939).\n  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to\nempower the President to keep these officers account\u00ad\nable\u2014by removing them from office, if necessary. See\ngenerally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).\nThis Court has determined, however, that this authority is\nnot without limit. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStates, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,\nunder certain circumstances, create independent agencies\nrun by principal officers appointed by the President, whom\nthe President may not remove at will but only for good\ncause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483\n(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the\nCourt sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin\u00ad\ncipal executive officers\u2014themselves responsible to the\nPresident\u2014to remove their own inferiors. The parties do\nnot ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we\ndo not do so.\n  We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not\nyet encountered by the Court. The question is whether\nthese separate layers of protection may be combined. May\nthe President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin\u00ad\ncipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to\nremove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer\ndetermines the policy and enforces the laws of the United\nStates?\n  We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is\ncontrary to Article II\u2019s vesting of the executive power in\nthe President. The President cannot \u201ctake Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed\u201d if he cannot oversee the\nfaithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the\nPresident cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than\none level of good-cause protection, even if the President\ndetermines that the officer is neglecting his duties or\ndischarging them improperly. That judgment is instead\ncommitted to another officer, who may or may not agree\nwith the President\u2019s determination, and whom the Presi\u00ad\ndent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees\nwith him. This contravenes the President\u2019s \u201cconstitutional\nobligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.\u201d\nId., at 693.\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Among other measures, the Act introduced\ntighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board\nis composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5\u00ad\nyear terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in\nthe securities industry\u2014such as the New York Stock\nExchange\u2014that investigate and discipline their own\nmembers subject to Commission oversight. Congress\ncreated the Board as a private \u201cnonprofit corporation,\u201d and\nBoard members and employees are not considered Gov\u00ad\nernment \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s]\u201d for statutory purposes.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its\nmembers and employees from the private sector by paying\nsalaries far above the standard Government pay scale.\nSee \u00a7\u00a77211(f)(4), 7219.1\n   Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the\nBoard is a Government-created, Government-appointed\nentity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus\u00ad\ntry. Every accounting firm\u2014both foreign and domestic\u2014\nthat participates in auditing public companies under the\nsecurities laws must register with the Board, pay it an\nannual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.\n\u00a7\u00a77211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is\ncharged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu\u00ad\nrities laws, the Commission\u2019s rules, its own rules, and\nprofessional accounting standards. \u00a7\u00a77215(b)(1), (c)(4). To\nthis end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac\u00ad\ncounting firm\u2019s practice, including hiring and professional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The current salary for the Chairman is $673,000.

The Board inspected the firm,\nreleased a report critical of its auditing procedures, and\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbegan a formal investigation. Beckstead and Watts and\nthe Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of\nwhich the firm is a member, then sued the Board and its\nmembers, seeking (among other things) a declaratory\njudgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an in\u00ad\njunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.\nApp. 71.\n   Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers\nby conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board\nmembers without subjecting them to Presidential control.\nId., at 67\u201368. Petitioners also challenged the Act under\nthe Appointments Clause, which requires \u201cOfficers of the\nUnited States\u201d to be appointed by the President with the\nSenate\u2019s advice and consent. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The Clause\nprovides an exception for \u201cinferior Officers,\u201d whose ap\u00ad\npointment Congress may choose to vest \u201cin the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart\u00ad\nments.\u201d Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC,\npetitioners argued that (1) Board members are not \u201cinfe\u00ad\nrior Officers\u201d who may be appointed by \u201cHeads of Depart\u00ad\nments\u201d; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a \u201cDe\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d; and (3) even if it is, the several\nCommissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its\n\u201cHea[d].\u201d See App. 68\u201370. The United States intervened\nto defend the Act\u2019s constitutionality. Both sides moved for\nsummary judgment; the District Court determined that it\nhad jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to re\u00ad\nspondents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a\u2013117a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 537 F. 3d 667\n(CADC 2008). It agreed that the District Court had juris\u00ad\ndiction over petitioners\u2019 claims. Id., at 671. On the mer\u00ad\nits, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue\nwas \u201ca question of first impression,\u201d as neither that court\nnor this one \u201cha[d] considered a situation where a restric\u00ad\ntion on removal passes through two levels of control.\u201d Id.,\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem\u00ad\nbers\u2019 removal are permissible because they do not \u201crender\nthe President unable to perform his constitutional duties.\u201d\nId., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the\nPresident \u201cdoes not directly select or supervise the Board\u2019s\nmembers,\u201d id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre\u00ad\nhensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s influence over the Commission implies a constitu\u00ad\ntionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at\n682\u2013683. The majority also held that Board members are\ninferior officers subject to the Commission\u2019s direction and\nsupervision, id., at 672\u2013676, and that their appointment is\notherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at\n676\u2013678.\n   Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case\nwas one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that\n\u201cthe double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .\ncombine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control\nover the [Board],\u201d id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also\nargued that Board members are not effectively supervised\nby the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers\nunder the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709\u2013712.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the District Court had juris\u00ad\ndiction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes\nproviding for judicial review of Commission action did not\nprevent the District Court from considering petitioners\u2019\nclaims.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to\nreview any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77217(b)(2)\u2013(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted,\naggrieved parties may challenge \u201ca final order of the\nCommission\u201d or \u201ca rule of the Commission\u201d in a court of\nappeals under \u00a778y, and \u201c[n]o objection . . . may be consid\u00ad\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.\nProvisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review\nunless the \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d displays a \u201cfairly discerni\u00ad\nble\u201d intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue\n\u201care of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within\nth[e] statutory structure.\u201d Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.\nReich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates proce\u00ad\ndures \u201cdesigned to permit agency expertise to be brought\nto bear on particular problems,\u201d those procedures \u201care to\nbe exclusive.\u201d Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v.\nBank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420\n(1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to\nlimit jurisdiction if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose\nall meaningful judicial review\u201d; if the suit is \u201cwholly col\u00ad\nlateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and if the claims\nare \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d Thunder Basin,\nsupra, at 212\u2013213 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThese considerations point against any limitation on\nreview here.\n   We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pur\u00ad\nsue their constitutional claims under the Government\u2019s\ntheory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of\nCommission action, and not every Board action is encapsu\u00ad\nlated in a final Commission order or rule.\n   The Government suggests that petitioners could first\nhave sought Commission review of the Board\u2019s \u201cauditing\nstandards, registration requirements, or other rules.\u201d\nBrief for United States 16. But petitioners object to the\nBoard\u2019s existence, not to any of its auditing standards.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners\u2019 general challenge to the Board is \u201ccollateral\u201d\nto any Commission orders or rules from which review\nmight be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,\nInc., 498 U. S. 479, 491\u2013492 (1991). Requiring petitioners\nto select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd\nprocedure for Congress to choose, especially because only\nnew rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.\nSee 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).\n  Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to\nraise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for\nUnited States 16\u201317. But the investigation of Beckstead\nand Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),\nand an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject\nto judicial review, see \u00a77214(h)(2). So the Government\nproposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such\nas a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu\u00ad\nments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the\nCommission then affirms, the firm will win access to a\ncourt of appeals\u2014and severe punishment should its chal\u00ad\nlenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to \u201cbet\nthe farm . . . by taking the violative action\u201d before \u201ctesting\nthe validity of the law,\u201d MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,\nInc., 549 U. S. 118, 129 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young,\n209 U. S. 123 (1908), and we do not consider this a \u201cmean\u00ad\ningful\u201d avenue of relief. Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212.\n  Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims are also outside the\nCommission\u2019s competence and expertise. In Thunder\nBasin, the petitioner\u2019s primary claims were statutory; \u201cat\nroot . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll\nsquarely within the [agency\u2019s] expertise,\u201d given that the\nagency had \u201cextensive experience\u201d on the issue and had\n\u201crecently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.\u201d Id.,\nat 214\u2013215. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329\nU. S. 287 (1946), on which the Government relies, we\nreserved for the agency fact-bound inquiries that, even if\n10        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

S. 361, 373\n(1974). They are instead standard questions of adminis\u00ad\ntrative law, which the courts are at no disadvantage in\nanswering.\n   We therefore conclude that \u00a778y did not strip the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court of jurisdiction over these claims, which are\nproperly presented for our review.2\n                          III\n  We hold that the dual for-cause limitations on the re\u00ad\nmoval of Board members contravene the Constitution\u2019s\nseparation of powers.\n                          A\n  The Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he executive Power\nshall be vested in a President of the United States of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Government asserts that \u201cpetitioners have not pointed to any\n\ncase in which this Court has recognized an implied private right of\naction directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action\nunder the Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers principles.\u201d\nBrief for United States 22. The Government does not appear to dispute\nsuch a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particu\u00ad\nlar constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g., Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 74 (2001) (equitable relief \u201chas\nlong been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from\nacting unconstitutionally\u201d); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (\u201c[I]t\nis established practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdiction of\nfederal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights safeguarded by the\nConstitution\u201d); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 149, 165, 167\n(1908). If the Government\u2019s point is that an Appointments Clause or\nseparation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every\nother constitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority\nwhy that might be so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

As Madison stated on the floor\nof the First Congress, \u201cif any power whatsoever is in its\nnature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing,\nand controlling those who execute the laws.\u201d 1 Annals of\nCong. 463 (1789).\n   The removal of executive officers was discussed exten\u00ad\nsively in Congress when the first executive departments\nwere created. The view that \u201cprevailed, as most consonant\nto the text of the Constitution\u201d and \u201cto the requisite re\u00ad\nsponsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,\u201d\nwas that the executive power included a power to oversee\nexecutive officers through removal; because that tradi\u00ad\ntional executive power was not \u201cexpressly taken away, it\nremained with the President.\u201d Letter from James Madi\u00ad\nson to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary\nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). \u201cThis\nDecision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty\nevidence of the Constitution\u2019s meaning since many of the\nMembers of the First Congress had taken part in framing\nthat instrument.\u201d Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723\u2013\n724 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).

United States reaffirmed\nthe principle that Article II confers on the President \u201cthe\ngeneral administrative control of those executing the\nlaws.\u201d 272 U. S., at 164. It is his responsibility to take\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops\nwith the President, in Harry Truman\u2019s famous phrase. As\nwe explained in Myers, the President therefore must have\nsome \u201cpower of removing those for whom he can not con\u00ad\ntinue to be responsible.\u201d Id., at 117.\n   Nearly a decade later in Humphrey\u2019s Executor, this\nCourt held that Myers did not prevent Congress from\nconferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of\n12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncertain independent agencies. That case concerned the\nmembers of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7\u00ad\nyear terms and could not be removed by the President\nexcept for \u201c \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\noffice.\u2019 \u201d 295 U. S., at 620 (quoting 15 U. S. C. \u00a741). The\nCourt distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers\nconcerned \u201can officer [who] is merely one of the units in\nthe executive department and, hence, inherently subject to\nthe exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief\nExecutive, whose subordinate and aid he is.\u201d 295 U. S., at\n627. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as\n\u201cquasi-legislative and quasi-judicial\u201d rather than \u201cpurely\nexecutive,\u201d and held that Congress could require it \u201cto act\n. . . independently of executive control.\u201d Id., at 627\u2013629.\nBecause \u201cone who holds his office only during the pleasure\nof another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an atti\u00ad\ntude of independence against the latter\u2019s will,\u201d the Court\nheld that Congress had power to \u201cfix the period during\nwhich [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to\nforbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.\u201d\nId., at 629.\n    Humphrey\u2019s Executor did not address the removal of\ninferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in\nheads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily\nthe department head, rather than the President, who\nenjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119,\n127; Hennen, supra, at 259\u2013260. This Court has upheld\nfor-cause limitations on that power as well.\n    In Perkins, a naval cadet-engineer was honorably dis\u00ad\ncharged from the Navy because his services were no longer\nrequired. 116 U.

S., at 485. Because Perkins had\nnot been \u201c \u2018dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the\nsentence of a court-martial,\u2019 \u201d the Court agreed that he was\n\u201c \u2018still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.3\n    We again considered the status of inferior officers in\nMorrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government\nAct, which provided for an independent counsel to investi\u00ad\ngate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The\ncounsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full\npowers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attor\u00ad\nney General only \u201c \u2018for good cause.\u2019 \u201d 487 U. S., at 663\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7596(a)(1)). We recognized that the\nindependent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,\nrather than \u201c \u2018quasi-legislative\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018quasi-judicial,\u2019 \u201d but\nwe stated as \u201cour present considered view\u201d that Congress\nhad power to impose good-cause restrictions on her re\u00ad\nmoval. 487 U.

Under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a\n\nprincipal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. \u00a7415, and\nthe Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his\nremoval. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. \u00a71767. This requirement\nwas widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally\nregarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,\n1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167\u2013\n168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986).\nPerkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in\ncombination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The\nCourt of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only\nthe authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthose circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.\nMorrison did not, however, address the consequences of\nmore than one level of good-cause tenure\u2014leaving the\nissue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, \u201ca\nquestion of first impression\u201d in this Court. 537 F. 3d, at\n679; see id., at 698 (dissenting opinion).\n                              B\n   As explained, we have previously upheld limited restric\u00ad\ntions on the President\u2019s removal power. In those cases,\nhowever, only one level of protected tenure separated the\nPresident from an officer exercising executive power. It\nwas the President\u2014or a subordinate he could remove at\nwill\u2014who decided whether the officer\u2019s conduct merited\nremoval under the good-cause standard.\n   The Act before us does something quite different. It not\nonly protects Board members from removal except for good\ncause, but withdraws from the President any decision on\nwhether that good cause exists. That decision is vested\ninstead in other tenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014\nnone of whom is subject to the President\u2019s direct control.\nThe result is a Board that is not accountable to the Presi\u00ad\ndent, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.\n   The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.\nWithout a layer of insulation between the Commission and\nthe Board, the Commission could remove a Board member\nat any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for\nwhat the Board does. The President could then hold the\nCommission to account for its supervision of the Board, to\nthe same extent that he may hold the Commission to\naccount for everything else it does.\n   A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of\nthe President\u2019s review.

They are only responsible for their own determi\u00ad\nnation of whether the Act\u2019s rigorous good-cause standard\nis met. And even if the President disagrees with their\ndetermination, he is powerless to intervene\u2014unless that\ndetermination is so unreasonable as to constitute \u201cineffi\u00ad\nciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   This novel structure does not merely add to the Board\u2019s\nindependence, but transforms it. Neither the President,\nnor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer\nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full\ncontrol over the Board. The President is stripped of the\npower our precedents have preserved, and his ability to\nexecute the laws\u2014by holding his subordinates accountable\nfor their conduct\u2014is impaired.\n   That arrangement is contrary to Article II\u2019s vesting of\nthe executive power in the President. Without the ability\nto oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board\u2019s failings to\nthose whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the\njudge of the Board\u2019s conduct. He is not the one who de\u00ad\ncides whether Board members are abusing their offices or\nneglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the\nlaws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a\nBoard member\u2019s breach of faith. This violates the basic\nprinciple that the President \u201ccannot delegate ultimate\nresponsibility or the active obligation to supervise that\ngoes with it,\u201d because Article II \u201cmakes a single President\nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\u201d\nClinton v.

If Congress can shelter the\nbureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why\nnot a third? At oral argument, the Government was un\u00ad\nwilling to concede that even five layers between the Presi\u00ad\ndent and the Board would be too many. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n47\u201348. The officers of such an agency\u2014safely encased\nwithin a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections\u2014would be\nimmune from Presidential oversight, even as they exer\u00ad\ncised power in the people\u2019s name.\n   Perhaps an individual President might find advantages\nin tying his own hands. But the separation of powers does\nnot depend on the views of individual Presidents, see\nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879\u2013880 (1991),\nnor on whether \u201cthe encroached-upon branch approves the\nencroachment,\u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992). The President can always choose to restrain\nhimself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot,\nhowever, choose to bind his successors by diminishing\ntheir powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his\nchoices by pretending that they are not his own.\n   The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of\naccountability. The people do not vote for the \u201cOfficers of\nthe United States.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.

Without a second layer of protection, the Commission has no\nexcuse for retaining an officer who is not faithfully executing the law.\nWith the second layer in place, the Commission can shield its decision\nfrom Presidential review by finding that good cause is absent\u2014a\nfinding that, given the Commission\u2019s own protected tenure, the Presi\u00ad\ndent cannot easily overturn. The dissent describes this conflict merely\nas one of four possible \u201cscenarios,\u201d see post, at 12\u201313, but it is the\ncentral issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the\nPresident finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and\na statute prevents him from doing so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Our\nConstitution was adopted to enable the people to govern\nthemselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of\nthe Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and\ntouches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the\nconcern that it may slip from the Executive\u2019s control, and\nthus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab\u00ad\nsent from the dissent\u2019s paean to the administrative state.\n    For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of\nremoval as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s \u201cpower to get something done\u201d more often depends\non \u201cwho controls the agency\u2019s budget requests and fund\u00ad\ning, the relationships between one agency or department\nand another, . . . purely political factors (including Con\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Neither\nrespondents nor the dissent explains why the Board\u2019s\ntask, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer\nof insulation from the President\u2014or, for that matter, why\nonly two.

See Brief for United States 47. It contends,\nhowever, that the removal restrictions at issue here do\nnot.\n  To begin with, the Government argues that the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s removal power over the Board is \u201cbroad,\u201d and\ncould be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid\ninvalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB\nBrief 22\u201323. But the Government does not contend that\nsimple disagreement with the Board\u2019s policies or priorities\ncould constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for its removal. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 41\u201343, 45\u201346. Nor do our precedents suggest as\nmuch.

The\nremoval restrictions set forth in the statute mean what\nthey say.\n   Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat\nto executive control than an \u201cordinary\u201d dual for-cause\nstandard.

The\nAct does not even give the Commission power to fire Board\nmembers for violations of other laws that do not relate to\nthe Act, the securities laws, or the Board\u2019s authority. The\nPresident might have less than full confidence in, say, a\nBoard member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery\nis not listed among the grounds for removal under\n\u00a77217(d)(3).7\n   The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board\nmember may be removed was drawn from statutes con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The Government implausibly argues that \u00a77217(d)(3) \u201cdoes not ex\u00ad\n\npressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,\u201d and that\n\u201cthe Act could be construed to permit other grounds.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 51, n. 19.

But altering the budget or powers of an\nagency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe\u00ad\nrior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to\nsupervise individual members if it must destroy the Board\nin order to fix it.\n   Even if Commission power over Board activities could\nsubstitute for authority over its members, we would still\nreject respondents\u2019 premise that the Commission\u2019s power\nin this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is\nempowered to take significant enforcement actions, and\ndoes so largely independently of the Commission. See\nsupra, at 3\u20134.

See, e.g., PCAOB Brief\n43. \tAs Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:\n     \u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of the severe con\u00ad\n     stitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of his\u00ad\n     torical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority\n     opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as in\u00ad\n     tervenor has located any historical analogues for this\n     novel structure. They have not identified any inde\u00ad\n     pendent agency other than the PCAOB that is ap\u00ad\n     pointed by and removable only for cause by another\n     independent agency.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 669.\n   The dissent here suggests that other such positions\nmight exist, and complains that we do not resolve their\nstatus in this opinion. Post, at 23\u201331. The dissent itself,\nhowever, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal\nGovernment, see post, at 7\u20138, and those features discour\u00ad\nage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed\nnor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support\nits premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies\nare similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 28\u201331.\n   For example, many civil servants within independent\nagencies would not qualify as \u201cOfficers of the United\nStates,\u201d who \u201cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to\nthe laws of the United States,\u201d Buckley, 424 U.

PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee supra, at 4; see also Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. We do not decide\nthe status of other Government employees, nor do we\ndecide whether \u201clesser functionaries subordinate to offi\u00ad\ncers of the United States\u201d must be subject to the same sort\nof control as those who exercise \u201csignificant authority\npursuant to the laws.\u201d Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.\n   Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy\nthe same significant and unusual protections from Presi\u00ad\ndential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or\npolicymaking positions in government may be excepted\nfrom the competitive service to ensure Presidential con\u00ad\ntrol, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and\nmembers of the Senior Executive Service may be reas\u00ad\nsigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies\nmay be excluded from that Service by the President), see,\ne.g., \u00a7\u00a73132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.\n\u00a72302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority\nis not before us, any such authority is of course wholly\nabsent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,\ntherefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what\nis colloquially known as the civil service system within\nindependent agencies.10\n   Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests\nthat today\u2019s opinion might increase the President\u2019s author\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset\n\nof independent agency employees who serve as administrative law\njudges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law\njudges are necessarily \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d is disputed. See,\ne.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem\u00ad\nbers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform\nadjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see\n\u00a7\u00a7554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov\u00ad\nernment below refused to identify either \u201ccivil service tenure-protected\nemployees in independent agencies\u201d or administrative law judges as\n\u201cprecedent for the PCAOB.\u201d 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07\u20135127\n(CADC), pp. 32, 37\u201338, 42.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Without expressing any\nview whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough\nto note that we see little analogy between our Nation\u2019s\narmed services and the Public Company Accounting Over\u00ad\nsight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi\u00ad\ndential control through the chain of command and through\nthe President\u2019s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,\n\u00a72, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7162, 164(g). The President\nand his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry\nor courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor\nperformance by those officers. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7822(a)(1),\n823(a)(1), 892(3), 933\u2013934, 1181\u20131185. Here, by contrast,\nthe President has no authority to initiate a Board mem\u00ad\nber\u2019s removal for cause.\n   There is no reason for us to address whether these\npositions identified by the dissent, or any others not at\nissue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the\nPresident\u2019s constitutional authority. Nor is there any\nsubstance to the dissent\u2019s concern that the \u201cwork of all\nthese various officials\u201d will \u201cbe put on hold.\u201d Post, at 31.\nAs the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting\ncertain officers to a single level of insulation from the\nPresident affects the conditions under which those officers\nmight some day be removed, and would have no effect,\nabsent a congressional determination to the contrary, on\nthe validity of any officer\u2019s continuance in office. The only\nissue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the\nPresident of adequate control over the Board, which is the\nregulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement\nauthority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it\ncannot.\n                            IV\n  Petitioners\u2019 complaint argued that the Board\u2019s \u201cfreedom\nfrom Presidential oversight and control\u201d rendered it \u201cand\nall power and authority exercised by it\u201d in violation of the\n28      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nConstitution. App. 46. We reject such a broad holding.\nInstead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti\u00ad\ntutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain\u00ad\nder of the statute.\n   \u201cGenerally speaking, when confronting a constitutional\nflaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob\u00ad\nlem,\u201d severing any \u201cproblematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.\u201d       Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328\u2013329 (2006). Be\u00ad\ncause \u201c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not\nnecessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining\nprovisions,\u201d Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation\nComm\u2019n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the \u201cnormal\nrule\u201d is \u201cthat partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the\nrequired course,\u201d Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472\nU. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners\u2019\nAppointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the\nexistence of the Board does not violate the separation of\npowers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed\nby \u00a7\u00a77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional\ndefault rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint\u00ad\nment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,\nn. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13\nPet., at 259\u2013260. Concluding that the removal restrictions\nare invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will, and leaves the President separated from Board\nmembers by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The\nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board\u2019s ac\u00ad\ntions, which are no less subject than the Commission\u2019s\nown functions to Presidential oversight.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains \u201c \u2018fully operative as a\nlaw\u2019 \u201d with these tenure restrictions excised. New York,\n505 U. S., at 186 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,\n480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its\nremaining provisions \u201c[u]nless it is evident that the Legis\u00ad\nlature would not have enacted those provisions . . . inde\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Though this inquiry can some\u00ad\ntimes be \u201celusive,\u201d Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer\nhere seems clear: The remaining provisions are not \u201cinca\u00ad\npable of functioning independently,\u201d Alaska Airlines, 480\nU. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute\u2019s text or historical\ncontext makes it \u201cevident\u201d that Congress, faced with the\nlimitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre\u00ad\nferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are\nremovable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.\n  It is true that the language providing for good-cause\nremoval is only one of a number of statutory provisions\nthat, working together, produce a constitutional violation.\nIn theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi\u00ad\ncient number of the Board\u2019s responsibilities so that its\nmembers would no longer be \u201cOfficers of the United\nStates.\u201d Or we could restrict the Board\u2019s enforcement\npowers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory\npanel. Or the Board members could in future be made\nremovable by the President, for good cause or at will. But\nsuch editorial freedom\u2014far more extensive than our hold\u00ad\ning today\u2014belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\nCongress of course remains free to pursue any of these\noptions going forward.\n                             V\n  Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board\nunder the Appointments Clause. None has merit.\n  First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi\u00ad\npal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the\nSenate\u2019s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U. S. 651, 662\u2013663 (1997), that\n\u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether\nhe has a superior,\u201d and that \u201c \u2018inferior officers\u2019 are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level\u201d by\nother officers appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsent. In particular, we noted that \u201c[t]he power to\nremove officers\u201d at will and without cause \u201cis a powerful\ntool for control\u201d of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained\nabove, the statutory restrictions on the Commission\u2019s\npower to remove Board members are unconstitutional and\nvoid. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,\nunder the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove\nBoard members at will, and given the Commission\u2019s other\noversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding\nthat under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi\u00ad\ncers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in\na \u201cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\u201d\n   But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a \u201cDe\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d like the \u201cExecutive departments\u201d (e.g., State,\nTreasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. \u00a7101. In Freytag,\n501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques\u00ad\ntion whether a \u201cprincipal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi\u00ad\nties and Exchange Commission,\u201d is a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d\nunder the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,\nwould have concluded that the Commission is indeed such\na \u201cDepartmen[t],\u201d see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), because it is a \u201cfree\u00ad\nstanding, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,\u201d\nid., at 915.\n   Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those\nentities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief\nfor United States 37\u201339; PCAOB Brief 30\u201333, and we do.\nRespondents\u2019 reading of the Appointments Clause is con\u00ad\nsistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of\na \u201cdepartment\u201d as a \u201cseparate allotment or part of busi\u00ad\nness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are\nallotted to a particular person.\u201d 1 N. Webster, American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995\nfacsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice\nof Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster\nGeneral to appoint \u201can assistant, and deputy postmasters,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat all places where such shall be found necessary,\u201d \u00a73, 1\nStat. 234\u2014thus treating him as the \u201cHea[d] of [a] De\u00ad\npartmen[t]\u201d without the title of Secretary or any role in\nthe President\u2019s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our\nprior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment\nmade by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,\nsupra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,\n515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511\n(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo\u00ad\nnent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con\u00ad\ntained within any other such component, it constitutes a\n\u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d for the purposes of the Appointments\nClause.11\n   But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the\nfull Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board\nmembers, because only the Chairman of the Commission\nis the Commission\u2019s \u201cHea[d].\u201d12 The Commission\u2019s powers,\nhowever, are generally vested in the Commissioners\njointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a777s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to\nthe Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive\nfunctions subject to the full Commission\u2019s policies. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an \u201cexecu\u00ad\n\ntive Departmen[t]\u201d under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 1, or\nunder Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886\u2013887 (1991).\n   12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this\n\nclaim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the\nChairman\u2019s objection, and so petitioners\u2019 injuries are not fairly trace\u00ad\nable to an invalid appointment. See Defendants\u2019 Memorandum of\nPoints and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\nin Civil Action No. 1:06\u2013cv\u201300217\u2013JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42\u201343; Brief\nfor Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07\u20135127 (CADC), pp. 32\u201333. We\ncannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the\nsame appointments acting alone; and petitioners\u2019 standing does not\nrequire precise proof of what the Board\u2019s policies might have been in\nthat counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n533 (1962) (plurality opinion).\n32        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The\nChairman is also appointed from among the Commission\u00ad\ners by the President alone, id., \u00a73, at 1266, which means\nthat he cannot be regarded as \u201cthe head of an agency\u201d for\npurposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S.

The Appointments Clause neces\u00ad\nsarily contemplates collective appointments by the \u201cCourts\nof Law,\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,\nappoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 5; id., \u00a73,\ncl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi\u00ad\nnation of principal officers in the President to avoid the\nperceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal\nno similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose\nappointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul\u00ad\ntimember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap\u00ad\npointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.\nSee Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of\n1923, ch. 265, \u00a72, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining \u201cthe head of the\ndepartment\u201d to mean \u201cthe officer or group of officers . . .\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Petitionerscontend that finding the Commission to be the head will\ninvalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,\nsuch as those of the \u201cheads of major [SEC] administrative units.\u201d\nReorg.

It argues that granting\nthe \u201cinferior officer[s]\u201d on the Accounting Board \u201cmore\nthan one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the\nPresident\u2019s \u2018constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful\nexecution of the laws.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2.

But in my view the statute does not significantly\ninterfere with the President\u2019s \u201cexecutive Power.\u201d Art. II,\n\u00a71. It violates no separation-of-powers principle.

On the one hand,\nCongress has broad power to enact statutes \u201cnecessary\nand proper\u201d to the exercise of its specifically enumerated\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

As Chief Jus\ntice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers\u2019 efforts\nto create a Constitution that would \u201cendure for ages to\ncome.\u201d McCulloch v.

Such \u201cimmutable\nrules\u201d would deprive the Government of the needed flexi\nbility to respond to future \u201cexigencies which, if foreseen at\nall, must have been seen dimly.\u201d Ibid. Thus the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority\nto \u201ccreate\u201d governmental \u201c \u2018offices\u2019 \u201d and to structure those\noffices \u201cas it chooses.\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138\n(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355\n(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the\npast century to create numerous federal agencies in re\nsponse to \u201cvarious crises of human affairs\u201d as they have\narisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.\nWong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36\u201337 (1950).\n   On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,\nand III of the Constitution separately and respectively\nvest \u201call legislative Powers\u201d in Congress, the \u201cexecutive\nPower\u201d in the President, and the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d in the\nSupreme Court (and such \u201cinferior Courts as Congress\nmay from time to time ordain and establish\u201d). In doing so,\nthese provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers\nprinciple. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341\u2013\n342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction\nin Article II, \u00a73 that the President \u201cshall take Care that\nthe Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d limits Congress\u2019 power to\nstructure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis\nsioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

S. 833, 859\u2013860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held\nthat the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the\nPresident the authority to dismiss certain Executive\nBranch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.\n52 (1926).\n   But neither of these two principles is absolute in its\napplication to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper\nClause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu\ntive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the\nPresident. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin\nciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove\nany and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,\ndepending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or\nits subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent\nwith the Constitution, limit the President\u2019s authority to\nremove an officer from his post. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor\nv. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).\nAnd we must here decide whether the circumstances\nsurrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.\n   In answering the question presented, we cannot look to\nmore specific constitutional text, such as the text of the\nAppointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon\nwhich the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers\ncases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at\n124\u2013125. That is because, with the exception of the gen\neral \u201cvesting\u201d and \u201ctake care\u201d language, the Constitution\nis completely \u201csilent with respect to the power of removal\nfrom office.\u201d Ex parte Hennen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1839); see\nalso Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cThere is, of course, no provision in the Constitution\nstating who may remove executive officers . . . \u201d).\n   Nor does history offer significant help.

Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin\nued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should\nbe drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also\nabout the nature of the original disagreement.

Fisher, President\nand Congress: Power and Policy 86\u201389 (1972).\n   Nor does this Court\u2019s precedent fully answer the ques\ntion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the\nprovision in dispute. See Part II\u2013C, infra. In Myers,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, the Court invalidated\u2014for the first and only time\u2014\na congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim\nited the President\u2019s authority to remove an Executive\nBranch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly\ndisapproved most of Myers\u2019 broad reasoning. See Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626\u2013627, overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352\n(1958) (stating that Humphrey\u2019s Executor \u201cexplicitly \u2018dis\napproved\u2019 \u201d of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,\nthe Court has since said that \u201cthe essence of the decision\nin Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents\nCongress from \u2018draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove\nor the right to participate in the exercise of that power.\u2019 \u201d\nMorrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea\nture of the statute\u2014a feature that would aggrandize the\npower of Congress\u2014is not present here. Congress has not\ngranted itself any role in removing the members of the\nAccounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (\u201csepara\ntion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the\ndanger of one branch\u2019s aggrandizing its power at the\nexpense of another branch\u201d (emphasis added)); Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com\npare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress\ngranted itself removal authority over Executive Branch\nofficial), with Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, (upholding\nstatute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,\nsupra (same); Morrison, supra (same).\n   In short, the question presented lies at the intersection\nof two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional\nprinciples. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent\nprovides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527\nU. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that\n\u201cthis Court\u201d is \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d when \u201cit deals with\njudge-made constitutional law\u201d that lacks \u201croots in the\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53\n(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the\nCourt said that \u201cregard must be had, as in other cases\nwhere constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat\nters of form, but to the substance of what is required.\u201d\nThe Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in\nMorrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court\nmust look \u201c \u2018beyond form to the substance of what\u2019 Con\ngress has done\u201d); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689\u2013690 (\u201cThe\nanalysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to\ndefine rigid categories of those officials who may or may\nnot be removed at will by the President,\u201d but rather asks\nwhether, given the \u201cfunctions of the officials in question,\u201d\na removal provision \u201cinterfere[s] with the President\u2019s\nexercise of the \u2018executive power\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). The\nCourt has thereby written into law Justice Jackson\u2019s wise\nperception that \u201cthe Constitution . . . contemplates that\npractice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka\nble government.\u201d Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). See also ibid. (\u201cThe actual art of gov\nerning under our Constitution does not and cannot con\nform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its\nbranches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles\ntorn from context\u201d).\n   It is not surprising that the Court in these circum\nstances has looked to function and context, and not to\nbright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies\nthe intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow\nthe three coordinate branches, including this Court, to\nexercise practical judgment in response to changing condi\ntions and \u201cexigencies,\u201d which at the time of the founding\ncould be seen only \u201cdimly,\u201d and perhaps not at all.\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.\n   For another, a functional approach permits Congress\nand the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory\nlaw to changing circumstances. That is why the \u201cpowers\nconferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu\ntion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for\nthe expansion of the Federal Government\u2019s role\u201d over time.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).\nIndeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found\ning consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu\nlation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the\nFederal Personnel System, in The Federal Government\nService 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,\nCensus Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:\nColonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,\nthe Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work\ners who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people\nliving in a society characterized by rapid technological,\neconomic, and social change. See Office of Management\nand Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.\nGovernment, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).\n   Federal statutes now require or permit Government\nofficials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not\nonly foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of\nsuch subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,\npharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,\nelectricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru\nments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,\nthe environment, fair employment practices, consumer\nprotection and much else besides. Those statutes create a\nhost of different organizational structures. Sometimes\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

C. \u00a75221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they\ndelegate authority to an independent commission or board,\ne.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a74404(b); 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994; sometimes they\nplace authority directly in the hands of a single senior\nadministrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a7657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,\noffice, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a74048;\nsometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency\ntask groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7593\u2013594; 50 U. S. C. \u00a7402\n(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis\nsions or advisory committees made up of members of more\nthan one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. \u00a742(a); 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. \u00a71975; sometimes\nthey divide it among groups of departments, commissions,\nbureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a79902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. \u00a7136i\u20131(g); and\nsometimes they permit state or local governments to\nparticipate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a72009aa\u20131(a). Statutes\nsimilarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers\u2014\nfor example, the power to make rules, develop informal\npractices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant\nlicenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.\nSee generally 5 U. S. C. \u00a7500 et seq.\n   The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov\nerning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast\nnumbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,\ntheir execution or administration through the work of\nadministrators organized within many different kinds of\nadministrative structures, exercising different kinds of\nadministrative authority, to achieve their legislatively\nmandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov\nernment\u2019s work, it is not surprising that administrative\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nunits come in many different shapes and sizes.\n   The functional approach required by our precedents\nrecognizes this administrative complexity and, more im\nportantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power\noperates within this context\u2014and the various ways in\nwhich a removal provision might affect that power. As\nhuman beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself\nto the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens\u2019 song, some\ntimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve\na broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit\nments\u2014such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly\nbe changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish\nment of independent administrative institutions\u2014hold the\npotential to empower precisely because of their ability to\nconstrain. If the President seeks to regulate through\nimpartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator\nfrom removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And\nto free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal\nwithout cause can similarly help create legitimacy with\nrespect to that official\u2019s regulatory actions by helping to\ninsulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political\npressure.\n   Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of\nelementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a\nPresident\u2019s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule\nthat takes power from the President\u2019s opponents may\nstrengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a\nfunctionally neutral independent authority? In that case,\nit is difficult to predict how the President\u2019s power is af\nfected in the abstract.\n   These practical reasons not only support our precedents\u2019\ndetermination that cases such as this should examine the\nspecific functions and context at issue; they also indicate\nthat judges should hesitate before second-guessing a \u201cfor\ncause\u201d decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,\nChadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a \u201cpresumption that\n10      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Compared to\nCongress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an\ninferior understanding of the realities of administration,\nand the manner in which power, including and most espe\ncially political power, operates in context.\n  There is no indication that the two comparatively more\nexpert branches were divided in their support for the \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em\nbodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in\nthe House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the\nSenate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation\nof the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in\nboth bodies without anyone finding in its structure any\nconstitutional problem.

The\nPresident signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a\nsigning statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the\nAct but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.\nSee President\u2019s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres.

In practical terms no \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision can, in isolation, define the full measure\nof executive power. This is because a legislative decision\nto place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the\nSecretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the\nway in which the statute defines the scope of the power\nthe relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to\nwho controls the agency\u2019s budget requests and funding,\nthe relationships between one agency or department and\nanother, as well as more purely political factors (including\nCongress\u2019 ability to assert influence) are more likely to\naffect the President\u2019s power to get something done. That\nis why President Truman complained that \u201c \u2018the powers of\nthe President amount to\u2019 \u201d bringing \u201c \u2018people in and try[ing]\nto persuade them to do what they ought to do without\npersuasion.\u2019 \u201d C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154\n(2d rev. ed. 1960).

See Bruff, Bringing the Inde\npendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.\nEn Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.\norg/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf\n(noting that \u201cPresidents do not test the limits of their\npower by removing commissioners . . . \u201d); Lessig & Sun\nstein 110\u2013112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to\ndefine what constitutes \u201ccause\u201d because Presidents rarely\ntest removal provisions).\n   But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we\nshould still conclude that the \u201cfor cause\u201d restriction before\nus will not restrict presidential power significantly. For\none thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi\ndent\u2019s power, but the power of an already independent\nagency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when\nit identifies its central constitutional problem: According\nto the Court, the President \u201cis powerless to intervene\u201d if he\nhas determined that the Board members\u2019 \u201cconduct merit[s]\nremoval\u201d because \u201c[t]hat decision is vested instead in other\ntenured officers\u2014the Commissioners\u2014none of whom is\nsubject to the President\u2019s direct control.\u201d Ante, at 14\u201315.\nBut so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from\nremoving the Commissioners except for cause (as the\nmajority assumes), nullifying the Commission\u2019s power to\nremove Board members only for cause will not resolve the\nproblem the Court has identified: The President will still\nbe \u201cpowerless to intervene\u201d by removing the Board mem\nbers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.\n   In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of\n\u201cfor cause\u201d protection\u2014Layer One insulating the Commis\nsioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the\nBoard from the Commissioners\u2014impose any more serious\nlimitation upon the President\u2019s powers than one layer.\nConsider the four scenarios that might arise:\n    1. The President and the Commission both want to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n        keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is\n        relevant.\n    2. The President and the Commission both want to\n        dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them\n        both from doing so without cause. The President\u2019s\n        ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is\n        irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in\n        agreement.\n    3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,\n        but the Commission wants to keep the member.\n        Layer One allows the Commission to make that de\n        termination notwithstanding the President\u2019s con\n        trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the\n        Commission does not seek to remove the Board\n        member.\n    4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but\n        the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem\n        ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it\n        hinders the Commission\u2019s ability to dismiss a Board\n        member whom the President wants to keep in\n        place.\n  Thus, the majority\u2019s decision to eliminate only Layer\nTwo accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a\nremoval restriction\u2019s effect upon presidential power de\npends not on the presence of a \u201cdouble-layer\u201d of for-cause\nremoval, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real\nworld nature of the President\u2019s relationship with the\nCommission. If the President confronts a Commission\nthat seeks to resist his policy preferences\u2014a distinct pos\nsibility when, as here, a Commission\u2019s membership must\nreflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778d(a)\u2014the\nrestriction on the Commission\u2019s ability to remove a Board\nmember is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may\nactually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the\nPresident faces a Commission that seeks to implement his\npolicy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndent and Commission see eye to eye.\n  In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates\ntwo alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission\nand the President both want to remove a Board member,\nbut have varying judgments as to whether they have good\n\u201ccause\u201d to do so\u2014i.e., the President and the Commission\nboth conclude that a Board member should be removed,\nbut disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they\nhave both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14\u201315. In the\nsecond, the President wants to remove a Board member\nand the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its\nfreedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the\nPresident (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while\napparently telling the President that it agrees with him\nand would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer\nTwo as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to pursue its actual aims\u2014an excuse\nwhich, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.\n  Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not\nknow if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their\nlogical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And\nthe fact that, with respect to the President\u2019s power, the\ndouble layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,\nsometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over\nall effect is at most indeterminate.\n  But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and\nview the removal provision at issue in the context of the\nentire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily\napparent. That is because the statute provides the Com\nmission with full authority and virtually comprehensive\ncontrol over all of the Board\u2019s functions. Those who cre\nated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc\nture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod\nies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange and other similar self\nregulating organizations. See generally Brief for Former\nChairmen of the SEC as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations\u2014\nwhich rely on private financing and on officers drawn from\nthe private sector\u2014exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory\nauthority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed\n\u201centirely derivative\u201d of, the SEC. See National Assn. of\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC\n2005).\n   Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac\ncounting Board the power to adopt rules and standards\n\u201crelating to the preparation of audit reports\u201d; to adjudicate\ndisciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that\nfail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en\ngage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec\ntions of accounting firms registered as the law requires\nand investigations to monitor compliance with the rules\nand related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77211\u2013\n7216. But, at the same time,\n    \u2022\t No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and\n        until the Commission approves it, \u00a77217(b)(2);\n    \u2022\t The Commission may \u201cabrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to\u201d\n        any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the\n        Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission\u2019s\n        view, doing so \u201cfurther[s] the purposes\u201d of the securi\n        ties and accounting-oversight laws, \u00a77217(b)(5);\n    \u2022\t The Commission may review any sanction the\n        Board imposes and \u201cenhance, modify, cancel, re\n        duce, or require the remission of\u201d that sanction if it\n        find\u2019s the Board\u2019s action not \u201cappropriate,\u201d\n        \u00a7\u00a77215(e), 7217(c)(3);\n    \u2022\t The Commission may promulgate rules restricting\n        or directing the Accounting Board\u2019s conduct of all\n        inspections    and     investigations,   \u00a7\u00a77211(c)(3),\n        7214(h), 7215(b)(1)\u2013(4);\n    \u2022\t The Commission may itself initiate any investigation\n        or promulgate any rule within the Accounting\n        Board\u2019s purview, \u00a77202, and may also remove any\n16      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Ante, at 23\u201324. On the contrary, the\nCommission\u2019s control over the Board\u2019s investigatory and\nlegal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com\nmission has general supervisory powers over the Account\ning Board itself: It controls the Board\u2019s budget, \u00a7\u00a77219(b),\n(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any \u201cduties or functions\u201d\nthat it \u201cdetermines are necessary or appropriate,\u201d\n\u00a77211(c)(5); it has full \u201coversight and enforcement author\nity over the Board,\u201d \u00a77217(a), including the authority to\ninspect the Board\u2019s activities whenever it believes it \u201cap\npropriate\u201d to do so, \u00a77217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it\ncan censure the Board or its members, as well as remove\nthe members from office, if the members, for example, fail\nto enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or\nabuse the authority granted to them under the Act,\n\u00a77217(d)(3).

See 15\nU. S. C. \u00a77215. This Court has long recognized the appro\npriateness of using \u201cfor cause\u201d provisions to protect the\npersonal independence of those who even only sometimes\nengage in adjudicatory functions.

The\nCourt, however, all but ignores the Board\u2019s adjudicatory\nfunctions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at\n17\u201318. And when it finally does address that central\nfunction (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board\ndoes not \u201cperform adjudicative . . . functions,\u201d ante, at 26,\nn. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent\nwith the terms of the statute.

Congress delib\nerately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,\n148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352\u201313355. It did so for\ngood reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting\nBoard was created in response to \u201ca series of celebrated\naccounting debacles\u201d); H. R. Rep. No. 107\u2013414, pp. 18\u201319\n(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8\u20139. And\nhistorically, this regulatory subject matter\u2014financial\nregulation\u2014has been thought to exhibit a particular need\nfor independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)\n(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal\nTrade Commission) (\u201c[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra\ntive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold\nthe power of life and death over the great business inter\nests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .\ntaking these business matters out of politics\u201d). And Con\ngress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess, \u00a77219, helped insulate the Board from congres\nsional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148\nCong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).\n   In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably\nhave thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board\nmembers from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.

S. 425 (1977),\nthe Court made clear that when \u201cdetermining whether the\nAct disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to\nwhich it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish\ning its constitutionally assigned functions.\u201d Id., at 443.\nThe Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a\nrestriction on the President\u2019s removal power. 487 U. S., at\n691 (\u201c[T]he real question is whether the removal restric\ntions are of such a nature that they impede the President\u2019s\nability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func\ntions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that\nlight\u201d). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat\ndiminish the Commission\u2019s ability to control the Board,\nbut it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to\nthe President\u2019s ability to control the Board, let alone to\ncoordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II\u2013A, supra.\nIndeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric\ntion that significantly interfered with the President\u2019s\nimportant historic power to control criminal prosecutions,\na \u201c \u2018purely executive\u2019 \u201d function, 487 U. S., at 687\u2013689, the\nconstitutionality of the present restriction would seem to\nfollow a fortiori.\n   Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re\npeatedly upheld \u201cfor cause\u201d provisions where they restrict\nthe President\u2019s power to remove an officer with adjudica\ntory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295\nU. S., at 623\u2013628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at\n17\u201318 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also\nupheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with\ntechnical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special\nindependence. E.g., Humphrey\u2019s Executor, supra, at 624.\nThe Accounting Board\u2019s functions involve both kinds of\nresponsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board\u2019s\nadjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its\njob, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor\ntance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job\nto the public strongly justify a statute that assures that\nBoard members need not fear for their jobs when compe\ntently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the\nCommission as the ultimate authority over Board policies\nand actions. See Part II\u2013B, supra.\n  Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way\nthat logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.\nIn Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484\u2014which was reaffirmed\nin Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,\nn. 27\u2014the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the\nauthority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a \u201ccadet\nengineer,\u201d whom the Court explicitly defined as an \u201cinfe\nrior officer.\u201d The Court said,\n       \u201cWe have no doubt that when Congress, by law,\n    vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads\n    of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of\n    removal as it deems best for the public interest. The\n    constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the\n    appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and\n    regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may\n    enact in relation to the officers so appointed.\u201d Per\n    kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota\n    tion marks omitted).\nSee also Morrison, supra, at 723\u2013724 (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning) (agreeing that the power to remove an \u201cinferior offi\n22      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ncer\u201d who is appointed by a department head can be re\nstricted). Cf. ante, at 30\u201333 (holding that SEC Commis\nsioners are \u201cHeads of Departments\u201d).\n   In Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the Court held that Congress\nmay constitutionally limit the President\u2019s authority to\nremove certain principal officers, including heads of de\npartments. 295 U. S., at 627\u2013629. And the Court has\nconsistently recognized the validity of that holding. See\nWiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706\n(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133\u2013136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,\nat 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725\u2013726; Morrison,\nsupra, at 686\u2013693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 410\u2013411 (1989).\n   And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated\nin a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, that \u201cadjusting the remainder of the\nConstitution to compensate for Humphrey\u2019s Executor is a\nfruitless endeavor.\u201d In these Justices\u2019 view, the Court\nshould not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence\nfor the \u201cindependent agencies.\u201d That being so, the law\nshould treat their heads as it treats other Executive\nBranch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court\nheld in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally \u201climit and\nrestrict\u201d the Commission\u2019s power to remove those whom\nthey appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).\n   Fourth, the Court has said that \u201c[o]ur separation-of\npowers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of\none branch\u2019s aggrandizing its power at the expense of\nanother branch.\u201d Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);\naccord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor\nrison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has\nadded that \u201cthe essence of the decision in Myers,\u201d which is\nthe only one of our cases to have struck down a \u201cfor cause\u201d\nremoval restriction, \u201cwas the judgment that the Constitu\ntion prevents Congress from \u2018draw[ing] to itself . . . the\npower to remove.\u2019 \u201d Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMyers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has\n\u201cdrawn\u201d no power to itself to remove the Board members.\nIt has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam\nple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC\nChairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the\nambit of the Court\u2019s most serious constitutional concern.\n   In sum, the Court\u2019s prior cases impose functional\ncriteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond\nthe Court\u2019s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., \u201cone plus\none is greater than one\u201d) our precedent virtually dictates\na holding that the challenged \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is\nconstitutional.\n                              D\n   We should ask one further question. Even if the \u201cfor\ncause\u201d provision before us does not itself significantly\ninterfere with the President\u2019s authority or aggrandize\nCongress\u2019 power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a\nbright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a\nseries of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,\nCongress might undercut the President\u2019s central constitu\ntional role? Cf. Strauss 625\u2013626. The answer to this\nquestion is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,\ninsofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.\nAnd in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious\nthan any imaginable harm this \u201cfor cause\u201d provision might\nbring about.\n   The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of its holding\u2014\nan uncertainty that the Court\u2019s opinion both reflects and\ngenerates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule\nmay not apply where an inferior officer \u201cperform[s] adjudi\ncative . . . functions.\u201d Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac\ncounting Board performs adjudicative functions.          See\n24      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsupra, at 17\u201318. What, then, are we to make of the\nCourt\u2019s potential exception? And would such an exception\napply to an administrative law judge who also has impor\ntant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,\ne.g., 8 CFR \u00a71003.9, 34 CFR \u00a781.4 (2009). The Court\nelsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal\nstatutes that provide for \u201cjudicial review of a[n] effort to\nremove\u201d an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But\nwe have previously stated that all officers protected by a\nfor-cause removal provision and later subject to termina\ntion are entitled to \u201cnotice and [a] hearing\u201d in the \u201ccourts,\u201d\nas without such review \u201cthe appointing power\u201d otherwise\n\u201ccould remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it\ndeemed sufficient.\u201d Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.\n419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum\nphrey\u2019s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging\nremoval). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,\nthen, should be given to this hint of an exception?\n   The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may\nnot apply to inferior officers who have a different relation\nship to their appointing agents than the relationship\nbetween the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,\n24\u201326. But the only characteristic of the \u201crelationship\u201d\nbetween the Commission and the Board that the Court\napparently deems relevant is that the relationship in\ncludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at\n23 (\u201cBroad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members\u201d). Why then would\nany different relationship that also includes two layers of\nfor-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.\nPart II\u2013A, supra (describing the Commission\u2019s near abso\nlute control over the Board). In a word, what differences\nare relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding\nin fact applies only where Congress has \u201cenacted an un\nusually high standard\u201d of for-cause removal\u2014and does not\notherwise render two layers of \u201c \u2018ordinary\u2019 \u201d for-cause re\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Compare Parts III\u2013A, III\u2013B,\nIII\u2013C, ante, with Parts II\u2013A, II\u2013B, II\u2013C, supra. And such\na mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying\nthat, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at\nleast at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding\nby its very nature is not \u201ca restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor\u201d one \u201cday and train only.\u201d Smith v. Allwright, 321\nU. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).\n   The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher\nent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its\nrule may not apply to \u201cthe civil service.\u201d Ante, at 26. The\n\u201ccivil service\u201d is defined by statute to include \u201call appoint\nive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,\u201d\nexcluding the military, but including all civil \u201cofficer[s]\u201d up\nto and including those who are subject to Senate confirma\ntion. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil\nservice thus includes many officers indistinguishable from\nthe members of both the Commission and the Accounting\nBoard. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the\n\u201ccompetitive service\u201d\u2014the class within the broader civil\nservice that enjoys the most robust career protection\u2014\n\u201cincludes a vast majority of all the civil officers\u201d in the\nUnited States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5\nU. S. C. \u00a72102(c).\n   But even if I assume that the majority categorically\nexcludes the competitive service from the scope of its new\nrule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu\nsion would be insufficient.

And who are they? Courts\nand scholars have struggled for more than a century to\ndefine the constitutional term \u201cinferior officers,\u201d without\nmuch success. See 2 J.

But here that kind of approach (when applied\nwithout more specificity than I can find in the Court\u2019s\nopinion) threatens serious harm.\n   The problem is not simply that the term \u201cinferior officer\u201d\nis indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

But the members of the Merit Systems\nProtection Board are themselves protected from removal\nby the President absent good cause. \u00a71202(d).\n   My research reflects that the Federal Government relies\non 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in\nover 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo\nrandum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage\nment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). These ALJs adjudicate\nSocial Security benefits, employment disputes, and other\nmatters highly important to individuals.

See Dept. of Defense,\nActive Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),\nonline at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/\nrg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that\nsuch officers may not be removed from office except for\ncause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7629\u2013\n632, 804, 1161, 1181\u20131185. And such officers can gener\nally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see\n\u00a7\u00a7612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career\nprotections.\n  The majority might simply say that the military is\ndifferent. But it will have to explain how it is different. It\nis difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a\nPresident who is the military\u2019s \u201ccommander-in-chief,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a72, cl. 1, with less authority to remove \u201cinferior\u201d\nmilitary \u201cofficers\u201d than to remove comparable civil offi\ncials. See Barron & Lederman, The Commander in Chief\nat the Lowest Ebb\u2014A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.\nL. Rev. 941, 1102\u20131106 (2008) (describing President\u2019s\n\u201csuperintendence prerogative\u201d over the military). Cf. ante,\nat 26\u201327 (not \u201cexpressing any view whatever\u201d as to\nwhether military officers\u2019 authority is now unconstitutional).\n  The majority sees \u201cno reason . . . to address whether\u201d\nany of \u201cthese positions,\u201d \u201cor any others,\u201d might be deemed\nunconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to\nleave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But\nwhat is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all\nthese various officials to be put on hold while the courts of\nappeals determine whether today\u2019s ruling applies to them?\nWill Congress have to act to remove the \u201cfor cause\u201d provi\nsions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142\u2013143. Can the Presi\ndent then restore them via executive order? And, still,\nwhat about the military? A clearer line would help avoid\nthese practical difficulties.\n  The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the\nGovernment\u2019s ability to function while these many ques\n32      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

But\nthis case was not brought by federal officials challenging\ntheir potential removal. It was brought by private indi\nviduals who were subject to regulation \u201c \u2018here-and-now\u2019 \u201d\nand who \u201cobject to the\u201d very \u201cexistence\u201d of the regulators\nthemselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those\nprivate individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person\nsimilarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially\nsubject to the Court\u2019s amorphous new rule will be able to\nbring an \u201cimplied private right of action directly under the\nConstitution\u201d \u201cseeking . . . a declaratory judgment that\u201d\nthe official\u2019s actions are \u201cunconstitutional and an injunc\ntion preventing the\u201d official \u201cfrom exercising [his] powers.\u201d\nAnte, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.\nVelazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of\npreliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of\npowers violation); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S.\n579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Ante, at 7\u201310.\n   Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure\nsuch a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend\ning removal provision. For a court\u2019s \u201cability to devise\n[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly\u201d\nthe \u201cbackground constitutional rules at issue\u201d have been\n\u201carticulated\u201d; severance will be unavailable \u201cin a murky\nconstitutional context,\u201d which is precisely the context that\nthe Court\u2019s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent\nhood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).\nMoreover, \u201cthe touchstone\u201d of the severability analysis \u201cis\nlegislative intent,\u201d id., at 330, and Congress has repeat\nedly expressed its judgment \u201cover the last century that it\nis in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that\nfederal service should depend upon meritorious perform\nance rather than political service,\u201d Civil Service Comm\u2019n,\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 367,\n380\u2013388 (1983) (describing the history of \u201cCongressional\nattention to the problem of politically-motivated removals\u201d).\nAnd so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the\nmany questions the majority\u2019s opinion raises will not only\napply the Court\u2019s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will\nalso determine that the only available remedy to certain\ndouble for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.\n   Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s assertions to the\ncontrary, the potential consequences of today\u2019s holding are\nworrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To\ninterpret the Court\u2019s decision as applicable only in a few\ncircumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbi-\ntrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the\nrule more rational, but destructive.\n                                III\n  One last question: How can the Court simply assume\nwithout deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves\nare removable only \u201cfor cause\u201d? See ante, at 5 (\u201c[W]e\ndecide the case with th[e] understanding\u201d \u201cthat the Com-\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi-\ndent except\u201d for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the\nCommissioners themselves are in fact protected by a \u201cfor\ncause\u201d requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the\nCourt\u2019s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I\nam not aware of any other instance in which the Court has\nsimilarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a\nconstitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that\ndefect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.\nAlabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (\u201cWe\ndo not\u2014we cannot\u2014add provisions to a federal statute . . .\nespecially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would\n[thereby] arise\u201d); The Anaconda v.

Unlike the statutes establish-\ning the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the\nstatute that established the Commission says nothing\nabout removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its\ntext is concerned, the President\u2019s authority to remove the\nCommissioners is no different from his authority to re-\nmove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See\nShurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (\u201cTo take away th[e] power of\nremoval . . . would require very clear and explicit lan-\nguage. It should not be held to be taken away by mere\ninference or implication\u201d); see also Memorandum from\nDavid J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel\nto the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator\nfor Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.\n23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-\nproject.pdf (\u201c[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide\ntenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .\nsettled principles, may remove . . . without cause\u201d); The\nConstitutional Separation of Powers Between the Presi-\ndent and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)\n(same).\n   Nor is the absence of a \u201cfor cause\u201d provision in the stat-\nute that created the Commission likely to have been inad-\nvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9-\nyear period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby\ncast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all \u201cfor cause\u201d\nremoval provisions, but before it decided Humphrey\u2019s\nExecutor, which removed any doubt in respect to the con-\nstitutionality of making commissioners of independent\nagencies removable only for cause. In other words, Con-\ngress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court\u2019s\nprecedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make\nthe Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat 9-year period, Congress created at least three major\nfederal agencies without making any of their officers\nremovable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778d\n(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46\nStat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission with \u201cfor cause\u201d protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a77171). By way of contrast, only one month after\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor was decided, Congress returned to\nits pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in\nstatutes creating independent commissions. See \u00a73, 49\nStat. 451, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7153 (establishing National Labor\nRelations Board with an explicit removal limitation).\n   The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis\nsioners removable \u201cfor cause\u201d does not mean it intended to\ncreate a dependent, rather than an independent agency.\nAgency independence is a function of several different\nfactors, of which \u201cfor cause\u201d protection is only one. Those\nfactors include, inter alia, an agency\u2019s separate (rather\nthan presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its\nseparate litigating authority, its composition as a multi\nmember bipartisan board, the use of the word \u201cindepend\nent\u201d in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political\nenvironment, reflecting tradition and function, that would\nimpose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried\nto remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.\nSee generally Breger & Edles 1135\u20131155.\n   The absence of a \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is thus not fatal to\nagency independence. Indeed, a \u201cCongressional Research\nService official suggests that there are at least 13 \u2018inde\npendent\u2019 agencies without a removal provision in their\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing\ncongressional testimony). But it does draw the majority\u2019s\nrule into further confusion. For not only are we left with\nout a definition of an \u201cinferior officer,\u201d but we are also left\n36      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

If any agency\ndeemed \u201cindependent\u201d will be similarly treated, the scope\nof the majority\u2019s holding is even broader still. See Appen\ndix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).\n   The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute\nbooks a \u201cfor cause removal\u201d phrase that does not appear in\nthe relevant statute and which Congress probably did not\nintend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not\nto uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con\nstruction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but\nits opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is not the habit of the\nCourt to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless\nabsolutely necessary to a decision of the case\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); NLRB v.

S. 490, 500 (1979) (\u201c[A]n Act of Congress\nought not to be construed to violate the Constitution if any\nother possible construction remains available\u201d).\n   I do not need to decide whether the Commissioners are\nin fact removable only \u201cfor cause\u201d because I would uphold\nthe Accounting Board\u2019s removal provision as constitu\ntional regardless. But were that not so, a determination\nthat the silent SEC statute means no more than it says\nwould properly avoid the determination of unconstitution\nality that the Court now makes.\n                        *     *     *\n  In my view the Court\u2019s decision is wrong\u2014very wrong.\nAs Parts II\u2013A, II\u2013B, and II\u2013C of this opinion make clear, if\nthe Court were to look to the proper functional and contex\ntual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board\nprovision constitutional. As Part II\u2013D shows, insofar as\nthe Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails\nto do so. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In light of the present imprecision, it must either\nnarrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually\nalone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in\nplace a broader rule of decision applicable to many other\n\u201cinferior officers\u201d as well. In doing the latter, it will un\ndermine the President\u2019s authority. And it will create an\nobstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func\ntioning of that workable Government that the Constitu\ntion seeks to create\u2014in provisions this Court is sworn to\nuphold.\n   With respect I dissent.\n38      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Each of these officials is,\nunder any definition\u2014including the Court\u2019s\u2014an inferior\nofficer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause\nremoval. See supra, at 25\u201330.\n   The data are organized into three columns: The first\ncolumn lists the \u201coffice\u201d to which the corresponding official\nis assigned within the respective agency and, where avail\nable, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.\nsupra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307\u2013308; Ger\nmaine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns\nrespectively list the career appointees in each agency who\noccupy \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201creserved\u201d SES positions. A \u201cgen\neral\u201d position is one that could be filled by either a career\nappointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current\n(career) occupant to be replaced.           See 5       U. S. C.\n\u00a73132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be\nfilled by career appointees, \u00a73134(b), \u201cmost General posi\ntions are filled by career appointees,\u201d Plum Book 200. A\n\u201creserved\u201d position, by contrast, must always be filled by a\ncareer appointee. \u00a73132(b)(1). The data for the \u201cgeneral\nposition\u201d column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad\nrennial manual prepared by the congressional committees\nresponsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.\nPositions listed as vacant in that source are not included.\nThe data for the \u201creserved position\u201d column come from a\nlist periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man\nagement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.\n16154\u201316251 (2007); \u00a73132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s size and the temporal lag between the underly\ning sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra\ntive, not exact.\n                           Cite as: 561 U.
