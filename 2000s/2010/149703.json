PUBLIC COM-\n\n     PANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–861.      Argued December 7, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was\n  created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-\n  Oxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed\n  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri\n  vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry—such as\n  the New York Stock Exchange—that investigate and discipline their\n  own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi\n  zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive\n  powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au\n  dits public companies under the securities laws must register with\n  the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over\n  sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves\n  tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.\n  The parties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for con\n  stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora\n  tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are “ ‘Officers of the\n  United States’ ” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the\n  laws of the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126.\n  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board\n  members at will, but only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance\n  with” specified procedures. §§7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also\n  agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re\n  moved by the President except for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\n  malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295\n  U. S. 602, 620.\n     The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report\n  critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.\n2          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza\n    tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,\n    seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon\n    stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its\n    powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened\n    the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board\n    members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis\n    for petitioners’ challenge was that Board members were insulated\n    from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board\n    members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,\n    and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi\n    dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board’s ap\n    pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi\n    cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate’s advice and\n    consent, or—in the case of “inferior Officers”—by “the President\n    alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,”\n    Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.\n    The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary\n    judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first\n    agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the\n    dual restraints on Board members’ removal are permissible, and that\n    Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent\n    with the Appointments Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The\n Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag\n grieved party may challenge the Commission’s “final order” or “rule”\n in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. §78y. The Government reads\n §78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly\n or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis\n trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju\n risdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju\n dicial review”; if the suit is “ ‘wholly “collateral” ’ to a statute’s review\n provisions”; and if the claims are “outside the agency’s expertise.”\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212–213.\n    These considerations point against any limitation on review here.\n Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti\n tioners’ challenge is “collateral” to any Commission orders or rules\n from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti\n tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti\n tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no “meaningful” avenue of\n relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a\n sanction in order to test a law’s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen\n tech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129. Petitioners’ constitutional claims are\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Pp. 7–10.\n   2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members\ncontravene the Constitution’s separation of powers. Pp. 10–27.\n      (a) The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be\nvested in a President of the United States of America.” Art. II, §1,\ncl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower\nthe President to keep executive officers accountable—by removing\nthem from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,\n272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not\nwithout limit. In Humphrey’s Executor, supra, this Court held that\nCongress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen\ncies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the\nPresident may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in\nUnited States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of\nprincipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the Presi\ndent—to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not\naddressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten\nure. Pp. 10–14.\n      (b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the\nPresident’s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa\nrated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The\nPresident—or a subordinate he could remove at will—decided\nwhether the officer’s conduct merited removal under the good-cause\nstandard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re\nmoval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any\ndecision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in\nother tenured officers—the Commissioners—who are not subject to\nthe President’s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re\nmove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com\nmission fully accountable for the Board’s conduct. He can only review\nthe Commissioner’s determination of whether the Act’s rigorous good\ncause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de\ntermination, he is powerless to intervene—unless the determination\nis so unreasonable as to constitute “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 620.\n   This arrangement contradicts Article II’s vesting of the executive\npower in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or\nto attribute the Board’s failings to those whom he can oversee, the\nPresident is no longer the judge of the Board’s conduct. He can nei\nther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon\nsible for a Board member’s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re\n4          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    sponsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further\n    by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure. Such diffusion of\n    power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and\n    effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the\n    blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act’s restrictions are\n    therefore incompatible with the Constitution’s separation of powers.\n    Pp. 14–17.\n         (c) The “ ‘fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven\n    ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing\n    alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. ” Bowsher\n    v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act’s multilevel tenure protections\n    provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.\n    Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of\n    fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The\n    Framers created a structure in which “[a] dependence on the people”\n    would be the “primary controul on the government,” and that de\n    pendence is maintained by giving each branch “the necessary consti\n    tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the\n    others.” The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key “constitutional means”\n    vested in the President was “the power of appointing, overseeing, and\n    controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Congress 463.\n    While a government of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes\n    inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n    51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc\n    tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving\n    liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17–21.\n         (d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con\n    straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\n    Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of\n    the Commission’s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to\n    avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission’s broad power over Board\n    functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter\n    ing the Board’s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control\n    an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board\n    members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the\n    Commission’s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board\n    may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of\n    the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no\n    tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro\n    managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids\n    any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi\n    nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub\n    stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of\n    good-cause removal.

The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the\nremainder of the statute. Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part\nof an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re\nmaining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n\nof Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the “normal rule” is “that partial . . . in\nvalidation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\n472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board’s existence does not violate the sepa\nration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by\n§§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric\ntions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains “ ‘fully\noperative as a law,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,\nand nothing in the Act’s text or historical context makes it “evident”\nthat Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose\nmembers are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to\nfunction as before, but its members may be removed at will by the\nCommission. Pp. 27–29.\n   4. The Board’s appointment is consistent with the Appointments\nClause. Pp. 29–33.\n      (a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment\nCongress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].” Infe\nrior officers “are officers whose work is directed and supervised at\nsome level” by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate’s\nconsent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663. Because\nthe good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and\nvoid, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members\nat will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members\nare therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29–30.\n      (b) The Commission is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments\nClause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi\ncally reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as”\nthe SEC, is a “Departmen[t].” The Court now adopts the reasoning of\nthe concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that\nthe SEC is such a “Departmen[t]” because it is a freestanding compo\nnent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within\nany other such component. This reading is consistent with the com\nmon, near-contemporary definition of a “department”; with the early\npractice of Congress, see §3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court’s cases,\nwhich have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of\nsuch an establishment. Pp. 30–31.\n      (c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the\nCommission’s “Hea[d].” The Commission’s powers are generally\nvested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.

There is\n    no reason why a multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a\n    “Departmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessar\n    ily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts of Law,”\n    Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers col\n    lectively, see, e.g., Art. I, §2, cl. 5.

Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n951 (1983). Article II vests “[t]he executive Power . . . in a\nPresident of the United States of America,” who must\n“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II,\n§1, cl. 1; id., §3. In light of “[t]he impossibility that one\nman should be able to perform all the great business of the\nState,” the Constitution provides for executive officers to\n“assist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties\nof his trust.” 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.\nFitzpatrick ed. 1939).\n  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to\nempower the President to keep these officers account­\nable—by removing them from office, if necessary. See\ngenerally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).\nThis Court has determined, however, that this authority is\nnot without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStates, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,\nunder certain circumstances, create independent agencies\nrun by principal officers appointed by the President, whom\nthe President may not remove at will but only for good\ncause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483\n(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the\nCourt sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin­\ncipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the\nPresident—to remove their own inferiors. The parties do\nnot ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we\ndo not do so.\n  We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not\nyet encountered by the Court. The question is whether\nthese separate layers of protection may be combined. May\nthe President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin­\ncipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to\nremove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer\ndetermines the policy and enforces the laws of the United\nStates?\n  We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is\ncontrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in\nthe President. The President cannot “take Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the\nfaithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the\nPresident cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than\none level of good-cause protection, even if the President\ndetermines that the officer is neglecting his duties or\ndischarging them improperly. That judgment is instead\ncommitted to another officer, who may or may not agree\nwith the President’s determination, and whom the Presi­\ndent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees\nwith him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional\nobligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”\nId., at 693.\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Among other measures, the Act introduced\ntighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board\nis composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5­\nyear terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in\nthe securities industry—such as the New York Stock\nExchange—that investigate and discipline their own\nmembers subject to Commission oversight. Congress\ncreated the Board as a private “nonprofit corporation,” and\nBoard members and employees are not considered Gov­\nernment “officer[s] or employee[s]” for statutory purposes.\n15 U. S. C. §§7211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its\nmembers and employees from the private sector by paying\nsalaries far above the standard Government pay scale.\nSee §§7211(f)(4), 7219.1\n   Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the\nBoard is a Government-created, Government-appointed\nentity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus­\ntry. Every accounting firm—both foreign and domestic—\nthat participates in auditing public companies under the\nsecurities laws must register with the Board, pay it an\nannual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.\n§§7211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is\ncharged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu­\nrities laws, the Commission’s rules, its own rules, and\nprofessional accounting standards. §§7215(b)(1), (c)(4). To\nthis end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac­\ncounting firm’s practice, including hiring and professional\n——————\n 1 The current salary for the Chairman is $673,000.

The willful violation of any Board\nrule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex­\nchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq.—\na federal crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprison­\nment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per­\nson). §§78ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.). And the Board itself\ncan issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings,\nup to and including the permanent revocation of a firm’s\nregistration, a permanent ban on a person’s associating\nwith any registered firm, and money penalties of $15\nmillion ($750,000 for a natural person). §7215(c)(4).\nDespite the provisions specifying that Board members are\nnot Government officials for statutory purposes, the par­\nties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for\nconstitutional purposes, Lebron v.

The\nCommission cannot remove Board members at will, but\nonly “for good cause shown,” “in accordance with” certain\nprocedures. §7211(e)(6).\n  Those procedures require a Commission finding, “on the\nrecord” and “after notice and opportunity for a hearing,”\nthat the Board member\n    “(A) has willfully violated any provision of th[e] Act,\n    the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;\n    “(B) has willfully abused the authority of that mem­\n    ber; or\n    “(C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has\n    failed to enforce compliance with any such provision\n    or rule, or any professional standard by any registered\n    public accounting firm or any associated person\n    thereof.” §7217(d)(3).\nRemoval of a Board member requires a formal Commis­\nsion order and is subject to judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.\n§§554(a), 556(a), 557(a), (c)(B); 15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1).\nSimilar procedures govern the Commission’s removal of\nofficers and directors of the private self-regulatory organi­\nzations. See §78s(h)(4). The parties agree that the Com­\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi­\ndent except under the Humphrey’s Executor standard of\n“inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” 295\nU. S., at 620 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Brief\nfor Petitioners 31; Brief for United States 43; Brief for\nRespondent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n31 (hereinafter PCAOB Brief); Tr. of Oral Arg. 47, and we\ndecide the case with that understanding.\n                             B\n  Beckstead and Watts, LLP, is a Nevada accounting firm\nregistered with the Board. The Board inspected the firm,\nreleased a report critical of its auditing procedures, and\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbegan a formal investigation. Beckstead and Watts and\nthe Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of\nwhich the firm is a member, then sued the Board and its\nmembers, seeking (among other things) a declaratory\njudgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an in­\njunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.\nApp. 71.\n   Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers\nby conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board\nmembers without subjecting them to Presidential control.\nId., at 67–68. Petitioners also challenged the Act under\nthe Appointments Clause, which requires “Officers of the\nUnited States” to be appointed by the President with the\nSenate’s advice and consent. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The Clause\nprovides an exception for “inferior Officers,” whose ap­\npointment Congress may choose to vest “in the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart­\nments.” Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC,\npetitioners argued that (1) Board members are not “infe­\nrior Officers” who may be appointed by “Heads of Depart­\nments”; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a “De­\npartmen[t]”; and (3) even if it is, the several\nCommissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its\n“Hea[d].” See App. 68–70. The United States intervened\nto defend the Act’s constitutionality. Both sides moved for\nsummary judgment; the District Court determined that it\nhad jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to re­\nspondents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–117a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 537 F. 3d 667\n(CADC 2008). It agreed that the District Court had juris­\ndiction over petitioners’ claims. Id., at 671. On the mer­\nits, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue\nwas “a question of first impression,” as neither that court\nnor this one “ha[d] considered a situation where a restric­\ntion on removal passes through two levels of control.” Id.,\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem­\nbers’ removal are permissible because they do not “render\nthe President unable to perform his constitutional duties.”\nId., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the\nPresident “does not directly select or supervise the Board’s\nmembers,” id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre­\nhensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi­\ndent’s influence over the Commission implies a constitu­\ntionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at\n682–683. The majority also held that Board members are\ninferior officers subject to the Commission’s direction and\nsupervision, id., at 672–676, and that their appointment is\notherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at\n676–678.\n   Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case\nwas one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that\n“the double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .\ncombine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control\nover the [Board],” id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also\nargued that Board members are not effectively supervised\nby the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers\nunder the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709–712.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the District Court had juris­\ndiction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes\nproviding for judicial review of Commission action did not\nprevent the District Court from considering petitioners’\nclaims.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to\nreview any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.\n§§7217(b)(2)–(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted,\naggrieved parties may challenge “a final order of the\nCommission” or “a rule of the Commission” in a court of\nappeals under §78y, and “[n]o objection . . . may be consid­\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nered by the court unless it was urged before the Commis­\nsion or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.”\n§§78y(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1).\n   The Government reads §78y as an exclusive route to\nreview. But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdic­\ntion that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. §§1331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.\nProvisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review\nunless the “statutory scheme” displays a “fairly discerni­\nble” intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue\n“are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within\nth[e] statutory structure.” Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.\nReich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates proce­\ndures “designed to permit agency expertise to be brought\nto bear on particular problems,” those procedures “are to\nbe exclusive.” Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v.\nBank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420\n(1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to\nlimit jurisdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose\nall meaningful judicial review”; if the suit is “wholly col­\nlateral to a statute’s review provisions”; and if the claims\nare “outside the agency’s expertise.” Thunder Basin,\nsupra, at 212–213 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThese considerations point against any limitation on\nreview here.\n   We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pur­\nsue their constitutional claims under the Government’s\ntheory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of\nCommission action, and not every Board action is encapsu­\nlated in a final Commission order or rule.\n   The Government suggests that petitioners could first\nhave sought Commission review of the Board’s “auditing\nstandards, registration requirements, or other rules.”\nBrief for United States 16. But petitioners object to the\nBoard’s existence, not to any of its auditing standards.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners’ general challenge to the Board is “collateral”\nto any Commission orders or rules from which review\nmight be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,\nInc., 498 U. S. 479, 491–492 (1991). Requiring petitioners\nto select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd\nprocedure for Congress to choose, especially because only\nnew rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.\nSee 15 U. S. C. §§78s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).\n  Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to\nraise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for\nUnited States 16–17. But the investigation of Beckstead\nand Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),\nand an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject\nto judicial review, see §7214(h)(2). So the Government\nproposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such\nas a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu­\nments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the\nCommission then affirms, the firm will win access to a\ncourt of appeals—and severe punishment should its chal­\nlenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to “bet\nthe farm . . . by taking the violative action” before “testing\nthe validity of the law,” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,\nInc., 549 U. S. 118, 129 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young,\n209 U. S. 123 (1908), and we do not consider this a “mean­\ningful” avenue of relief. Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212.\n  Petitioners’ constitutional claims are also outside the\nCommission’s competence and expertise. In Thunder\nBasin, the petitioner’s primary claims were statutory; “at\nroot . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll\nsquarely within the [agency’s] expertise,” given that the\nagency had “extensive experience” on the issue and had\n“recently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.” Id.,\nat 214–215. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329\nU. S. 287 (1946), on which the Government relies, we\nreserved for the agency fact-bound inquiries that, even if\n10        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Id., at 294.\nNo similar expertise is required here, and the statutory\nquestions involved do not require “technical considerations\nof [agency] policy.” Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 373\n(1974). They are instead standard questions of adminis­\ntrative law, which the courts are at no disadvantage in\nanswering.\n   We therefore conclude that §78y did not strip the Dis­\ntrict Court of jurisdiction over these claims, which are\nproperly presented for our review.2\n                          III\n  We hold that the dual for-cause limitations on the re­\nmoval of Board members contravene the Constitution’s\nseparation of powers.\n                          A\n  The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power\nshall be vested in a President of the United States of\n\n——————\n  2 The Government asserts that “petitioners have not pointed to any\n\ncase in which this Court has recognized an implied private right of\naction directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action\nunder the Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers principles.”\nBrief for United States 22. The Government does not appear to dispute\nsuch a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particu­\nlar constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g., Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 74 (2001) (equitable relief “has\nlong been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from\nacting unconstitutionally”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[I]t\nis established practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdiction of\nfederal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights safeguarded by the\nConstitution”); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 149, 165, 167\n(1908). If the Government’s point is that an Appointments Clause or\nseparation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every\nother constitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority\nwhy that might be so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmerica.” Art. II, §1, cl. 1. As Madison stated on the floor\nof the First Congress, “if any power whatsoever is in its\nnature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing,\nand controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of\nCong. 463 (1789).\n   The removal of executive officers was discussed exten­\nsively in Congress when the first executive departments\nwere created. The view that “prevailed, as most consonant\nto the text of the Constitution” and “to the requisite re­\nsponsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,”\nwas that the executive power included a power to oversee\nexecutive officers through removal; because that tradi­\ntional executive power was not “expressly taken away, it\nremained with the President.” Letter from James Madi­\nson to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary\nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). “This\nDecision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty\nevidence of the Constitution’s meaning since many of the\nMembers of the First Congress had taken part in framing\nthat instrument.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–\n724 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).

United States reaffirmed\nthe principle that Article II confers on the President “the\ngeneral administrative control of those executing the\nlaws.” 272 U. S., at 164. It is his responsibility to take\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops\nwith the President, in Harry Truman’s famous phrase. As\nwe explained in Myers, the President therefore must have\nsome “power of removing those for whom he can not con­\ntinue to be responsible.” Id., at 117.\n   Nearly a decade later in Humphrey’s Executor, this\nCourt held that Myers did not prevent Congress from\nconferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of\n12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncertain independent agencies. That case concerned the\nmembers of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7­\nyear terms and could not be removed by the President\nexcept for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\noffice.’ ” 295 U. S., at 620 (quoting 15 U. S. C. §41). The\nCourt distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers\nconcerned “an officer [who] is merely one of the units in\nthe executive department and, hence, inherently subject to\nthe exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief\nExecutive, whose subordinate and aid he is.” 295 U. S., at\n627. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as\n“quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial” rather than “purely\nexecutive,” and held that Congress could require it “to act\n. . . independently of executive control.” Id., at 627–629.\nBecause “one who holds his office only during the pleasure\nof another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an atti­\ntude of independence against the latter’s will,” the Court\nheld that Congress had power to “fix the period during\nwhich [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to\nforbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.”\nId., at 629.\n    Humphrey’s Executor did not address the removal of\ninferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in\nheads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily\nthe department head, rather than the President, who\nenjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119,\n127; Hennen, supra, at 259–260. This Court has upheld\nfor-cause limitations on that power as well.\n    In Perkins, a naval cadet-engineer was honorably dis­\ncharged from the Navy because his services were no longer\nrequired. 116 U. S. 483. He brought a claim for his salary\nunder statutes barring his peacetime discharge except by\na court-martial or by the Secretary of the Navy “for mis­\nconduct.” Rev. Stat. §§1229, 1525. This Court adopted\nverbatim the reasoning of the Court of Claims, which had\nheld that when Congress “ ‘vests the appointment of infe­\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrior officers in the heads of Departments[,] it may limit\nand restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the\npublic interest.’ ” 116 U. S., at 485. Because Perkins had\nnot been “ ‘dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the\nsentence of a court-martial,’ ” the Court agreed that he was\n“ ‘still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.’ ” Ibid.3\n    We again considered the status of inferior officers in\nMorrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government\nAct, which provided for an independent counsel to investi­\ngate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The\ncounsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full\npowers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attor­\nney General only “ ‘for good cause.’ ” 487 U. S., at 663\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. §596(a)(1)). We recognized that the\nindependent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,\nrather than “ ‘quasi-legislative’ ” or “ ‘quasi-judicial,’ ” but\nwe stated as “our present considered view” that Congress\nhad power to impose good-cause restrictions on her re­\nmoval. 487 U. S., at 689–691. The Court noted that the\nstatute “g[a]ve the Attorney General,” an officer directly\nresponsible to the President and “through [whom]” the\nPresident could act, “several means of supervising or\ncontrolling” the independent counsel—“[m]ost importantly\n. . . the power to remove the counsel for good cause.” Id.,\nat 695–696 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under\n——————\n  3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a\n\nprincipal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. §415, and\nthe Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his\nremoval. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. §1767. This requirement\nwas widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally\nregarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,\n1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167–\n168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986).\nPerkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in\ncombination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The\nCourt of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only\nthe authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthose circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.\nMorrison did not, however, address the consequences of\nmore than one level of good-cause tenure—leaving the\nissue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, “a\nquestion of first impression” in this Court. 537 F. 3d, at\n679; see id., at 698 (dissenting opinion).\n                              B\n   As explained, we have previously upheld limited restric­\ntions on the President’s removal power. In those cases,\nhowever, only one level of protected tenure separated the\nPresident from an officer exercising executive power. It\nwas the President—or a subordinate he could remove at\nwill—who decided whether the officer’s conduct merited\nremoval under the good-cause standard.\n   The Act before us does something quite different. It not\nonly protects Board members from removal except for good\ncause, but withdraws from the President any decision on\nwhether that good cause exists. That decision is vested\ninstead in other tenured officers—the Commissioners—\nnone of whom is subject to the President’s direct control.\nThe result is a Board that is not accountable to the Presi­\ndent, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.\n   The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.\nWithout a layer of insulation between the Commission and\nthe Board, the Commission could remove a Board member\nat any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for\nwhat the Board does. The President could then hold the\nCommission to account for its supervision of the Board, to\nthe same extent that he may hold the Commission to\naccount for everything else it does.\n   A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of\nthe President’s review. Now the Commission cannot\nremove a Board member at will. The President therefore\ncannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the\nBoard’s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission accountable for everything else that it does.\nThe Commissioners are not responsible for the Board’s\nactions. They are only responsible for their own determi­\nnation of whether the Act’s rigorous good-cause standard\nis met. And even if the President disagrees with their\ndetermination, he is powerless to intervene—unless that\ndetermination is so unreasonable as to constitute “ineffi­\nciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   This novel structure does not merely add to the Board’s\nindependence, but transforms it. Neither the President,\nnor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer\nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full\ncontrol over the Board. The President is stripped of the\npower our precedents have preserved, and his ability to\nexecute the laws—by holding his subordinates accountable\nfor their conduct—is impaired.\n   That arrangement is contrary to Article II’s vesting of\nthe executive power in the President. Without the ability\nto oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board’s failings to\nthose whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the\njudge of the Board’s conduct. He is not the one who de­\ncides whether Board members are abusing their offices or\nneglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the\nlaws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a\nBoard member’s breach of faith. This violates the basic\nprinciple that the President “cannot delegate ultimate\nresponsibility or the active obligation to supervise that\ngoes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President\nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.”\nClinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 712–713 (1997) (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in judgment).4\n——————\n 4 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 12–14 (opinion of\n\nBREYER, J.), the second layer of tenure protection does compromise the\n16       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Indeed, if allowed to stand, this dispersion of responsi­\nbility could be multiplied. If Congress can shelter the\nbureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why\nnot a third? At oral argument, the Government was un­\nwilling to concede that even five layers between the Presi­\ndent and the Board would be too many. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n47–48. The officers of such an agency—safely encased\nwithin a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections—would be\nimmune from Presidential oversight, even as they exer­\ncised power in the people’s name.\n   Perhaps an individual President might find advantages\nin tying his own hands. But the separation of powers does\nnot depend on the views of individual Presidents, see\nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879–880 (1991),\nnor on whether “the encroached-upon branch approves the\nencroachment,” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992). The President can always choose to restrain\nhimself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot,\nhowever, choose to bind his successors by diminishing\ntheir powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his\nchoices by pretending that they are not his own.\n   The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of\naccountability. The people do not vote for the “Officers of\nthe United States.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2. They instead look to\nthe President to guide the “assistants or deputies . . .\nsubject to his superintendence.” The Federalist No. 72, p.\n——————\nPresident’s ability to remove a Board member the Commission wants to\nretain. Without a second layer of protection, the Commission has no\nexcuse for retaining an officer who is not faithfully executing the law.\nWith the second layer in place, the Commission can shield its decision\nfrom Presidential review by finding that good cause is absent—a\nfinding that, given the Commission’s own protected tenure, the Presi­\ndent cannot easily overturn. The dissent describes this conflict merely\nas one of four possible “scenarios,” see post, at 12–13, but it is the\ncentral issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the\nPresident finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and\na statute prevents him from doing so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Without a clear\nand effective chain of command, the public cannot “deter­\nmine on whom the blame or the punishment of a perni­\ncious measure, or series of pernicious measures ought\nreally to fall.” Id., No. 70, at 476 (same). That is why the\nFramers sought to ensure that “those who are employed in\nthe execution of the law will be in their proper situation,\nand the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest\nofficers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as\nthey ought, on the President, and the President on the\ncommunity.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).\n   By granting the Board executive power without the\nExecutive’s oversight, this Act subverts the President’s\nability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed—as\nwell as the public’s ability to pass judgment on his efforts.\nThe Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitu­\ntion’s separation of powers.\n                              C\n   Respondents and the dissent resist this conclusion,\nportraying the Board as “the kind of practical accommoda­\ntion between the Legislature and the Executive that\nshould be permitted in a ‘workable government.’ ” Metro\npolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for\nAbatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276 (1991)\n(MWAA) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Saw\nyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring));\nsee, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). According to\nthe dissent, Congress may impose multiple levels of for­\ncause tenure between the President and his subordinates\nwhen it “rests agency independence upon the need for\ntechnical expertise.” Post, at 18. The Board’s mission is\nsaid to demand both “technical competence” and “apolitical\nexpertise,” and its powers may only be exercised by “tech­\nnical professional experts.” Post, at 18 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In this respect the statute creating the\n18      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBoard is, we are told, simply one example of the “vast\nnumbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,\nconcerned with vast numbers of different problems, [that]\nprovide for, or foresee, their execution or administration\nthrough the work of administrators organized within\nmany different kinds of administrative structures, exercis­\ning different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve\ntheir legislatively mandated objectives.” Post, at 8.\n    No one doubts Congress’s power to create a vast and\nvaried federal bureaucracy. But where, in all this, is the\nrole for oversight by an elected President? The Constitu­\ntion requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation\noversee the execution of the laws. And the “ ‘fact that a\ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful\nin facilitating functions of government, standing alone,\nwill not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,’ ” for\n“ ‘[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objec­\ntives—or the hallmarks—of democratic government.’ ”\nBowsher, 478 U. S., at 736 (quoting Chadha, 462 U. S., at\n944).\n    One can have a government that functions without\nbeing ruled by functionaries, and a government that bene­\nfits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our\nConstitution was adopted to enable the people to govern\nthemselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of\nthe Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and\ntouches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the\nconcern that it may slip from the Executive’s control, and\nthus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab­\nsent from the dissent’s paean to the administrative state.\n    For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of\nremoval as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi­\ndent’s “power to get something done” more often depends\non “who controls the agency’s budget requests and fund­\ning, the relationships between one agency or department\nand another, . . . purely political factors (including Con­\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress’ ability to assert influence),” and indeed whether\nparticular unelected officials support or “resist” the Presi­\ndent’s policies. Post, at 11, 13 (emphasis deleted). The\nFramers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic\nminutiae. As we said in Bowsher, supra, at 730, “[t]he\nseparated powers of our Government cannot be permitted\nto turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exer­\ncising executive power is on good terms with Congress.”\n   In fact, the multilevel protection that the dissent en­\ndorses “provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the\nlegislative power.” MWAA, supra, at 277. In a system of\nchecks and balances, “[p]ower abhors a vacuum,” and one\nbranch’s handicap is another’s strength. 537 F. 3d, at 695,\nn. 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Even when a branch does not arrogate power to\nitself,” therefore, it must not “impair another in the per­\nformance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996).5 Congress has plenary\ncontrol over the salary, duties, and even existence of ex­\necutive offices. Only Presidential oversight can counter its\ninfluence. That is why the Constitution vests certain\npowers in the President that “the Legislature has no right\nto diminish or modify.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463 (J.\nMadison).6\n——————\n   5 The dissent quotes Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138 (1976) (per\n\ncuriam), for the proposition that Congress has “broad authority to\n‘create’ governmental ‘ “offices” ’ and to structure those offices ‘as it\nchooses.’ ” Post, at 2. The Buckley Court put “ ‘offices’ ” in quotes\nbecause it was actually describing legislative positions that are not\nreally offices at all (at least not under Article II). That is why the very\nnext sentence of Buckley said, “But Congress’ power . . . is inevitably\nbounded by the express language” of the Constitution. 424 U. S., at\n138–139 (emphasis added).\n   6 The dissent attributes to Madison a belief that some executive offi­\n\ncers, such as the Comptroller, could be made independent of the Presi­\ndent. See post, at 17–18. But Madison’s actual proposal, consistent\nwith his view of the Constitution, was that the Comptroller hold office\n20       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The Framers created a structure in which “[a] depend­\nence on the people” would be the “primary controul on the\ngovernment.” The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Madison).\nThat dependence is maintained, not just by “parchment\nbarriers,” id., No. 48, at 333 (same), but by letting\n“[a]mbition . . . counteract ambition,” giving each branch\n“the necessary constitutional means, and personal mo­\ntives, to resist encroachments of the others,” id., No. 51, at\n349. A key “constitutional means” vested in the Presi­\ndent—perhaps the key means—was “the power of appoint­\ning, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the\nlaws.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463. And while a government\nof “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes inhibit the\nsmooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long\nterm, structural protections against abuse of power were\ncritical to preserving liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730.\n   Calls to abandon those protections in light of “the era’s\nperceived necessity,” New York, 505 U. S., at 187, are not\nunusual. Nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise\nlimited only to the field of accounting. The failures of\naccounting regulation may be a “pressing national prob­\nlem,” but “a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional\ngovernment with each issue of comparable gravity would,\nin the long run, be far worse.” Id., at 187–188. Neither\nrespondents nor the dissent explains why the Board’s\ntask, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer\nof insulation from the President—or, for that matter, why\nonly two. The point is not to take issue with for-cause\nlimitations in general; we do not do that. The question\nhere is far more modest. We deal with the unusual situa­\n——————\nfor a term of “years, unless sooner removed by the President”; he would\nthus be “dependent upon the President, because he can be removed by\nhim,” and also “dependent upon the Senate, because they must consent\nto his [reappointment] for every term of years.” 1 Annals of Cong. 612\n(1789).\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, never before addressed by the Court, of two layers of\nfor-cause tenure. And though it may be criticized as “ele­\nmentary arithmetical logic,” post, at 23, two layers are not\nthe same as one.\n   The President has been given the power to oversee\nexecutive officers; he is not limited, as in Harry Truman’s\nlament, to “persuad[ing]” his unelected subordinates “to do\nwhat they ought to do without persuasion.” Post, at 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In its pursuit of a\n“workable government,” Congress cannot reduce the Chief\nMagistrate to a cajoler-in-chief.\n                                D\n  The United States concedes that some constraints on\nthe removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\nConstitution. See Brief for United States 47. It contends,\nhowever, that the removal restrictions at issue here do\nnot.\n  To begin with, the Government argues that the Com­\nmission’s removal power over the Board is “broad,” and\ncould be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid\ninvalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB\nBrief 22–23. But the Government does not contend that\nsimple disagreement with the Board’s policies or priorities\ncould constitute “good cause” for its removal. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 41–43, 45–46. Nor do our precedents suggest as\nmuch. Humphrey’s Executor, for example, rejected a\nremoval premised on a lack of agreement “ ‘on either the\npolicies or the administering of the Federal Trade Com­\nmission,’ ” because the FTC was designed to be “ ‘inde­\npendent in character,’ ” “free from ‘political domination or\ncontrol,’ ” and not “ ‘subject to anybody in the government’ ”\nor “ ‘to the orders of the President.’ ” 295 U. S., at 619, 625.\nAccord, Morrison, 487 U. S., at 693 (noting that “the con­\ngressional determination to limit the removal power of the\nAttorney General was essential . . . to establish the neces­\n22       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsary independence of the office”); Wiener v. United States,\n357 U. S. 349, 356 (1958) (describing for-cause removal as\n“involving the rectitude” of an officer). And here there is\njudicial review of any effort to remove Board members, see\n15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1), so the Commission will not have the\nfinal word on the propriety of its own removal orders. The\nremoval restrictions set forth in the statute mean what\nthey say.\n   Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat\nto executive control than an “ordinary” dual for-cause\nstandard. Congress enacted an unusually high standard\nthat must be met before Board members may be removed.\nA Board member cannot be removed except for willful\nviolations of the Act, Board rules, or the securities laws;\nwillful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to en­\nforce compliance—as determined in a formal Commission\norder, rendered on the record and after notice and an\nopportunity for a hearing. §7217(d)(3); see §78y(a). The\nAct does not even give the Commission power to fire Board\nmembers for violations of other laws that do not relate to\nthe Act, the securities laws, or the Board’s authority. The\nPresident might have less than full confidence in, say, a\nBoard member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery\nis not listed among the grounds for removal under\n§7217(d)(3).7\n   The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board\nmember may be removed was drawn from statutes con­\n——————\n   7 The Government implausibly argues that §7217(d)(3) “does not ex­\n\npressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,” and that\n“the Act could be construed to permit other grounds.” Brief for United\nStates 51, n. 19. But having provided in §7211(e)(6) that Board mem­\nbers are to be removed “in accordance with [§7217(d)(3)], for good cause\nshown,” Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission\nfinding in §7217(d)(3)—including formal procedures and detailed\nconditions—if Board members could also be removed without any\nfinding at all. Cf. PCAOB Brief 6 (“Cause exists where” the §7217(d)(3)\nconditions are met).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncerning private organizations like the New York Stock\nExchange. Cf. §§78s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3). While we need not\ndecide the question here, a removal standard appropriate\nfor limiting Government control over private bodies may\nbe inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power\nof the United States.\n   Alternatively, respondents portray the Act’s limitations\non removal as irrelevant, because—as the Court of Ap­\npeals held—the Commission wields “at-will removal power\nover Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F. 3d, at\n683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27–\n28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission’s general “oversight\nand enforcement authority over the Board,” §7217(a), is\nsaid to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause\nremoval,” 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no\nworse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board’s func­\ntions in the SEC’s own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.\n   Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members. The Commission\nmay, for example, approve the Board’s budget, §7219(b),\nissue binding regulations, §§7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve\nthe Board of authority, §7217(d)(1), amend Board sanc­\ntions, §7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,\n§§7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an\nagency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe­\nrior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to\nsupervise individual members if it must destroy the Board\nin order to fix it.\n   Even if Commission power over Board activities could\nsubstitute for authority over its members, we would still\nreject respondents’ premise that the Commission’s power\nin this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is\nempowered to take significant enforcement actions, and\ndoes so largely independently of the Commission. See\nsupra, at 3–4. Its powers are, of course, subject to some\nlatent Commission control. See supra, at 4–5. But the Act\n24       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnowhere gives the Commission effective power to start,\nstop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive\nactivities typically carried out by officials within the Ex­\necutive Branch.\n  The Government and the dissent suggest that the Com­\nmission could govern and direct the Board’s daily exercise\nof prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC\nrules, or by amending those of the Board. Brief for United\nStates 27; post, at 15. Enacting general rules through the\nrequired notice and comment procedures is obviously a\npoor means of micromanaging the Board’s affairs. See\n§§78s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U. S. C. §553, 15\nU. S. C. §7202(a), PCAOB Brief 24, n. 6.8 So the Govern­\nment offers another proposal, that the Commission require\nthe Board by rule to “secure SEC approval for any actions\nthat it now may take itself.” Brief for United States 27.\nThat would surely constitute one of the “limitations upon\nthe activities, functions, and operations of the Board” that\nthe Act forbids, at least without Commission findings\nequivalent to those required to fire the Board instead.\n§7217(d)(2). The Board thus has significant independence\nin determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs\nof regulated firms (and the lives of their associated per­\nsons) without Commission preapproval or direction.\n  Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is\ncontradicted by the past practice of Congress. But the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing\nsubstantial executive authority to officers protected by two\nlayers of for-cause removal—including at one level a\nsharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes “good\n——————\n  8 Contrary to the dissent’s assertions, see post, at 15–16, the Commis­\n\nsion’s powers to conduct its own investigations (with its own resources),\nto remove particular provisions of law from the Board’s bailiwick, or to\nrequire the Board to perform functions “other” than inspections and\ninvestigations, §7211(c)(5), are no more useful in directing individual\nenforcement actions.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., PCAOB Brief\n43. \tAs Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:\n     “Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe con­\n     stitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of his­\n     torical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority\n     opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as in­\n     tervenor has located any historical analogues for this\n     novel structure. They have not identified any inde­\n     pendent agency other than the PCAOB that is ap­\n     pointed by and removable only for cause by another\n     independent agency.” 537 F. 3d, at 669.\n   The dissent here suggests that other such positions\nmight exist, and complains that we do not resolve their\nstatus in this opinion. Post, at 23–31. The dissent itself,\nhowever, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal\nGovernment, see post, at 7–8, and those features discour­\nage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed\nnor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support\nits premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies\nare similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 28–31.\n   For example, many civil servants within independent\nagencies would not qualify as “Officers of the United\nStates,” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to\nthe laws of the United States,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 126.9\nThe parties here concede that Board members are execu­\ntive “Officers,” as that term is used in the Constitution.\n——————\n  9 One “may be an agent or employé working for the government and\n\npaid by it, as nine-tenths of the persons rendering service to the gov­\nernment undoubtedly are, without thereby becoming its office[r].”\nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 509 (1879). The applicable\nproportion has of course increased dramatically since 1879.\n26       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee supra, at 4; see also Art. II, §2, cl. 2. We do not decide\nthe status of other Government employees, nor do we\ndecide whether “lesser functionaries subordinate to offi­\ncers of the United States” must be subject to the same sort\nof control as those who exercise “significant authority\npursuant to the laws.” Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.\n   Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy\nthe same significant and unusual protections from Presi­\ndential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or\npolicymaking positions in government may be excepted\nfrom the competitive service to ensure Presidential con­\ntrol, see 5 U. S. C. §§2302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and\nmembers of the Senior Executive Service may be reas­\nsigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies\nmay be excluded from that Service by the President), see,\ne.g., §§3132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.\n§2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority\nis not before us, any such authority is of course wholly\nabsent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,\ntherefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what\nis colloquially known as the civil service system within\nindependent agencies.10\n   Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests\nthat today’s opinion might increase the President’s author­\n——————\n   10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset\n\nof independent agency employees who serve as administrative law\njudges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. §§556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law\njudges are necessarily “Officers of the United States” is disputed. See,\ne.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem­\nbers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform\nadjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see\n§§554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov­\nernment below refused to identify either “civil service tenure-protected\nemployees in independent agencies” or administrative law judges as\n“precedent for the PCAOB.” 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07–5127\n(CADC), pp. 32, 37–38, 42.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Without expressing any\nview whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough\nto note that we see little analogy between our Nation’s\narmed services and the Public Company Accounting Over­\nsight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi­\ndential control through the chain of command and through\nthe President’s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,\n§2, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§162, 164(g). The President\nand his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry\nor courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor\nperformance by those officers. See, e.g., §§822(a)(1),\n823(a)(1), 892(3), 933–934, 1181–1185. Here, by contrast,\nthe President has no authority to initiate a Board mem­\nber’s removal for cause.\n   There is no reason for us to address whether these\npositions identified by the dissent, or any others not at\nissue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the\nPresident’s constitutional authority. Nor is there any\nsubstance to the dissent’s concern that the “work of all\nthese various officials” will “be put on hold.” Post, at 31.\nAs the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting\ncertain officers to a single level of insulation from the\nPresident affects the conditions under which those officers\nmight some day be removed, and would have no effect,\nabsent a congressional determination to the contrary, on\nthe validity of any officer’s continuance in office. The only\nissue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the\nPresident of adequate control over the Board, which is the\nregulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement\nauthority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it\ncannot.\n                            IV\n  Petitioners’ complaint argued that the Board’s “freedom\nfrom Presidential oversight and control” rendered it “and\nall power and authority exercised by it” in violation of the\n28      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

We reject such a broad holding.\nInstead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti­\ntutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­\nder of the statute.\n   “Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional\nflaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob­\nlem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.”       Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–329 (2006). Be­\ncause “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not\nnecessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining\nprovisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation\nComm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the “normal\nrule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the\nrequired course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472\nU. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners’\nAppointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the\nexistence of the Board does not violate the separation of\npowers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed\nby §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional\ndefault rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint­\nment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,\nn. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13\nPet., at 259–260. Concluding that the removal restrictions\nare invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will, and leaves the President separated from Board\nmembers by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The\nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board’s ac­\ntions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s\nown functions to Presidential oversight.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ ‘fully operative as a\nlaw’ ” with these tenure restrictions excised.

Though this inquiry can some­\ntimes be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer\nhere seems clear: The remaining provisions are not “inca­\npable of functioning independently,” Alaska Airlines, 480\nU. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute’s text or historical\ncontext makes it “evident” that Congress, faced with the\nlimitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre­\nferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are\nremovable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.\n  It is true that the language providing for good-cause\nremoval is only one of a number of statutory provisions\nthat, working together, produce a constitutional violation.\nIn theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi­\ncient number of the Board’s responsibilities so that its\nmembers would no longer be “Officers of the United\nStates.” Or we could restrict the Board’s enforcement\npowers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory\npanel. Or the Board members could in future be made\nremovable by the President, for good cause or at will. But\nsuch editorial freedom—far more extensive than our hold­\ning today—belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\nCongress of course remains free to pursue any of these\noptions going forward.\n                             V\n  Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board\nunder the Appointments Clause. None has merit.\n  First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi­\npal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the\nSenate’s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663 (1997), that\n“[w]hether one is an ‘inferior’ officer depends on whether\nhe has a superior,” and that “ ‘inferior officers’ are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level” by\nother officers appointed by the President with the Senate’s\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsent. In particular, we noted that “[t]he power to\nremove officers” at will and without cause “is a powerful\ntool for control” of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained\nabove, the statutory restrictions on the Commission’s\npower to remove Board members are unconstitutional and\nvoid. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,\nunder the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove\nBoard members at will, and given the Commission’s other\noversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding\nthat under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi­\ncers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in\na “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].”\n   But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a “De­\npartmen[t]” like the “Executive departments” (e.g., State,\nTreasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. §101. In Freytag,\n501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques­\ntion whether a “principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi­\nties and Exchange Commission,” is a “Departmen[t]”\nunder the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,\nwould have concluded that the Commission is indeed such\na “Departmen[t],” see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), because it is a “free­\nstanding, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,”\nid., at 915.\n   Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those\nentities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief\nfor United States 37–39; PCAOB Brief 30–33, and we do.\nRespondents’ reading of the Appointments Clause is con­\nsistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of\na “department” as a “separate allotment or part of busi­\nness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are\nallotted to a particular person.” 1 N. Webster, American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995\nfacsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice\nof Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster\nGeneral to appoint “an assistant, and deputy postmasters,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat all places where such shall be found necessary,” §3, 1\nStat. 234—thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] De­\npartmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in\nthe President’s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our\nprior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment\nmade by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,\nsupra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,\n515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511\n(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo­\nnent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con­\ntained within any other such component, it constitutes a\n“Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments\nClause.11\n   But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the\nfull Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board\nmembers, because only the Chairman of the Commission\nis the Commission’s “Hea[d].”12 The Commission’s powers,\nhowever, are generally vested in the Commissioners\njointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.\n§§77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to\nthe Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive\nfunctions subject to the full Commission’s policies. See\n——————\n   11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “execu­\n\ntive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, or\nunder Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886–887 (1991).\n   12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this\n\nclaim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the\nChairman’s objection, and so petitioners’ injuries are not fairly trace­\nable to an invalid appointment. See Defendants’ Memorandum of\nPoints and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\nin Civil Action No. 1:06–cv–00217–JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42–43; Brief\nfor Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07–5127 (CADC), pp. 32–33. We\ncannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the\nsame appointments acting alone; and petitioners’ standing does not\nrequire precise proof of what the Board’s policies might have been in\nthat counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n533 (1962) (plurality opinion).\n32        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The\nChairman is also appointed from among the Commission­\ners by the President alone, id., §3, at 1266, which means\nthat he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for\npurposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S. C. §904.\n(The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet\nthe requirements of the Act, including its provision that\n“the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a com­\nmission or board with more than one member.”)13\n   As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a\nmultimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a “Depart­\nmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause neces­\nsarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts\nof Law,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,\nappoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, §2, cl. 5; id., §3,\ncl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi­\nnation of principal officers in the President to avoid the\nperceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal\nno similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose\nappointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul­\ntimember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap­\npointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.\nSee Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of\n1923, ch. 265, §2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the\ndepartment” to mean “the officer or group of officers . . .\n——————\n  13 Petitionerscontend that finding the Commission to be the head will\ninvalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,\nsuch as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.”\nReorg.

We conclude that the\nBoard members have been validly appointed by the full\nCommission.\n   In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to\nbroad injunctive relief against the Board’s continued\noperations. But they are entitled to declaratory relief\nsufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and\nauditing standards to which they are subject will be en­\nforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the\nExecutive. See Bowsher, 478 U.

That power includes, as a general matter,\nthe authority to remove those who assist him in carrying\nout his duties. Without such power, the President could\nnot be held fully accountable for discharging his own\nresponsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\nSuch diffusion of authority “would greatly diminish the\nintended and necessary responsibility of the chief magis­\ntrate himself.” The Federalist No. 70, at 478.\n  While we have sustained in certain cases limits on the\nPresident’s removal power, the Act before us imposes a\nnew type of restriction—two levels of protection from\nremoval for those who nonetheless exercise significant\nexecutive power.

It argues that granting\nthe “inferior officer[s]” on the Accounting Board “more\nthan one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the\nPresident’s ‘constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful\nexecution of the laws.’ ” Ante, at 2. I agree that the Ac\ncounting Board members are inferior officers. See ante, at\n28–29. But in my view the statute does not significantly\ninterfere with the President’s “executive Power.” Art. II,\n§1. It violates no separation-of-powers principle. And the\nCourt’s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the\nfair and efficient administration of the laws. I conse\nquently dissent.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The legal question before us arises at the intersection of\ntwo general constitutional principles. On the one hand,\nCongress has broad power to enact statutes “necessary\nand proper” to the exercise of its specifically enumerated\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

As Chief Jus\ntice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts\nto create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to\ncome.” McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (1819).\nIt embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to\nprescribe “the means by which government should, in all\nfuture time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable\nrules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi\nbility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at\nall, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority\nto “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those\noffices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138\n(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355\n(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the\npast century to create numerous federal agencies in re\nsponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have\narisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.\nWong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).\n   On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,\nand III of the Constitution separately and respectively\nvest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive\nPower” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the\nSupreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress\nmay from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,\nthese provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers\nprinciple. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–\n342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction\nin Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that\nthe Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to\nstructure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis\nsioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

S. 833, 859–860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held\nthat the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the\nPresident the authority to dismiss certain Executive\nBranch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.\n52 (1926).\n   But neither of these two principles is absolute in its\napplication to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper\nClause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu\ntive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the\nPresident. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin\nciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove\nany and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,\ndepending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or\nits subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent\nwith the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to\nremove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor\nv. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).\nAnd we must here decide whether the circumstances\nsurrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.\n   In answering the question presented, we cannot look to\nmore specific constitutional text, such as the text of the\nAppointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon\nwhich the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers\ncases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at\n124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen\neral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution\nis completely “silent with respect to the power of removal\nfrom office.” Ex parte Hennen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1839); see\nalso Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution\nstating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).\n   Nor does history offer significant help. The President’s\npower to remove Executive Branch officers “was not dis\ncussed in the Constitutional Convention.” Myers, supra,\nat 109–110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes\n4       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthat limited the President’s ability to oversee Executive\nBranch officials, including the Comptroller of the United\nStates, federal district attorneys (precursors to today’s\nUnited States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the\nSecretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By\nOur Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183–184\n(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi\ncers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B.

Rev. 211, 240–241 (1989) (hereinafter Casper); H.\nBruff, Balance of Forces: Separation of Powers in the\nAdministrative State 414–417 (2006). But those statutes\ndid not directly limit the President’s authority to remove\nany of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis\nputed” during “the early history of this government,” “and\nupon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”\nHennen, supra, at 259; see also United States ex rel.

Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin\nued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should\nbe drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also\nabout the nature of the original disagreement. Compare\nante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,\nC. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91\nCornell L.

Fisher, President\nand Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).\n   Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques\ntion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the\nprovision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—\na congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim\nited the President’s authority to remove an Executive\nBranch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly\ndisapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352\n(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis\napproved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,\nthe Court has since said that “the essence of the decision\nin Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents\nCongress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove\nor the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”\nMorrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea\nture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the\npower of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not\ngranted itself any role in removing the members of the\nAccounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa\ntion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the\ndanger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the\nexpense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com\npare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress\ngranted itself removal authority over Executive Branch\nofficial), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding\nstatute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,\nsupra (same); Morrison, supra (same).\n   In short, the question presented lies at the intersection\nof two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional\nprinciples. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent\nprovides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527\nU. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that\n“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with\njudge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53\n(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the\nCourt said that “regard must be had, as in other cases\nwhere constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat\nters of form, but to the substance of what is required.”\nThe Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in\nMorrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court\nmust look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con\ngress has done”); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689–690 (“The\nanalysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to\ndefine rigid categories of those officials who may or may\nnot be removed at will by the President,” but rather asks\nwhether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”\na removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s\nexercise of the ‘executive power’ ” (emphasis added)). The\nCourt has thereby written into law Justice Jackson’s wise\nperception that “the Constitution . . . contemplates that\npractice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka\nble government.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). See also ibid. (“The actual art of gov\nerning under our Constitution does not and cannot con\nform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its\nbranches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles\ntorn from context”).\n   It is not surprising that the Court in these circum\nstances has looked to function and context, and not to\nbright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies\nthe intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow\nthe three coordinate branches, including this Court, to\nexercise practical judgment in response to changing condi\ntions and “exigencies,” which at the time of the founding\ncould be seen only “dimly,” and perhaps not at all.\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.\n   For another, a functional approach permits Congress\nand the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory\nlaw to changing circumstances. That is why the “powers\nconferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu\ntion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for\nthe expansion of the Federal Government’s role” over time.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).\nIndeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found\ning consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu\nlation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the\nFederal Personnel System, in The Federal Government\nService 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,\nCensus Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:\nColonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,\nthe Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work\ners who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people\nliving in a society characterized by rapid technological,\neconomic, and social change. See Office of Management\nand Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.\nGovernment, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).\n   Federal statutes now require or permit Government\nofficials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not\nonly foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of\nsuch subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,\npharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,\nelectricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru\nments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,\nthe environment, fair employment practices, consumer\nprotection and much else besides. Those statutes create a\nhost of different organizational structures. Sometimes\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they\ndelegate authority to an independent commission or board,\ne.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they\nplace authority directly in the hands of a single senior\nadministrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.\n§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,\noffice, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §4048;\nsometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency\ntask groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. §§593–594; 50 U. S. C. §402\n(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis\nsions or advisory committees made up of members of more\nthan one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.\n§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes\nthey divide it among groups of departments, commissions,\nbureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and\nsometimes they permit state or local governments to\nparticipate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes\nsimilarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—\nfor example, the power to make rules, develop informal\npractices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant\nlicenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.\nSee generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.\n   The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov\nerning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast\nnumbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,\ntheir execution or administration through the work of\nadministrators organized within many different kinds of\nadministrative structures, exercising different kinds of\nadministrative authority, to achieve their legislatively\nmandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov\nernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nunits come in many different shapes and sizes.\n   The functional approach required by our precedents\nrecognizes this administrative complexity and, more im\nportantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power\noperates within this context—and the various ways in\nwhich a removal provision might affect that power. As\nhuman beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself\nto the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens’ song, some\ntimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve\na broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit\nments—such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly\nbe changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish\nment of independent administrative institutions—hold the\npotential to empower precisely because of their ability to\nconstrain. If the President seeks to regulate through\nimpartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator\nfrom removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And\nto free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal\nwithout cause can similarly help create legitimacy with\nrespect to that official’s regulatory actions by helping to\ninsulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political\npressure.\n   Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of\nelementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a\nPresident’s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule\nthat takes power from the President’s opponents may\nstrengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a\nfunctionally neutral independent authority? In that case,\nit is difficult to predict how the President’s power is af\nfected in the abstract.\n   These practical reasons not only support our precedents’\ndetermination that cases such as this should examine the\nspecific functions and context at issue; they also indicate\nthat judges should hesitate before second-guessing a “for\ncause” decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,\nChadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a “presumption that\n10      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at\n736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to\nCongress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an\ninferior understanding of the realities of administration,\nand the manner in which power, including and most espe\ncially political power, operates in context.\n  There is no indication that the two comparatively more\nexpert branches were divided in their support for the “for\ncause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em\nbodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in\nthe House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the\nSenate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation\nof the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in\nboth bodies without anyone finding in its structure any\nconstitutional problem. See id., at 12035–12037, 12112–\n12132, 12315–12323, 12372–12377, 12488–12508, 12529–\n12534, 12612–12618, 12673–12680, 12734–12751, 12915–\n12960, 13347–13354, 14439–14458, 14487–14506. The\nPresident signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a\nsigning statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the\nAct but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.\nSee President’s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002). Cf.\nABA, Report of Task Force on Presidential Signing State\nments and the Separation of Powers Doctrine 15 (2006),\nonline at http://www.signingstatementsaba_final_signing_\nstatements_recommendations-report_7-24-06.pdf (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file) (noting that President Bush\nasserted “over 500” “constitutional objections” through\nsigning statements “in his first term,” including 82 “related\nto his theory of the ‘unitary executive’ ”).\n  Thus, here, as in similar cases, we should decide the\nconstitutional question in light of the provision’s practical\nfunctioning in context. And our decision should take\naccount of the Judiciary’s comparative lack of institutional\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

In practical terms no “for\ncause” provision can, in isolation, define the full measure\nof executive power. This is because a legislative decision\nto place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the\nSecretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the\nway in which the statute defines the scope of the power\nthe relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to\nwho controls the agency’s budget requests and funding,\nthe relationships between one agency or department and\nanother, as well as more purely political factors (including\nCongress’ ability to assert influence) are more likely to\naffect the President’s power to get something done. That\nis why President Truman complained that “ ‘the powers of\nthe President amount to’ ” bringing “ ‘people in and try[ing]\nto persuade them to do what they ought to do without\npersuasion.’ ” C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154\n(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written\nthat the President “is neither dominant nor powerless” in\nhis relationships with many Government entities,\n“whether denominated executive or independent.” Strauss,\nThe Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow\ners and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 573, 583\n(1984) (hereinafter Strauss). Those entities “are all sub\nject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their\nfunctioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential\ndirection in others.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Indeed, notwithstanding the majority’s assertion that\nthe removal authority is “the key” mechanism by which\nthe President oversees inferior officers in the independent\nagencies, ante, at 20, it appears that no President has ever\n12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

See Bruff, Bringing the Inde\npendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.\nEn Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.\norg/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf\n(noting that “Presidents do not test the limits of their\npower by removing commissioners . . . ”); Lessig & Sun\nstein 110–112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to\ndefine what constitutes “cause” because Presidents rarely\ntest removal provisions).\n   But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we\nshould still conclude that the “for cause” restriction before\nus will not restrict presidential power significantly. For\none thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi\ndent’s power, but the power of an already independent\nagency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when\nit identifies its central constitutional problem: According\nto the Court, the President “is powerless to intervene” if he\nhas determined that the Board members’ “conduct merit[s]\nremoval” because “[t]hat decision is vested instead in other\ntenured officers—the Commissioners—none of whom is\nsubject to the President’s direct control.” Ante, at 14–15.\nBut so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from\nremoving the Commissioners except for cause (as the\nmajority assumes), nullifying the Commission’s power to\nremove Board members only for cause will not resolve the\nproblem the Court has identified: The President will still\nbe “powerless to intervene” by removing the Board mem\nbers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.\n   In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of\n“for cause” protection—Layer One insulating the Commis\nsioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the\nBoard from the Commissioners—impose any more serious\nlimitation upon the President’s powers than one layer.\nConsider the four scenarios that might arise:\n    1. The President and the Commission both want to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n        keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is\n        relevant.\n    2. The President and the Commission both want to\n        dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them\n        both from doing so without cause. The President’s\n        ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is\n        irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in\n        agreement.\n    3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,\n        but the Commission wants to keep the member.\n        Layer One allows the Commission to make that de\n        termination notwithstanding the President’s con\n        trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the\n        Commission does not seek to remove the Board\n        member.\n    4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but\n        the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem\n        ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it\n        hinders the Commission’s ability to dismiss a Board\n        member whom the President wants to keep in\n        place.\n  Thus, the majority’s decision to eliminate only Layer\nTwo accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a\nremoval restriction’s effect upon presidential power de\npends not on the presence of a “double-layer” of for-cause\nremoval, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real\nworld nature of the President’s relationship with the\nCommission. If the President confronts a Commission\nthat seeks to resist his policy preferences—a distinct pos\nsibility when, as here, a Commission’s membership must\nreflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. §78d(a)—the\nrestriction on the Commission’s ability to remove a Board\nmember is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may\nactually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the\nPresident faces a Commission that seeks to implement his\npolicy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndent and Commission see eye to eye.\n  In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates\ntwo alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission\nand the President both want to remove a Board member,\nbut have varying judgments as to whether they have good\n“cause” to do so—i.e., the President and the Commission\nboth conclude that a Board member should be removed,\nbut disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they\nhave both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14–15. In the\nsecond, the President wants to remove a Board member\nand the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its\nfreedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the\nPresident (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while\napparently telling the President that it agrees with him\nand would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer\nTwo as an “excuse” to pursue its actual aims—an excuse\nwhich, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.\n  Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not\nknow if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their\nlogical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And\nthe fact that, with respect to the President’s power, the\ndouble layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,\nsometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over\nall effect is at most indeterminate.\n  But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and\nview the removal provision at issue in the context of the\nentire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily\napparent. That is because the statute provides the Com\nmission with full authority and virtually comprehensive\ncontrol over all of the Board’s functions. Those who cre\nated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc\nture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod\nies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange and other similar self\nregulating organizations. See generally Brief for Former\nChairmen of the SEC as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations—\nwhich rely on private financing and on officers drawn from\nthe private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory\nauthority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed\n“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC\n2005).\n   Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac\ncounting Board the power to adopt rules and standards\n“relating to the preparation of audit reports”; to adjudicate\ndisciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that\nfail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en\ngage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec\ntions of accounting firms registered as the law requires\nand investigations to monitor compliance with the rules\nand related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. §§7211–\n7216. But, at the same time,\n    •\t No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and\n        until the Commission approves it, §7217(b)(2);\n    •\t The Commission may “abrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to”\n        any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the\n        Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission’s\n        view, doing so “further[s] the purposes” of the securi\n        ties and accounting-oversight laws, §7217(b)(5);\n    •\t The Commission may review any sanction the\n        Board imposes and “enhance, modify, cancel, re\n        duce, or require the remission of” that sanction if it\n        find’s the Board’s action not “appropriate,”\n        §§7215(e), 7217(c)(3);\n    •\t The Commission may promulgate rules restricting\n        or directing the Accounting Board’s conduct of all\n        inspections    and     investigations,   §§7211(c)(3),\n        7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);\n    •\t The Commission may itself initiate any investigation\n        or promulgate any rule within the Accounting\n        Board’s purview, §7202, and may also remove any\n16      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the\nCommission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and\nlegal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com\nmission has general supervisory powers over the Account\ning Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),\n(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”\nthat it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”\n§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author\nity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to\ninspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap\npropriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it\ncan censure the Board or its members, as well as remove\nthe members from office, if the members, for example, fail\nto enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or\nabuse the authority granted to them under the Act,\n§7217(d)(3). Cf. Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U. S. 311,\n314–319 (1903) (holding that removal authority is not\nalways “restricted to a removal for th[e] causes” set forth\nby statute); Bowsher, 478 U.

Everyone concedes that the President’s control over\nthe Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener, 357 U. S. 349;\nante, at 1–2. And if the President’s control over the Com\nmission is sufficient, and the Commission’s control over\nthe Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,\nthe President’s control over the Board should prove suffi\ncient as well.\n                               B\n   At the same time, Congress and the President had good\nreason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision.\nFirst and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15\nU. S. C. §7215. This Court has long recognized the appro\npriateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the\npersonal independence of those who even only sometimes\nengage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,\nsupra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;\nMorrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.\nUnited States, 141 U. S. 174, 191–201 (1891) (Field, J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison\nstated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu\ntive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States\n“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive\nbranch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly\nof the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;\ncf. ante, at 19, n. 6 (noting that the statute Congress ulti\n18      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The\nCourt, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory\nfunctions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at\n17–18. And when it finally does address that central\nfunction (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board\ndoes not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,\nn. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent\nwith the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing\n“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis\ntered public accounting firm, or an associated person\nthereof, should be disciplined”).\n   Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the\nAccounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,\ntechnical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring\nthat Board members “have a demonstrated” technical\n“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of\naccountants with respect to the preparation and issuance\nof audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the\n“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing\nreports require the application of “scientific accounting\nprinciples.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440\n(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional\nlegitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ\nence upon the need for technical expertise.

S. ____ (2010)             19\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Here, the justification for insulating the “technical\nexperts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to\npolitical influence is particularly strong. Congress delib\nerately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,\n148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for\ngood reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting\nBoard was created in response to “a series of celebrated\naccounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19\n(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And\nhistorically, this regulatory subject matter—financial\nregulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need\nfor independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)\n(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal\nTrade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra\ntive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold\nthe power of life and death over the great business inter\nests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .\ntaking these business matters out of politics”). And Con\ngress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres\nsional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148\nCong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).\n   In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably\nhave thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board\nmembers from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565\n(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government\nand its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,\nbut it is also critical that they appear to the public to be\navoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative\nGovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).\nAnd in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern\nment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear\npower production, the Court’s assertion that we should\nsimply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex\n20      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nperts” is, at best, unrealistic—at worst, dangerously so.\nAnte, at 18.\n                               C\n   Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict\npresidential power and so likely to further a legitimate\ninstitutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti\ntutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon\nv. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),\nthe Court made clear that when “determining whether the\nAct disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to\nwhich it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish\ning its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.\nThe Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a\nrestriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at\n691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric\ntions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s\nability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func\ntions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that\nlight”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat\ndiminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,\nbut it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to\nthe President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to\ncoordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.\nIndeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric\ntion that significantly interfered with the President’s\nimportant historic power to control criminal prosecutions,\na “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the\nconstitutionality of the present restriction would seem to\nfollow a fortiori.\n   Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re\npeatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict\nthe President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica\ntory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295\nU. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at\n17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also\nupheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with\ntechnical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special\nindependence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.\nThe Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of\nresponsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s\nadjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its\njob, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor\ntance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job\nto the public strongly justify a statute that assures that\nBoard members need not fear for their jobs when compe\ntently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the\nCommission as the ultimate authority over Board policies\nand actions. See Part II–B, supra.\n  Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way\nthat logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.\nIn Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed\nin Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,\nn. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the\nauthority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet\nengineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe\nrior officer.” The Court said,\n       “We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,\n    vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads\n    of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of\n    removal as it deems best for the public interest. The\n    constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the\n    appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and\n    regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may\n    enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per\n    kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota\n    tion marks omitted).\nSee also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi\n22      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ncer” who is appointed by a department head can be re\nstricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis\nsioners are “Heads of Departments”).\n   In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress\nmay constitutionally limit the President’s authority to\nremove certain principal officers, including heads of de\npartments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has\nconsistently recognized the validity of that holding. See\nWiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706\n(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,\nat 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,\nsupra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 410–411 (1989).\n   And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated\nin a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the\nConstitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a\nfruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court\nshould not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence\nfor the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law\nshould treat their heads as it treats other Executive\nBranch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court\nheld in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and\nrestrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom\nthey appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).\n   Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of\npowers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of\none branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of\nanother branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);\naccord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor\nrison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has\nadded that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is\nthe only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”\nremoval restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu\ntion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the\npower to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMyers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has\n“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.\nIt has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam\nple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC\nChairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the\nambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.\n   In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional\ncriteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond\nthe Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus\none is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates\na holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is\nconstitutional.\n                              D\n   We should ask one further question. Even if the “for\ncause” provision before us does not itself significantly\ninterfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize\nCongress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a\nbright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a\nseries of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,\nCongress might undercut the President’s central constitu\ntional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this\nquestion is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,\ninsofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.\nAnd in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious\nthan any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might\nbring about.\n   The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—\nan uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and\ngenerates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule\nmay not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi\ncative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac\ncounting Board performs adjudicative functions.          See\n24      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsupra, at 17–18. What, then, are we to make of the\nCourt’s potential exception? And would such an exception\napply to an administrative law judge who also has impor\ntant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,\ne.g., 8 CFR §1003.9, 34 CFR §81.4 (2009). The Court\nelsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal\nstatutes that provide for “judicial review of a[n] effort to\nremove” an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But\nwe have previously stated that all officers protected by a\nfor-cause removal provision and later subject to termina\ntion are entitled to “notice and [a] hearing” in the “courts,”\nas without such review “the appointing power” otherwise\n“could remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it\ndeemed sufficient.” Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.\n419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum\nphrey’s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging\nremoval). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,\nthen, should be given to this hint of an exception?\n   The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may\nnot apply to inferior officers who have a different relation\nship to their appointing agents than the relationship\nbetween the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,\n24–26. But the only characteristic of the “relationship”\nbetween the Commission and the Board that the Court\napparently deems relevant is that the relationship in\ncludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at\n23 (“Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members”). Why then would\nany different relationship that also includes two layers of\nfor-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.\nPart II–A, supra (describing the Commission’s near abso\nlute control over the Board). In a word, what differences\nare relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding\nin fact applies only where Congress has “enacted an un\nusually high standard” of for-cause removal—and does not\notherwise render two layers of “ ‘ordinary’ ” for-cause re\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmoval unconstitutional—I should welcome the statement.\nAnte, at 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 24–25, 15,\n22, (underscoring this statute’s “sharply circumscribed\ndefinition of what constitutes ‘good cause’ ” and its “rigor\nous,” “significant and unusual [removal] protections”).\nBut much of the majority’s opinion appears to avoid so\nnarrow a holding in favor of a broad, basically mechanical\nrule—a rule that, as I have said, is divorced from the\ncontext of the case at hand. Compare Parts III–A, III–B,\nIII–C, ante, with Parts II–A, II–B, II–C, supra. And such\na mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying\nthat, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at\nleast at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding\nby its very nature is not “a restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor” one “day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321\nU. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).\n   The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher\nent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its\nrule may not apply to “the civil service.” Ante, at 26. The\n“civil service” is defined by statute to include “all appoint\nive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,”\nexcluding the military, but including all civil “officer[s]” up\nto and including those who are subject to Senate confirma\ntion. 5 U. S. C. §§2101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil\nservice thus includes many officers indistinguishable from\nthe members of both the Commission and the Accounting\nBoard. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the\n“competitive service”—the class within the broader civil\nservice that enjoys the most robust career protection—\n“includes a vast majority of all the civil officers” in the\nUnited States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5\nU. S. C. §2102(c).\n   But even if I assume that the majority categorically\nexcludes the competitive service from the scope of its new\nrule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu\nsion would be insufficient. This is because the Court’s\n26      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are\n“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts\nand scholars have struggled for more than a century to\ndefine the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without\nmuch success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con\nstitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does\nnot seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and\nwho are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of\nthe constitution”); Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651,\n661 (1997) (“Our cases have not set forth an exclusive\ncriterion for [defining] inferior officers”); Memorandum\nfrom Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, to the General Counsels\nof the Executive Branch: Officers of the United States\nWithin the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, p. 3\n(Apr. 16, 2007) (hereinafter OLC Memo), online at\nhttp://www.justice.gov/olc/2007/appointmentsclausev10.pdf\n(“[T]he Supreme Court has not articulated the precise\nscope and application of the [Inferior Officer] Clause’s\nrequirements”); Konecke, The Appointments Clause and\nMilitary Judges: Inferior Appointment to a Principal\nOffice, 5 Seton Hall Const. L. J. 489, 492 (1995) (same);\nBurkoff, Appointment and Removal Under the Federal\nConstitution: The Impact of Buckley v. Valeo, 22 Wayne\nL. Rev. 1335, 1347, 1364 (1976) (describing our early\nprecedent as “circular” and our later law as “not particu\nlarly useful”). The Court does not clarify the concept. But\nwithout defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the\nmajority’s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or\nthe coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates. I\nunderstand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case\napproach. But here that kind of approach (when applied\nwithout more specificity than I can find in the Court’s\nopinion) threatens serious harm.\n   The problem is not simply that the term “inferior officer”\nis indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconclude that the term’s sweep is unusually broad. Con\nsider the Court’s definitions: Inferior officers are, inter\nalia, (1) those charged with “the administration and en\nforcement of the public law,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 139;\nante, at 2; (2) those granted “significant authority,” 424\nU. S., at 126; ante, at 25; (3) those with “responsibility for\nconducting civil litigation in the courts of the United\nStates,” 424 U. S., at 140; and (4) those “who can be said to\nhold an office,” United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,\n510 (1879), that has been created either by “regulations”\nor by “statute,” United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303,\n307–308 (1888).\n   Consider the definitional conclusion that the Depart\nment of Justice more recently reached: An “inferior officer”\nis anyone who holds a “continuing” position and who is\n“invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign\npowers of the federal Government,” including, inter alia,\nthe power to “arrest criminals,” “seize persons or property,”\n“issue regulations,” “issue . . . authoritative legal opin\nions,” “conduc[t] civil litigation,” “collec[t] revenue,” repre\nsent “the United States to foreign nations,” “command”\nmilitary force, or enter into “contracts” on behalf “of the\nnation.” OLC Memo 1, 4, 12–13, 15–16 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; emphasis added).\n   And consider the fact that those whom this Court has\nheld to be “officers” include: (1) a district court clerk,\nHennen, 13 Pet., at 258; (2) “thousands of clerks in the\nDepartments of the Treasury, Interior and the othe[r]”\ndepartments, Germaine, supra, at 511, who are responsi\nble for “the records, books, and papers appertaining to the\noffice,” Hennen, supra, at 259; (3) a clerk to “the assistant\ntreasurer” stationed “at Boston,” United States v.

Individual Members of the Court\nwould add to the list the Federal Communication Commis\nsion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s\n“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,\ngeneral counsels, and administrative law judges, see\nFreytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis\nsioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I\nstill see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps\nthousands of high level government officials within the\nscope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and\ntheir administrative actions and decisions constitutionally\nat risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would\nhave to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu\nreaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute\nremovable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,\nwhich I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be\nnecessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies\n(just below the top) who themselves are removable only\n“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi\ncials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They\ninclude most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (including that agency’s executive director as\nwell as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu\nlation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the\nleadership of the Social Security Administration, the\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. §§2101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high\nranking officials distinct from the “competitive service,” see\n§2101(a)(1)(C), who “serve in the key positions just below\nthe top Presidential appointees,” Office of Personnel Man\nagement, About the Senior Executive Service, online at\nhttp://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; §2102(a)(1)(C),\nand who are, without exception, subject to “removal” only for\ncause. §§7542–7543; see also §2302(a)(2) (substantially\nlimiting conditions under which “a career appointee in the\nSenior Executive Service” may be “transfer[red], or reas\nsign[ed]”). SES officials include, for example, the Director\nof the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug\nIntelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of In\nternational Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.\nSee Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Gov\nernment Affairs, United States Government Policy and\nSupporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter\nPlum Book). And by virtually any definition, essentially\nall SES officials qualify as “inferior officers,” for their\nduties, as defined by statute, require them to “direc[t] the\nwork of an organizational unit,” carry out high-level\nmanagerial functions, or “otherwise exercis[e] important\npolicy-making, policy-determining, or other executive func\ntions.” §3132(a)(2) (emphasis added). Cf. ante, at 2 (de\nscribing an “inferior officer” as someone who “determines\nthe policy and enforces the laws of the United States”);\nante, at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in\nindependent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in\nfuture cases). Is the SES exempt from today’s rule or is it\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nnot? The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be\ndifferent, simply says that it will not “addres[s]” the mat\nter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot\ndo so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the\nSES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing\nthe inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.\n   The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects\nis yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis\ntrative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.”\nFreytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, e.g.,\nid., at 881 (majority opinion) (“[A] [tax-court] special trial\njudge is an ‘inferior Officer’ ”); Edmond, supra, at 654\n(“[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] offi\ncers”). But cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. And ALJs are each re\nmovable “only for good cause established and determined\nby the Merit Systems Protection Board,” 5 U. S. C.\n§§7521(a)–(b). But the members of the Merit Systems\nProtection Board are themselves protected from removal\nby the President absent good cause. §1202(d).\n   My research reflects that the Federal Government relies\non 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in\nover 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo\nrandum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage\nment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail\nable in Clerk of Court’s case file). These ALJs adjudicate\nSocial Security benefits, employment disputes, and other\nmatters highly important to individuals.

See Dept. of Defense,\nActive Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),\nonline at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/\nrg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that\nsuch officers may not be removed from office except for\ncause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–\n632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener\nally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see\n§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career\nprotections.\n  The majority might simply say that the military is\ndifferent. But it will have to explain how it is different. It\nis difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a\nPresident who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”\nArt. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”\nmilitary “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi\ncials. See Barron & Lederman, The Commander in Chief\nat the Lowest Ebb—A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.\nL. Rev. 941, 1102–1106 (2008) (describing President’s\n“superintendence prerogative” over the military). Cf. ante,\nat 26–27 (not “expressing any view whatever” as to\nwhether military officers’ authority is now unconstitutional).\n  The majority sees “no reason . . . to address whether”\nany of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed\nunconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to\nleave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But\nwhat is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all\nthese various officials to be put on hold while the courts of\nappeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?\nWill Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi\nsions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi\ndent then restore them via executive order? And, still,\nwhat about the military? A clearer line would help avoid\nthese practical difficulties.\n  The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the\nGovernment’s ability to function while these many ques\n32      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court’s\nholding concerns only “the conditions under which th[e]se\nofficers might some day be removed.” Ante, at 27. But\nthis case was not brought by federal officials challenging\ntheir potential removal. It was brought by private indi\nviduals who were subject to regulation “ ‘here-and-now’ ”\nand who “object to the” very “existence” of the regulators\nthemselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those\nprivate individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person\nsimilarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially\nsubject to the Court’s amorphous new rule will be able to\nbring an “implied private right of action directly under the\nConstitution” “seeking . . . a declaratory judgment that”\nthe official’s actions are “unconstitutional and an injunc\ntion preventing the” official “from exercising [his] powers.”\nAnte, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.\nVelazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of\npreliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of\npowers violation); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S.\n579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Ante, at 7–10.\n   Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure\nsuch a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend\ning removal provision. For a court’s “ability to devise\n[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly”\nthe “background constitutional rules at issue” have been\n“articulated”; severance will be unavailable “in a murky\nconstitutional context,” which is precisely the context that\nthe Court’s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent\nhood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).\nMoreover, “the touchstone” of the severability analysis “is\nlegislative intent,” id., at 330, and Congress has repeat\nedly expressed its judgment “over the last century that it\nis in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that\nfederal service should depend upon meritorious perform\nance rather than political service,” Civil Service Comm’n,\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 367,\n380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional\nattention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).\nAnd so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the\nmany questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only\napply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will\nalso determine that the only available remedy to certain\ndouble for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.\n   Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the\ncontrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are\nworrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To\ninterpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few\ncircumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbi-\ntrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the\nrule more rational, but destructive.\n                                III\n  One last question: How can the Court simply assume\nwithout deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves\nare removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e\ndecide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Com-\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi-\ndent except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the\nCommissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for\ncause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the\nCourt’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I\nam not aware of any other instance in which the Court has\nsimilarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a\nconstitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that\ndefect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.\nAlabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (“We\ndo not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .\nespecially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would\n[thereby] arise”); The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refin-\ning Co., 322 U. S. 42, 46 (1944) (describing parties’ inabil-\n34      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity to “stipulate away” what “the legislation declares”).\n   It is certainly not obvious that the SEC Commissioners\nenjoy “for cause” protection. Unlike the statutes establish-\ning the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the\nstatute that established the Commission says nothing\nabout removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its\ntext is concerned, the President’s authority to remove the\nCommissioners is no different from his authority to re-\nmove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See\nShurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (“To take away th[e] power of\nremoval . . . would require very clear and explicit lan-\nguage. It should not be held to be taken away by mere\ninference or implication”); see also Memorandum from\nDavid J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel\nto the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator\nfor Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.\n23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-\nproject.pdf (“[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide\ntenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .\nsettled principles, may remove . . . without cause”); The\nConstitutional Separation of Powers Between the Presi-\ndent and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)\n(same).\n   Nor is the absence of a “for cause” provision in the stat-\nute that created the Commission likely to have been inad-\nvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9-\nyear period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby\ncast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all “for cause”\nremoval provisions, but before it decided Humphrey’s\nExecutor, which removed any doubt in respect to the con-\nstitutionality of making commissioners of independent\nagencies removable only for cause. In other words, Con-\ngress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court’s\nprecedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make\nthe Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat 9-year period, Congress created at least three major\nfederal agencies without making any of their officers\nremovable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d\n(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47\nU. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46\nStat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-\nHumphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42\nU. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after\nHumphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to\nits pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in\nstatutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49\nStat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor\nRelations Board with an explicit removal limitation).\n   The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis\nsioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to\ncreate a dependent, rather than an independent agency.\nAgency independence is a function of several different\nfactors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those\nfactors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather\nthan presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its\nseparate litigating authority, its composition as a multi\nmember bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ\nent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political\nenvironment, reflecting tradition and function, that would\nimpose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried\nto remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.\nSee generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155.\n   The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to\nagency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research\nService official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde\npendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their\nstatutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing\ncongressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s\nrule into further confusion. For not only are we left with\nout a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left\n36      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nto guess which department heads will be deemed by the\nmajority to be subject to for-cause removal notwithstand\ning statutes containing no such provision. If any agency\ndeemed “independent” will be similarly treated, the scope\nof the majority’s holding is even broader still. See Appen\ndix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).\n   The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute\nbooks a “for cause removal” phrase that does not appear in\nthe relevant statute and which Congress probably did not\nintend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not\nto uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con\nstruction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but\nits opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“It is not the habit of the\nCourt to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless\nabsolutely necessary to a decision of the case” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of\nChicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979) (“[A]n Act of Congress\nought not to be construed to violate the Constitution if any\nother possible construction remains available”).\n   I do not need to decide whether the Commissioners are\nin fact removable only “for cause” because I would uphold\nthe Accounting Board’s removal provision as constitu\ntional regardless. But were that not so, a determination\nthat the silent SEC statute means no more than it says\nwould properly avoid the determination of unconstitution\nality that the Court now makes.\n                        *     *     *\n  In my view the Court’s decision is wrong—very wrong.\nAs Parts II–A, II–B, and II–C of this opinion make clear, if\nthe Court were to look to the proper functional and contex\ntual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board\nprovision constitutional. As Part II–D shows, insofar as\nthe Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails\nto do so. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In light of the present imprecision, it must either\nnarrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually\nalone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in\nplace a broader rule of decision applicable to many other\n“inferior officers” as well. In doing the latter, it will un\ndermine the President’s authority. And it will create an\nobstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func\ntioning of that workable Government that the Constitu\ntion seeks to create—in provisions this Court is sworn to\nuphold.\n   With respect I dissent.\n38      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The chart below first lists the\n24 departments and then lists the 24 additional offices,\nboards, and bureaus.

Each of these officials is,\nunder any definition—including the Court’s—an inferior\nofficer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause\nremoval. See supra, at 25–30.\n   The data are organized into three columns: The first\ncolumn lists the “office” to which the corresponding official\nis assigned within the respective agency and, where avail\nable, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.\nsupra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger\nmaine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns\nrespectively list the career appointees in each agency who\noccupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen\neral” position is one that could be filled by either a career\nappointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current\n(career) occupant to be replaced.           See 5       U. S. C.\n§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be\nfilled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi\ntions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A\n“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a\ncareer appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general\nposition” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad\nrennial manual prepared by the congressional committees\nresponsible for government oversight.

PUBLIC COM-\n\n     PANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–861.      Argued December 7, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was\n  created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-\n  Oxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed\n  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri\n  vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry—such as\n  the New York Stock Exchange—that investigate and discipline their\n  own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi\n  zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive\n  powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au\n  dits public companies under the securities laws must register with\n  the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over\n  sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves\n  tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.\n  The parties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for con\n  stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora\n  tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are “ ‘Officers of the\n  United States’ ” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the\n  laws of the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126.\n  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board\n  members at will, but only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance\n  with” specified procedures. §§7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also\n  agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re\n  moved by the President except for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\n  malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295\n  U. S. 602, 620.\n     The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report\n  critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.\n2          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza\n    tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,\n    seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon\n    stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its\n    powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened\n    the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board\n    members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis\n    for petitioners’ challenge was that Board members were insulated\n    from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board\n    members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,\n    and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi\n    dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board’s ap\n    pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi\n    cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate’s advice and\n    consent, or—in the case of “inferior Officers”—by “the President\n    alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,”\n    Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.\n    The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary\n    judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first\n    agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the\n    dual restraints on Board members’ removal are permissible, and that\n    Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent\n    with the Appointments Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The\n Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag\n grieved party may challenge the Commission’s “final order” or “rule”\n in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. §78y. The Government reads\n §78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly\n or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis\n trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju\n risdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju\n dicial review”; if the suit is “ ‘wholly “collateral” ’ to a statute’s review\n provisions”; and if the claims are “outside the agency’s expertise.”\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212–213.\n    These considerations point against any limitation on review here.\n Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti\n tioners’ challenge is “collateral” to any Commission orders or rules\n from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti\n tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti\n tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no “meaningful” avenue of\n relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a\n sanction in order to test a law’s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen\n tech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129. Petitioners’ constitutional claims are\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Pp. 7–10.\n   2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members\ncontravene the Constitution’s separation of powers. Pp. 10–27.\n      (a) The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be\nvested in a President of the United States of America.” Art. II, §1,\ncl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower\nthe President to keep executive officers accountable—by removing\nthem from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,\n272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not\nwithout limit. In Humphrey’s Executor, supra, this Court held that\nCongress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen\ncies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the\nPresident may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in\nUnited States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487\nU. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of\nprincipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the Presi\ndent—to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not\naddressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten\nure. Pp. 10–14.\n      (b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the\nPresident’s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa\nrated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The\nPresident—or a subordinate he could remove at will—decided\nwhether the officer’s conduct merited removal under the good-cause\nstandard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re\nmoval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any\ndecision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in\nother tenured officers—the Commissioners—who are not subject to\nthe President’s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re\nmove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com\nmission fully accountable for the Board’s conduct. He can only review\nthe Commissioner’s determination of whether the Act’s rigorous good\ncause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de\ntermination, he is powerless to intervene—unless the determination\nis so unreasonable as to constitute “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 620.\n   This arrangement contradicts Article II’s vesting of the executive\npower in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or\nto attribute the Board’s failings to those whom he can oversee, the\nPresident is no longer the judge of the Board’s conduct. He can nei\nther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon\nsible for a Board member’s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re\n4          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Such diffusion of\n    power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and\n    effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the\n    blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act’s restrictions are\n    therefore incompatible with the Constitution’s separation of powers.\n    Pp. 14–17.\n         (c) The “ ‘fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven\n    ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing\n    alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. ” Bowsher\n    v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act’s multilevel tenure protections\n    provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.\n    Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of\n    fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The\n    Framers created a structure in which “[a] dependence on the people”\n    would be the “primary controul on the government,” and that de\n    pendence is maintained by giving each branch “the necessary consti\n    tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the\n    others.” The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key “constitutional means”\n    vested in the President was “the power of appointing, overseeing, and\n    controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Congress 463.\n    While a government of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes\n    inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n    51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc\n    tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving\n    liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17–21.\n         (d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con\n    straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\n    Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of\n    the Commission’s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to\n    avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission’s broad power over Board\n    functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter\n    ing the Board’s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control\n    an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board\n    members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the\n    Commission’s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board\n    may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of\n    the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no\n    tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro\n    managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids\n    any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi\n    nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub\n    stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of\n    good-cause removal.

The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the\nremainder of the statute. Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part\nof an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re\nmaining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n\nof Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the “normal rule” is “that partial . . . in\nvalidation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\n472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board’s existence does not violate the sepa\nration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by\n§§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric\ntions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains “ ‘fully\noperative as a law,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,\nand nothing in the Act’s text or historical context makes it “evident”\nthat Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose\nmembers are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to\nfunction as before, but its members may be removed at will by the\nCommission. Pp. 27–29.\n   4. The Board’s appointment is consistent with the Appointments\nClause. Pp. 29–33.\n      (a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment\nCongress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].” Infe\nrior officers “are officers whose work is directed and supervised at\nsome level” by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate’s\nconsent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663. Because\nthe good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and\nvoid, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members\nat will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members\nare therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29–30.\n      (b) The Commission is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments\nClause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi\ncally reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as”\nthe SEC, is a “Departmen[t].” The Court now adopts the reasoning of\nthe concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that\nthe SEC is such a “Departmen[t]” because it is a freestanding compo\nnent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within\nany other such component. This reading is consistent with the com\nmon, near-contemporary definition of a “department”; with the early\npractice of Congress, see §3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court’s cases,\nwhich have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of\nsuch an establishment. Pp. 30–31.\n      (c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the\nCommission’s “Hea[d].” The Commission’s powers are generally\nvested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.

Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n951 (1983). Article II vests “[t]he executive Power . . . in a\nPresident of the United States of America,” who must\n“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II,\n§1, cl. 1; id., §3. In light of “[t]he impossibility that one\nman should be able to perform all the great business of the\nState,” the Constitution provides for executive officers to\n“assist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties\nof his trust.” 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.\nFitzpatrick ed. 1939).\n  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to\nempower the President to keep these officers account­\nable—by removing them from office, if necessary. See\ngenerally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).\nThis Court has determined, however, that this authority is\nnot without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStates, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,\nunder certain circumstances, create independent agencies\nrun by principal officers appointed by the President, whom\nthe President may not remove at will but only for good\ncause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483\n(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the\nCourt sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin­\ncipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the\nPresident—to remove their own inferiors. The parties do\nnot ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we\ndo not do so.\n  We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not\nyet encountered by the Court. The question is whether\nthese separate layers of protection may be combined. May\nthe President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin­\ncipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to\nremove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer\ndetermines the policy and enforces the laws of the United\nStates?\n  We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is\ncontrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in\nthe President. The President cannot “take Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the\nfaithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the\nPresident cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than\none level of good-cause protection, even if the President\ndetermines that the officer is neglecting his duties or\ndischarging them improperly. That judgment is instead\ncommitted to another officer, who may or may not agree\nwith the President’s determination, and whom the Presi­\ndent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees\nwith him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional\nobligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”\nId., at 693.\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Among other measures, the Act introduced\ntighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board\nis composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5­\nyear terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in\nthe securities industry—such as the New York Stock\nExchange—that investigate and discipline their own\nmembers subject to Commission oversight. Congress\ncreated the Board as a private “nonprofit corporation,” and\nBoard members and employees are not considered Gov­\nernment “officer[s] or employee[s]” for statutory purposes.\n15 U. S. C. §§7211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its\nmembers and employees from the private sector by paying\nsalaries far above the standard Government pay scale.\nSee §§7211(f)(4), 7219.1\n   Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the\nBoard is a Government-created, Government-appointed\nentity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus­\ntry. Every accounting firm—both foreign and domestic—\nthat participates in auditing public companies under the\nsecurities laws must register with the Board, pay it an\nannual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.\n§§7211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is\ncharged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu­\nrities laws, the Commission’s rules, its own rules, and\nprofessional accounting standards. §§7215(b)(1), (c)(4). To\nthis end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac­\ncounting firm’s practice, including hiring and professional\n——————\n 1 The current salary for the Chairman is $673,000.

The willful violation of any Board\nrule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex­\nchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq.—\na federal crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprison­\nment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per­\nson). §§78ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.). And the Board itself\ncan issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings,\nup to and including the permanent revocation of a firm’s\nregistration, a permanent ban on a person’s associating\nwith any registered firm, and money penalties of $15\nmillion ($750,000 for a natural person). §7215(c)(4).\nDespite the provisions specifying that Board members are\nnot Government officials for statutory purposes, the par­\nties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for\nconstitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad\nPassenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 397 (1995), and that\nits members are “ ‘Officers of the United States’ ” who\n“exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of\nthe United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.

The\nCommission cannot remove Board members at will, but\nonly “for good cause shown,” “in accordance with” certain\nprocedures. §7211(e)(6).\n  Those procedures require a Commission finding, “on the\nrecord” and “after notice and opportunity for a hearing,”\nthat the Board member\n    “(A) has willfully violated any provision of th[e] Act,\n    the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;\n    “(B) has willfully abused the authority of that mem­\n    ber; or\n    “(C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has\n    failed to enforce compliance with any such provision\n    or rule, or any professional standard by any registered\n    public accounting firm or any associated person\n    thereof.” §7217(d)(3).\nRemoval of a Board member requires a formal Commis­\nsion order and is subject to judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.\n§§554(a), 556(a), 557(a), (c)(B); 15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1).\nSimilar procedures govern the Commission’s removal of\nofficers and directors of the private self-regulatory organi­\nzations. See §78s(h)(4). The parties agree that the Com­\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi­\ndent except under the Humphrey’s Executor standard of\n“inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” 295\nU.

Beckstead and Watts and\nthe Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of\nwhich the firm is a member, then sued the Board and its\nmembers, seeking (among other things) a declaratory\njudgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an in­\njunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.\nApp. 71.\n   Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers\nby conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board\nmembers without subjecting them to Presidential control.\nId., at 67–68. Petitioners also challenged the Act under\nthe Appointments Clause, which requires “Officers of the\nUnited States” to be appointed by the President with the\nSenate’s advice and consent. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The Clause\nprovides an exception for “inferior Officers,” whose ap­\npointment Congress may choose to vest “in the President\nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart­\nments.” Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC,\npetitioners argued that (1) Board members are not “infe­\nrior Officers” who may be appointed by “Heads of Depart­\nments”; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a “De­\npartmen[t]”; and (3) even if it is, the several\nCommissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its\n“Hea[d].” See App. 68–70. The United States intervened\nto defend the Act’s constitutionality. Both sides moved for\nsummary judgment; the District Court determined that it\nhad jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to re­\nspondents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–117a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 537 F. 3d 667\n(CADC 2008). It agreed that the District Court had juris­\ndiction over petitioners’ claims. Id., at 671.

It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem­\nbers’ removal are permissible because they do not “render\nthe President unable to perform his constitutional duties.”\nId., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the\nPresident “does not directly select or supervise the Board’s\nmembers,” id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre­\nhensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi­\ndent’s influence over the Commission implies a constitu­\ntionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at\n682–683. The majority also held that Board members are\ninferior officers subject to the Commission’s direction and\nsupervision, id., at 672–676, and that their appointment is\notherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at\n676–678.\n   Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case\nwas one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that\n“the double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .\ncombine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control\nover the [Board],” id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also\nargued that Board members are not effectively supervised\nby the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers\nunder the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709–712.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the District Court had juris­\ndiction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes\nproviding for judicial review of Commission action did not\nprevent the District Court from considering petitioners’\nclaims.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to\nreview any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.\n§§7217(b)(2)–(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted,\naggrieved parties may challenge “a final order of the\nCommission” or “a rule of the Commission” in a court of\nappeals under §78y, and “[n]o objection . . . may be consid­\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdic­\ntion that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. §§1331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.\nProvisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review\nunless the “statutory scheme” displays a “fairly discerni­\nble” intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue\n“are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within\nth[e] statutory structure.” Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.\nReich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates proce­\ndures “designed to permit agency expertise to be brought\nto bear on particular problems,” those procedures “are to\nbe exclusive.” Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v.\nBank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420\n(1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to\nlimit jurisdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose\nall meaningful judicial review”; if the suit is “wholly col­\nlateral to a statute’s review provisions”; and if the claims\nare “outside the agency’s expertise.” Thunder Basin,\nsupra, at 212–213 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThese considerations point against any limitation on\nreview here.\n   We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pur­\nsue their constitutional claims under the Government’s\ntheory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of\nCommission action, and not every Board action is encapsu­\nlated in a final Commission order or rule.\n   The Government suggests that petitioners could first\nhave sought Commission review of the Board’s “auditing\nstandards, registration requirements, or other rules.”\nBrief for United States 16. But petitioners object to the\nBoard’s existence, not to any of its auditing standards.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners’ general challenge to the Board is “collateral”\nto any Commission orders or rules from which review\nmight be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,\nInc., 498 U. S. 479, 491–492 (1991). Requiring petitioners\nto select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd\nprocedure for Congress to choose, especially because only\nnew rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.\nSee 15 U. S. C. §§78s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).\n  Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to\nraise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for\nUnited States 16–17. But the investigation of Beckstead\nand Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),\nand an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject\nto judicial review, see §7214(h)(2). So the Government\nproposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such\nas a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu­\nments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the\nCommission then affirms, the firm will win access to a\ncourt of appeals—and severe punishment should its chal­\nlenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to “bet\nthe farm . . . by taking the violative action” before “testing\nthe validity of the law,” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,\nInc., 549 U.

The Government does not appear to dispute\nsuch a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particu­\nlar constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g., Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.

As Madison stated on the floor\nof the First Congress, “if any power whatsoever is in its\nnature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing,\nand controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of\nCong. 463 (1789).\n   The removal of executive officers was discussed exten­\nsively in Congress when the first executive departments\nwere created. The view that “prevailed, as most consonant\nto the text of the Constitution” and “to the requisite re­\nsponsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,”\nwas that the executive power included a power to oversee\nexecutive officers through removal; because that tradi­\ntional executive power was not “expressly taken away, it\nremained with the President.” Letter from James Madi­\nson to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary\nHistory of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). “This\nDecision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty\nevidence of the Constitution’s meaning since many of the\nMembers of the First Congress had taken part in framing\nthat instrument.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–\n724 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it\nsoon became the “settled and well understood construction\nof the Constitution.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259\n(1839).\n   The landmark case of Myers v. United States reaffirmed\nthe principle that Article II confers on the President “the\ngeneral administrative control of those executing the\nlaws.” 272 U. S., at 164. It is his responsibility to take\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops\nwith the President, in Harry Truman’s famous phrase. As\nwe explained in Myers, the President therefore must have\nsome “power of removing those for whom he can not con­\ntinue to be responsible.” Id., at 117.\n   Nearly a decade later in Humphrey’s Executor, this\nCourt held that Myers did not prevent Congress from\nconferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of\n12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncertain independent agencies. That case concerned the\nmembers of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7­\nyear terms and could not be removed by the President\nexcept for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\noffice.’ ” 295 U. S., at 620 (quoting 15 U. S. C. §41). The\nCourt distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers\nconcerned “an officer [who] is merely one of the units in\nthe executive department and, hence, inherently subject to\nthe exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief\nExecutive, whose subordinate and aid he is.” 295 U. S., at\n627. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as\n“quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial” rather than “purely\nexecutive,” and held that Congress could require it “to act\n. . . independently of executive control.” Id., at 627–629.\nBecause “one who holds his office only during the pleasure\nof another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an atti­\ntude of independence against the latter’s will,” the Court\nheld that Congress had power to “fix the period during\nwhich [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to\nforbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.”\nId., at 629.\n    Humphrey’s Executor did not address the removal of\ninferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in\nheads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily\nthe department head, rather than the President, who\nenjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119,\n127; Hennen, supra, at 259–260. This Court has upheld\nfor-cause limitations on that power as well.\n    In Perkins, a naval cadet-engineer was honorably dis­\ncharged from the Navy because his services were no longer\nrequired. 116 U. S. 483. He brought a claim for his salary\nunder statutes barring his peacetime discharge except by\na court-martial or by the Secretary of the Navy “for mis­\nconduct.” Rev. Stat. §§1229, 1525. This Court adopted\nverbatim the reasoning of the Court of Claims, which had\nheld that when Congress “ ‘vests the appointment of infe­\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 485. Because Perkins had\nnot been “ ‘dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the\nsentence of a court-martial,’ ” the Court agreed that he was\n“ ‘still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.’ ” Ibid.3\n    We again considered the status of inferior officers in\nMorrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government\nAct, which provided for an independent counsel to investi­\ngate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The\ncounsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full\npowers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attor­\nney General only “ ‘for good cause.’ ” 487 U. S., at 663\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. §596(a)(1)). We recognized that the\nindependent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,\nrather than “ ‘quasi-legislative’ ” or “ ‘quasi-judicial,’ ” but\nwe stated as “our present considered view” that Congress\nhad power to impose good-cause restrictions on her re­\nmoval. 487 U. S., at 689–691. The Court noted that the\nstatute “g[a]ve the Attorney General,” an officer directly\nresponsible to the President and “through [whom]” the\nPresident could act, “several means of supervising or\ncontrolling” the independent counsel—“[m]ost importantly\n. . . the power to remove the counsel for good cause.” Id.,\nat 695–696 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under\n——————\n  3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a\n\nprincipal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. §415, and\nthe Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his\nremoval. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. §1767. This requirement\nwas widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally\nregarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,\n1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167–\n168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986).\nPerkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in\ncombination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The\nCourt of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only\nthe authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthose circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.\nMorrison did not, however, address the consequences of\nmore than one level of good-cause tenure—leaving the\nissue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, “a\nquestion of first impression” in this Court. 537 F. 3d, at\n679; see id., at 698 (dissenting opinion).\n                              B\n   As explained, we have previously upheld limited restric­\ntions on the President’s removal power. In those cases,\nhowever, only one level of protected tenure separated the\nPresident from an officer exercising executive power. It\nwas the President—or a subordinate he could remove at\nwill—who decided whether the officer’s conduct merited\nremoval under the good-cause standard.\n   The Act before us does something quite different. It not\nonly protects Board members from removal except for good\ncause, but withdraws from the President any decision on\nwhether that good cause exists. That decision is vested\ninstead in other tenured officers—the Commissioners—\nnone of whom is subject to the President’s direct control.\nThe result is a Board that is not accountable to the Presi­\ndent, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.\n   The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.\nWithout a layer of insulation between the Commission and\nthe Board, the Commission could remove a Board member\nat any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for\nwhat the Board does. The President could then hold the\nCommission to account for its supervision of the Board, to\nthe same extent that he may hold the Commission to\naccount for everything else it does.\n   A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of\nthe President’s review. Now the Commission cannot\nremove a Board member at will. The President therefore\ncannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the\nBoard’s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission accountable for everything else that it does.\nThe Commissioners are not responsible for the Board’s\nactions. They are only responsible for their own determi­\nnation of whether the Act’s rigorous good-cause standard\nis met. And even if the President disagrees with their\ndetermination, he is powerless to intervene—unless that\ndetermination is so unreasonable as to constitute “ineffi­\nciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   This novel structure does not merely add to the Board’s\nindependence, but transforms it. Neither the President,\nnor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer\nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full\ncontrol over the Board. The President is stripped of the\npower our precedents have preserved, and his ability to\nexecute the laws—by holding his subordinates accountable\nfor their conduct—is impaired.\n   That arrangement is contrary to Article II’s vesting of\nthe executive power in the President. Without the ability\nto oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board’s failings to\nthose whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the\njudge of the Board’s conduct. He is not the one who de­\ncides whether Board members are abusing their offices or\nneglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the\nlaws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a\nBoard member’s breach of faith. This violates the basic\nprinciple that the President “cannot delegate ultimate\nresponsibility or the active obligation to supervise that\ngoes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President\nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.”\nClinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 712–713 (1997) (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in judgment).4\n——————\n 4 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 12–14 (opinion of\n\nBREYER, J.), the second layer of tenure protection does compromise the\n16       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Indeed, if allowed to stand, this dispersion of responsi­\nbility could be multiplied. If Congress can shelter the\nbureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why\nnot a third? At oral argument, the Government was un­\nwilling to concede that even five layers between the Presi­\ndent and the Board would be too many. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n47–48. The officers of such an agency—safely encased\nwithin a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections—would be\nimmune from Presidential oversight, even as they exer­\ncised power in the people’s name.\n   Perhaps an individual President might find advantages\nin tying his own hands. But the separation of powers does\nnot depend on the views of individual Presidents, see\nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 879–880 (1991),\nnor on whether “the encroached-upon branch approves the\nencroachment,” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n182 (1992). The President can always choose to restrain\nhimself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot,\nhowever, choose to bind his successors by diminishing\ntheir powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his\nchoices by pretending that they are not his own.\n   The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of\naccountability. The people do not vote for the “Officers of\nthe United States.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2. They instead look to\nthe President to guide the “assistants or deputies . . .\nsubject to his superintendence.” The Federalist No. 72, p.\n——————\nPresident’s ability to remove a Board member the Commission wants to\nretain. Without a second layer of protection, the Commission has no\nexcuse for retaining an officer who is not faithfully executing the law.\nWith the second layer in place, the Commission can shield its decision\nfrom Presidential review by finding that good cause is absent—a\nfinding that, given the Commission’s own protected tenure, the Presi­\ndent cannot easily overturn. The dissent describes this conflict merely\nas one of four possible “scenarios,” see post, at 12–13, but it is the\ncentral issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the\nPresident finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and\na statute prevents him from doing so.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n487 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). Without a clear\nand effective chain of command, the public cannot “deter­\nmine on whom the blame or the punishment of a perni­\ncious measure, or series of pernicious measures ought\nreally to fall.” Id., No. 70, at 476 (same). That is why the\nFramers sought to ensure that “those who are employed in\nthe execution of the law will be in their proper situation,\nand the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest\nofficers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as\nthey ought, on the President, and the President on the\ncommunity.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).\n   By granting the Board executive power without the\nExecutive’s oversight, this Act subverts the President’s\nability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed—as\nwell as the public’s ability to pass judgment on his efforts.\nThe Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitu­\ntion’s separation of powers.\n                              C\n   Respondents and the dissent resist this conclusion,\nportraying the Board as “the kind of practical accommoda­\ntion between the Legislature and the Executive that\nshould be permitted in a ‘workable government.’ ” Metro\npolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for\nAbatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276 (1991)\n(MWAA) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Saw\nyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring));\nsee, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). According to\nthe dissent, Congress may impose multiple levels of for­\ncause tenure between the President and his subordinates\nwhen it “rests agency independence upon the need for\ntechnical expertise.” Post, at 18. The Board’s mission is\nsaid to demand both “technical competence” and “apolitical\nexpertise,” and its powers may only be exercised by “tech­\nnical professional experts.” Post, at 18 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In this respect the statute creating the\n18      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBoard is, we are told, simply one example of the “vast\nnumbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,\nconcerned with vast numbers of different problems, [that]\nprovide for, or foresee, their execution or administration\nthrough the work of administrators organized within\nmany different kinds of administrative structures, exercis­\ning different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve\ntheir legislatively mandated objectives.” Post, at 8.\n    No one doubts Congress’s power to create a vast and\nvaried federal bureaucracy. But where, in all this, is the\nrole for oversight by an elected President? The Constitu­\ntion requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation\noversee the execution of the laws. And the “ ‘fact that a\ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful\nin facilitating functions of government, standing alone,\nwill not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,’ ” for\n“ ‘[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objec­\ntives—or the hallmarks—of democratic government.’ ”\nBowsher, 478 U. S., at 736 (quoting Chadha, 462 U. S., at\n944).\n    One can have a government that functions without\nbeing ruled by functionaries, and a government that bene­\nfits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our\nConstitution was adopted to enable the people to govern\nthemselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of\nthe Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and\ntouches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the\nconcern that it may slip from the Executive’s control, and\nthus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab­\nsent from the dissent’s paean to the administrative state.\n    For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of\nremoval as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi­\ndent’s “power to get something done” more often depends\non “who controls the agency’s budget requests and fund­\ning, the relationships between one agency or department\nand another, . . . purely political factors (including Con­\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Post, at 11, 13 (emphasis deleted). The\nFramers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic\nminutiae. As we said in Bowsher, supra, at 730, “[t]he\nseparated powers of our Government cannot be permitted\nto turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exer­\ncising executive power is on good terms with Congress.”\n   In fact, the multilevel protection that the dissent en­\ndorses “provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the\nlegislative power.” MWAA, supra, at 277. In a system of\nchecks and balances, “[p]ower abhors a vacuum,” and one\nbranch’s handicap is another’s strength. 537 F. 3d, at 695,\nn. 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Even when a branch does not arrogate power to\nitself,” therefore, it must not “impair another in the per­\nformance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996).5 Congress has plenary\ncontrol over the salary, duties, and even existence of ex­\necutive offices. Only Presidential oversight can counter its\ninfluence. That is why the Constitution vests certain\npowers in the President that “the Legislature has no right\nto diminish or modify.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463 (J.\nMadison).6\n——————\n   5 The dissent quotes Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138 (1976) (per\n\ncuriam), for the proposition that Congress has “broad authority to\n‘create’ governmental ‘ “offices” ’ and to structure those offices ‘as it\nchooses.’ ” Post, at 2. The Buckley Court put “ ‘offices’ ” in quotes\nbecause it was actually describing legislative positions that are not\nreally offices at all (at least not under Article II). That is why the very\nnext sentence of Buckley said, “But Congress’ power . . . is inevitably\nbounded by the express language” of the Constitution. 424 U. S., at\n138–139 (emphasis added).\n   6 The dissent attributes to Madison a belief that some executive offi­\n\ncers, such as the Comptroller, could be made independent of the Presi­\ndent. See post, at 17–18. But Madison’s actual proposal, consistent\nwith his view of the Constitution, was that the Comptroller hold office\n20       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The Framers created a structure in which “[a] depend­\nence on the people” would be the “primary controul on the\ngovernment.” The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Madison).\nThat dependence is maintained, not just by “parchment\nbarriers,” id., No. 48, at 333 (same), but by letting\n“[a]mbition . . . counteract ambition,” giving each branch\n“the necessary constitutional means, and personal mo­\ntives, to resist encroachments of the others,” id., No. 51, at\n349. A key “constitutional means” vested in the Presi­\ndent—perhaps the key means—was “the power of appoint­\ning, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the\nlaws.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463. And while a government\nof “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes inhibit the\nsmooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.\n51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long\nterm, structural protections against abuse of power were\ncritical to preserving liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730.\n   Calls to abandon those protections in light of “the era’s\nperceived necessity,” New York, 505 U. S., at 187, are not\nunusual. Nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise\nlimited only to the field of accounting. The failures of\naccounting regulation may be a “pressing national prob­\nlem,” but “a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional\ngovernment with each issue of comparable gravity would,\nin the long run, be far worse.” Id., at 187–188. Neither\nrespondents nor the dissent explains why the Board’s\ntask, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer\nof insulation from the President—or, for that matter, why\nonly two. The point is not to take issue with for-cause\nlimitations in general; we do not do that. The question\nhere is far more modest. We deal with the unusual situa­\n——————\nfor a term of “years, unless sooner removed by the President”; he would\nthus be “dependent upon the President, because he can be removed by\nhim,” and also “dependent upon the Senate, because they must consent\nto his [reappointment] for every term of years.” 1 Annals of Cong. 612\n(1789).\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

And though it may be criticized as “ele­\nmentary arithmetical logic,” post, at 23, two layers are not\nthe same as one.\n   The President has been given the power to oversee\nexecutive officers; he is not limited, as in Harry Truman’s\nlament, to “persuad[ing]” his unelected subordinates “to do\nwhat they ought to do without persuasion.” Post, at 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In its pursuit of a\n“workable government,” Congress cannot reduce the Chief\nMagistrate to a cajoler-in-chief.\n                                D\n  The United States concedes that some constraints on\nthe removal of inferior executive officers might violate the\nConstitution. See Brief for United States 47. It contends,\nhowever, that the removal restrictions at issue here do\nnot.\n  To begin with, the Government argues that the Com­\nmission’s removal power over the Board is “broad,” and\ncould be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid\ninvalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB\nBrief 22–23. But the Government does not contend that\nsimple disagreement with the Board’s policies or priorities\ncould constitute “good cause” for its removal. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 41–43, 45–46. Nor do our precedents suggest as\nmuch. Humphrey’s Executor, for example, rejected a\nremoval premised on a lack of agreement “ ‘on either the\npolicies or the administering of the Federal Trade Com­\nmission,’ ” because the FTC was designed to be “ ‘inde­\npendent in character,’ ” “free from ‘political domination or\ncontrol,’ ” and not “ ‘subject to anybody in the government’ ”\nor “ ‘to the orders of the President.’ ” 295 U. S., at 619, 625.\nAccord, Morrison, 487 U. S., at 693 (noting that “the con­\ngressional determination to limit the removal power of the\nAttorney General was essential . . . to establish the neces­\n22       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsary independence of the office”); Wiener v. United States,\n357 U. S. 349, 356 (1958) (describing for-cause removal as\n“involving the rectitude” of an officer). And here there is\njudicial review of any effort to remove Board members, see\n15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1), so the Commission will not have the\nfinal word on the propriety of its own removal orders. The\nremoval restrictions set forth in the statute mean what\nthey say.\n   Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat\nto executive control than an “ordinary” dual for-cause\nstandard. Congress enacted an unusually high standard\nthat must be met before Board members may be removed.\nA Board member cannot be removed except for willful\nviolations of the Act, Board rules, or the securities laws;\nwillful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to en­\nforce compliance—as determined in a formal Commission\norder, rendered on the record and after notice and an\nopportunity for a hearing. §7217(d)(3); see §78y(a). The\nAct does not even give the Commission power to fire Board\nmembers for violations of other laws that do not relate to\nthe Act, the securities laws, or the Board’s authority. The\nPresident might have less than full confidence in, say, a\nBoard member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery\nis not listed among the grounds for removal under\n§7217(d)(3).7\n   The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board\nmember may be removed was drawn from statutes con­\n——————\n   7 The Government implausibly argues that §7217(d)(3) “does not ex­\n\npressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,” and that\n“the Act could be construed to permit other grounds.” Brief for United\nStates 51, n. 19. But having provided in §7211(e)(6) that Board mem­\nbers are to be removed “in accordance with [§7217(d)(3)], for good cause\nshown,” Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission\nfinding in §7217(d)(3)—including formal procedures and detailed\nconditions—if Board members could also be removed without any\nfinding at all. Cf. PCAOB Brief 6 (“Cause exists where” the §7217(d)(3)\nconditions are met).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncerning private organizations like the New York Stock\nExchange. Cf. §§78s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3). While we need not\ndecide the question here, a removal standard appropriate\nfor limiting Government control over private bodies may\nbe inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power\nof the United States.\n   Alternatively, respondents portray the Act’s limitations\non removal as irrelevant, because—as the Court of Ap­\npeals held—the Commission wields “at-will removal power\nover Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F. 3d, at\n683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27–\n28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission’s general “oversight\nand enforcement authority over the Board,” §7217(a), is\nsaid to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause\nremoval,” 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no\nworse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board’s func­\ntions in the SEC’s own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.\n   Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members. The Commission\nmay, for example, approve the Board’s budget, §7219(b),\nissue binding regulations, §§7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve\nthe Board of authority, §7217(d)(1), amend Board sanc­\ntions, §7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,\n§§7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an\nagency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe­\nrior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to\nsupervise individual members if it must destroy the Board\nin order to fix it.\n   Even if Commission power over Board activities could\nsubstitute for authority over its members, we would still\nreject respondents’ premise that the Commission’s power\nin this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is\nempowered to take significant enforcement actions, and\ndoes so largely independently of the Commission. See\nsupra, at 3–4. Its powers are, of course, subject to some\nlatent Commission control. See supra, at 4–5. But the Act\n24       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnowhere gives the Commission effective power to start,\nstop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive\nactivities typically carried out by officials within the Ex­\necutive Branch.\n  The Government and the dissent suggest that the Com­\nmission could govern and direct the Board’s daily exercise\nof prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC\nrules, or by amending those of the Board. Brief for United\nStates 27; post, at 15. Enacting general rules through the\nrequired notice and comment procedures is obviously a\npoor means of micromanaging the Board’s affairs. See\n§§78s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U. S. C. §553, 15\nU. S. C. §7202(a), PCAOB Brief 24, n. 6.8 So the Govern­\nment offers another proposal, that the Commission require\nthe Board by rule to “secure SEC approval for any actions\nthat it now may take itself.” Brief for United States 27.\nThat would surely constitute one of the “limitations upon\nthe activities, functions, and operations of the Board” that\nthe Act forbids, at least without Commission findings\nequivalent to those required to fire the Board instead.\n§7217(d)(2). The Board thus has significant independence\nin determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs\nof regulated firms (and the lives of their associated per­\nsons) without Commission preapproval or direction.\n  Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is\ncontradicted by the past practice of Congress. But the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing\nsubstantial executive authority to officers protected by two\nlayers of for-cause removal—including at one level a\nsharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes “good\n——————\n  8 Contrary to the dissent’s assertions, see post, at 15–16, the Commis­\n\nsion’s powers to conduct its own investigations (with its own resources),\nto remove particular provisions of law from the Board’s bailiwick, or to\nrequire the Board to perform functions “other” than inspections and\ninvestigations, §7211(c)(5), are no more useful in directing individual\nenforcement actions.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., PCAOB Brief\n43. \tAs Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:\n     “Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe con­\n     stitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of his­\n     torical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority\n     opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as in­\n     tervenor has located any historical analogues for this\n     novel structure. They have not identified any inde­\n     pendent agency other than the PCAOB that is ap­\n     pointed by and removable only for cause by another\n     independent agency.” 537 F. 3d, at 669.\n   The dissent here suggests that other such positions\nmight exist, and complains that we do not resolve their\nstatus in this opinion. Post, at 23–31. The dissent itself,\nhowever, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal\nGovernment, see post, at 7–8, and those features discour­\nage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed\nnor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support\nits premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies\nare similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 28–31.\n   For example, many civil servants within independent\nagencies would not qualify as “Officers of the United\nStates,” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to\nthe laws of the United States,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 126.9\nThe parties here concede that Board members are execu­\ntive “Officers,” as that term is used in the Constitution.\n——————\n  9 One “may be an agent or employé working for the government and\n\npaid by it, as nine-tenths of the persons rendering service to the gov­\nernment undoubtedly are, without thereby becoming its office[r].”\nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 509 (1879). The applicable\nproportion has of course increased dramatically since 1879.\n26       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee supra, at 4; see also Art. II, §2, cl. 2. We do not decide\nthe status of other Government employees, nor do we\ndecide whether “lesser functionaries subordinate to offi­\ncers of the United States” must be subject to the same sort\nof control as those who exercise “significant authority\npursuant to the laws.” Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.\n   Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy\nthe same significant and unusual protections from Presi­\ndential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or\npolicymaking positions in government may be excepted\nfrom the competitive service to ensure Presidential con­\ntrol, see 5 U. S. C. §§2302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and\nmembers of the Senior Executive Service may be reas­\nsigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies\nmay be excluded from that Service by the President), see,\ne.g., §§3132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.\n§2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority\nis not before us, any such authority is of course wholly\nabsent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,\ntherefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what\nis colloquially known as the civil service system within\nindependent agencies.10\n   Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests\nthat today’s opinion might increase the President’s author­\n——————\n   10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset\n\nof independent agency employees who serve as administrative law\njudges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. §§556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law\njudges are necessarily “Officers of the United States” is disputed. See,\ne.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem­\nbers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform\nadjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see\n§§554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov­\nernment below refused to identify either “civil service tenure-protected\nemployees in independent agencies” or administrative law judges as\n“precedent for the PCAOB.” 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07–5127\n(CADC), pp. 32, 37–38, 42.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity to remove military officers. Without expressing any\nview whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough\nto note that we see little analogy between our Nation’s\narmed services and the Public Company Accounting Over­\nsight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi­\ndential control through the chain of command and through\nthe President’s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,\n§2, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§162, 164(g). The President\nand his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry\nor courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor\nperformance by those officers. See, e.g., §§822(a)(1),\n823(a)(1), 892(3), 933–934, 1181–1185. Here, by contrast,\nthe President has no authority to initiate a Board mem­\nber’s removal for cause.\n   There is no reason for us to address whether these\npositions identified by the dissent, or any others not at\nissue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the\nPresident’s constitutional authority. Nor is there any\nsubstance to the dissent’s concern that the “work of all\nthese various officials” will “be put on hold.” Post, at 31.\nAs the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting\ncertain officers to a single level of insulation from the\nPresident affects the conditions under which those officers\nmight some day be removed, and would have no effect,\nabsent a congressional determination to the contrary, on\nthe validity of any officer’s continuance in office. The only\nissue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the\nPresident of adequate control over the Board, which is the\nregulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement\nauthority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it\ncannot.\n                            IV\n  Petitioners’ complaint argued that the Board’s “freedom\nfrom Presidential oversight and control” rendered it “and\nall power and authority exercised by it” in violation of the\n28      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

We reject such a broad holding.\nInstead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti­\ntutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­\nder of the statute.\n   “Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional\nflaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob­\nlem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.”       Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–329 (2006). Be­\ncause “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not\nnecessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining\nprovisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation\nComm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the “normal\nrule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the\nrequired course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472\nU. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners’\nAppointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the\nexistence of the Board does not violate the separation of\npowers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed\nby §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional\ndefault rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint­\nment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,\nn. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13\nPet., at 259–260. Concluding that the removal restrictions\nare invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission\nat will, and leaves the President separated from Board\nmembers by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The\nCommission is then fully responsible for the Board’s ac­\ntions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s\nown functions to Presidential oversight.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ ‘fully operative as a\nlaw’ ” with these tenure restrictions excised. New York,\n505 U. S., at 186 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,\n480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its\nremaining provisions “[u]nless it is evident that the Legis­\nlature would not have enacted those provisions . . . inde­\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Though this inquiry can some­\ntimes be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer\nhere seems clear: The remaining provisions are not “inca­\npable of functioning independently,” Alaska Airlines, 480\nU. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute’s text or historical\ncontext makes it “evident” that Congress, faced with the\nlimitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre­\nferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are\nremovable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.\n  It is true that the language providing for good-cause\nremoval is only one of a number of statutory provisions\nthat, working together, produce a constitutional violation.\nIn theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi­\ncient number of the Board’s responsibilities so that its\nmembers would no longer be “Officers of the United\nStates.” Or we could restrict the Board’s enforcement\npowers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory\npanel. Or the Board members could in future be made\nremovable by the President, for good cause or at will. But\nsuch editorial freedom—far more extensive than our hold­\ning today—belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\nCongress of course remains free to pursue any of these\noptions going forward.\n                             V\n  Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board\nunder the Appointments Clause. None has merit.\n  First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi­\npal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the\nSenate’s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663 (1997), that\n“[w]hether one is an ‘inferior’ officer depends on whether\nhe has a superior,” and that “ ‘inferior officers’ are officers\nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level” by\nother officers appointed by the President with the Senate’s\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsent. In particular, we noted that “[t]he power to\nremove officers” at will and without cause “is a powerful\ntool for control” of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained\nabove, the statutory restrictions on the Commission’s\npower to remove Board members are unconstitutional and\nvoid. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,\nunder the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove\nBoard members at will, and given the Commission’s other\noversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding\nthat under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi­\ncers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in\na “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].”\n   But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a “De­\npartmen[t]” like the “Executive departments” (e.g., State,\nTreasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. §101. In Freytag,\n501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques­\ntion whether a “principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi­\nties and Exchange Commission,” is a “Departmen[t]”\nunder the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,\nwould have concluded that the Commission is indeed such\na “Departmen[t],” see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), because it is a “free­\nstanding, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,”\nid., at 915.\n   Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those\nentities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief\nfor United States 37–39; PCAOB Brief 30–33, and we do.\nRespondents’ reading of the Appointments Clause is con­\nsistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of\na “department” as a “separate allotment or part of busi­\nness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are\nallotted to a particular person.” 1 N. Webster, American\nDictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995\nfacsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice\nof Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster\nGeneral to appoint “an assistant, and deputy postmasters,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat all places where such shall be found necessary,” §3, 1\nStat. 234—thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] De­\npartmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in\nthe President’s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our\nprior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment\nmade by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,\nsupra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,\n515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511\n(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo­\nnent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con­\ntained within any other such component, it constitutes a\n“Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments\nClause.11\n   But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the\nfull Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board\nmembers, because only the Chairman of the Commission\nis the Commission’s “Hea[d].”12 The Commission’s powers,\nhowever, are generally vested in the Commissioners\njointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.\n§§77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to\nthe Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive\nfunctions subject to the full Commission’s policies. See\n——————\n   11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “execu­\n\ntive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, or\nunder Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.\nCommissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886–887 (1991).\n   12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this\n\nclaim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the\nChairman’s objection, and so petitioners’ injuries are not fairly trace­\nable to an invalid appointment. See Defendants’ Memorandum of\nPoints and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\nin Civil Action No. 1:06–cv–00217–JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42–43; Brief\nfor Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07–5127 (CADC), pp. 32–33. We\ncannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the\nsame appointments acting alone; and petitioners’ standing does not\nrequire precise proof of what the Board’s policies might have been in\nthat counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,\n533 (1962) (plurality opinion).\n32        FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The\nChairman is also appointed from among the Commission­\ners by the President alone, id., §3, at 1266, which means\nthat he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for\npurposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S. C. §904.\n(The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet\nthe requirements of the Act, including its provision that\n“the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a com­\nmission or board with more than one member.”)13\n   As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a\nmultimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a “Depart­\nmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause neces­\nsarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts\nof Law,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,\nappoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, §2, cl. 5; id., §3,\ncl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi­\nnation of principal officers in the President to avoid the\nperceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal\nno similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose\nappointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul­\ntimember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap­\npointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.\nSee Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of\n1923, ch. 265, §2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the\ndepartment” to mean “the officer or group of officers . . .\n——————\n  13 Petitionerscontend that finding the Commission to be the head will\ninvalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,\nsuch as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.”\nReorg.

We conclude that the\nBoard members have been validly appointed by the full\nCommission.\n   In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to\nbroad injunctive relief against the Board’s continued\noperations. But they are entitled to declaratory relief\nsufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and\nauditing standards to which they are subject will be en­\nforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the\nExecutive. See Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 727, n. 5 (conclud­\ning that a separation of powers violation may create a\n“here-and-now” injury that can be remedied by a court\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                       *     *    *\n  The Constitution that makes the President accountable\nto the people for executing the laws also gives him the\npower to do so. That power includes, as a general matter,\nthe authority to remove those who assist him in carrying\nout his duties. Without such power, the President could\nnot be held fully accountable for discharging his own\nresponsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\nSuch diffusion of authority “would greatly diminish the\nintended and necessary responsibility of the chief magis­\ntrate himself.” The Federalist No. 70, at 478.\n  While we have sustained in certain cases limits on the\nPresident’s removal power, the Act before us imposes a\nnew type of restriction—two levels of protection from\nremoval for those who nonetheless exercise significant\nexecutive power.

It argues that granting\nthe “inferior officer[s]” on the Accounting Board “more\nthan one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the\nPresident’s ‘constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful\nexecution of the laws.’ ” Ante, at 2. I agree that the Ac\ncounting Board members are inferior officers. See ante, at\n28–29. But in my view the statute does not significantly\ninterfere with the President’s “executive Power.” Art. II,\n§1. It violates no separation-of-powers principle. And the\nCourt’s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the\nfair and efficient administration of the laws. I conse\nquently dissent.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The legal question before us arises at the intersection of\ntwo general constitutional principles. On the one hand,\nCongress has broad power to enact statutes “necessary\nand proper” to the exercise of its specifically enumerated\n2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nconstitutional authority. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As Chief Jus\ntice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts\nto create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to\ncome.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).\nIt embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to\nprescribe “the means by which government should, in all\nfuture time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable\nrules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi\nbility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at\nall, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority\nto “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those\noffices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138\n(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355\n(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the\npast century to create numerous federal agencies in re\nsponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have\narisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.\nWong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).\n   On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,\nand III of the Constitution separately and respectively\nvest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive\nPower” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the\nSupreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress\nmay from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,\nthese provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers\nprinciple. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–\n342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction\nin Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that\nthe Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to\nstructure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis\nsioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 64\n(1982); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 833, 859–860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held\nthat the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the\nPresident the authority to dismiss certain Executive\nBranch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.\n52 (1926).\n   But neither of these two principles is absolute in its\napplication to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper\nClause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu\ntive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the\nPresident. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin\nciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove\nany and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,\ndepending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or\nits subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent\nwith the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to\nremove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor\nv. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).\nAnd we must here decide whether the circumstances\nsurrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.\n   In answering the question presented, we cannot look to\nmore specific constitutional text, such as the text of the\nAppointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon\nwhich the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers\ncases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at\n124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen\neral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution\nis completely “silent with respect to the power of removal\nfrom office.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see\nalso Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution\nstating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).\n   Nor does history offer significant help. The President’s\npower to remove Executive Branch officers “was not dis\ncussed in the Constitutional Convention.” Myers, supra,\nat 109–110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes\n4       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthat limited the President’s ability to oversee Executive\nBranch officials, including the Comptroller of the United\nStates, federal district attorneys (precursors to today’s\nUnited States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the\nSecretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By\nOur Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183–184\n(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi\ncers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B. U. L.\nRev. 59, 74–75 (1983); Casper, An Essay in Separation of\nPowers: Some Early Versions and Practices, 30 Wm. &\nMary L. Rev. 211, 240–241 (1989) (hereinafter Casper); H.\nBruff, Balance of Forces: Separation of Powers in the\nAdministrative State 414–417 (2006). But those statutes\ndid not directly limit the President’s authority to remove\nany of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis\nputed” during “the early history of this government,” “and\nupon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”\nHennen, supra, at 259; see also United States ex rel. Good\nrich v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, 306 (1855) (McLean, J.,\ndissenting); Casper 233–237 (recounting the Debate of\n1789). Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin\nued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should\nbe drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also\nabout the nature of the original disagreement. Compare\nante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,\nC. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91\nCornell L. Rev. 1021 (2006), with, e.g., Myers, supra, at\n194 (McReynolds, J., dissenting); Corwin, Tenure of Office\nand the Removal Power Under the Constitution, 27 Colum.\nL. Rev. 353, 369 (1927); Lessig & Sunstein, The President\nand the Administration, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 25–26 (1994)\n(hereinafter Lessig & Sunstein); and L. Fisher, President\nand Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).\n   Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques\ntion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the\nprovision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—\na congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim\nited the President’s authority to remove an Executive\nBranch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly\ndisapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part\nMyers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352\n(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis\napproved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,\nthe Court has since said that “the essence of the decision\nin Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents\nCongress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove\nor the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”\nMorrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea\nture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the\npower of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not\ngranted itself any role in removing the members of the\nAccounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa\ntion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the\ndanger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the\nexpense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com\npare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress\ngranted itself removal authority over Executive Branch\nofficial), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding\nstatute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,\nsupra (same); Morrison, supra (same).\n   In short, the question presented lies at the intersection\nof two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional\nprinciples. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent\nprovides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527\nU. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that\n“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with\njudge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the\n6       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nlanguage” of the Constitution (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n                             B\n   When previously deciding this kind of nontextual ques\ntion, the Court has emphasized the importance of examin\ning how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely\nto function. Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53\n(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the\nCourt said that “regard must be had, as in other cases\nwhere constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat\nters of form, but to the substance of what is required.”\nThe Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in\nMorrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court\nmust look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con\ngress has done”); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689–690 (“The\nanalysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to\ndefine rigid categories of those officials who may or may\nnot be removed at will by the President,” but rather asks\nwhether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”\na removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s\nexercise of the ‘executive power’ ” (emphasis added)). The\nCourt has thereby written into law Justice Jackson’s wise\nperception that “the Constitution . . . contemplates that\npractice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka\nble government.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). See also ibid. (“The actual art of gov\nerning under our Constitution does not and cannot con\nform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its\nbranches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles\ntorn from context”).\n   It is not surprising that the Court in these circum\nstances has looked to function and context, and not to\nbright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies\nthe intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow\nthe three coordinate branches, including this Court, to\nexercise practical judgment in response to changing condi\ntions and “exigencies,” which at the time of the founding\ncould be seen only “dimly,” and perhaps not at all.\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.\n   For another, a functional approach permits Congress\nand the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory\nlaw to changing circumstances. That is why the “powers\nconferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu\ntion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for\nthe expansion of the Federal Government’s role” over time.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).\nIndeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found\ning consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu\nlation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the\nFederal Personnel System, in The Federal Government\nService 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,\nCensus Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:\nColonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,\nthe Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work\ners who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people\nliving in a society characterized by rapid technological,\neconomic, and social change. See Office of Management\nand Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.\nGovernment, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).\n   Federal statutes now require or permit Government\nofficials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not\nonly foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of\nsuch subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,\npharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,\nelectricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru\nments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,\nthe environment, fair employment practices, consumer\nprotection and much else besides. Those statutes create a\nhost of different organizational structures. Sometimes\n8       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

C. §2031(a)(1); 42 U. S. C. §5192(c);\nsometimes they place authority in a long-established\nCabinet department, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §1637b(c)(1); 12\nU. S. C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they\ndelegate authority to an independent commission or board,\ne.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they\nplace authority directly in the hands of a single senior\nadministrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.\n§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,\noffice, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §4048;\nsometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency\ntask groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. §§593–594; 50 U. S. C. §402\n(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis\nsions or advisory committees made up of members of more\nthan one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.\n§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes\nthey divide it among groups of departments, commissions,\nbureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and\nsometimes they permit state or local governments to\nparticipate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes\nsimilarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—\nfor example, the power to make rules, develop informal\npractices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant\nlicenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.\nSee generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.\n   The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov\nerning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast\nnumbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,\ntheir execution or administration through the work of\nadministrators organized within many different kinds of\nadministrative structures, exercising different kinds of\nadministrative authority, to achieve their legislatively\nmandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov\nernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nunits come in many different shapes and sizes.\n   The functional approach required by our precedents\nrecognizes this administrative complexity and, more im\nportantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power\noperates within this context—and the various ways in\nwhich a removal provision might affect that power. As\nhuman beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself\nto the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens’ song, some\ntimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve\na broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit\nments—such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly\nbe changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish\nment of independent administrative institutions—hold the\npotential to empower precisely because of their ability to\nconstrain. If the President seeks to regulate through\nimpartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator\nfrom removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And\nto free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal\nwithout cause can similarly help create legitimacy with\nrespect to that official’s regulatory actions by helping to\ninsulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political\npressure.\n   Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of\nelementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a\nPresident’s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule\nthat takes power from the President’s opponents may\nstrengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a\nfunctionally neutral independent authority? In that case,\nit is difficult to predict how the President’s power is af\nfected in the abstract.\n   These practical reasons not only support our precedents’\ndetermination that cases such as this should examine the\nspecific functions and context at issue; they also indicate\nthat judges should hesitate before second-guessing a “for\ncause” decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,\nChadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a “presumption that\n10      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at\n736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to\nCongress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an\ninferior understanding of the realities of administration,\nand the manner in which power, including and most espe\ncially political power, operates in context.\n  There is no indication that the two comparatively more\nexpert branches were divided in their support for the “for\ncause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em\nbodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in\nthe House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the\nSenate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation\nof the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in\nboth bodies without anyone finding in its structure any\nconstitutional problem. See id., at 12035–12037, 12112–\n12132, 12315–12323, 12372–12377, 12488–12508, 12529–\n12534, 12612–12618, 12673–12680, 12734–12751, 12915–\n12960, 13347–13354, 14439–14458, 14487–14506. The\nPresident signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a\nsigning statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the\nAct but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.\nSee President’s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002).

In practical terms no “for\ncause” provision can, in isolation, define the full measure\nof executive power. This is because a legislative decision\nto place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the\nSecretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the\nway in which the statute defines the scope of the power\nthe relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to\nwho controls the agency’s budget requests and funding,\nthe relationships between one agency or department and\nanother, as well as more purely political factors (including\nCongress’ ability to assert influence) are more likely to\naffect the President’s power to get something done. That\nis why President Truman complained that “ ‘the powers of\nthe President amount to’ ” bringing “ ‘people in and try[ing]\nto persuade them to do what they ought to do without\npersuasion.’ ” C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154\n(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written\nthat the President “is neither dominant nor powerless” in\nhis relationships with many Government entities,\n“whether denominated executive or independent.” Strauss,\nThe Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow\ners and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 573, 583\n(1984) (hereinafter Strauss). Those entities “are all sub\nject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their\nfunctioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential\ndirection in others.” Ibid.

Rev.\nEn Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.\norg/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf\n(noting that “Presidents do not test the limits of their\npower by removing commissioners . . . ”); Lessig & Sun\nstein 110–112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to\ndefine what constitutes “cause” because Presidents rarely\ntest removal provisions).\n   But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we\nshould still conclude that the “for cause” restriction before\nus will not restrict presidential power significantly. For\none thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi\ndent’s power, but the power of an already independent\nagency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when\nit identifies its central constitutional problem: According\nto the Court, the President “is powerless to intervene” if he\nhas determined that the Board members’ “conduct merit[s]\nremoval” because “[t]hat decision is vested instead in other\ntenured officers—the Commissioners—none of whom is\nsubject to the President’s direct control.” Ante, at 14–15.\nBut so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from\nremoving the Commissioners except for cause (as the\nmajority assumes), nullifying the Commission’s power to\nremove Board members only for cause will not resolve the\nproblem the Court has identified: The President will still\nbe “powerless to intervene” by removing the Board mem\nbers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.\n   In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of\n“for cause” protection—Layer One insulating the Commis\nsioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the\nBoard from the Commissioners—impose any more serious\nlimitation upon the President’s powers than one layer.\nConsider the four scenarios that might arise:\n    1. The President and the Commission both want to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n        keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is\n        relevant.\n    2. The President and the Commission both want to\n        dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them\n        both from doing so without cause. The President’s\n        ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is\n        irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in\n        agreement.\n    3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,\n        but the Commission wants to keep the member.\n        Layer One allows the Commission to make that de\n        termination notwithstanding the President’s con\n        trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the\n        Commission does not seek to remove the Board\n        member.\n    4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but\n        the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem\n        ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it\n        hinders the Commission’s ability to dismiss a Board\n        member whom the President wants to keep in\n        place.\n  Thus, the majority’s decision to eliminate only Layer\nTwo accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a\nremoval restriction’s effect upon presidential power de\npends not on the presence of a “double-layer” of for-cause\nremoval, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real\nworld nature of the President’s relationship with the\nCommission. If the President confronts a Commission\nthat seeks to resist his policy preferences—a distinct pos\nsibility when, as here, a Commission’s membership must\nreflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. §78d(a)—the\nrestriction on the Commission’s ability to remove a Board\nmember is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may\nactually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the\nPresident faces a Commission that seeks to implement his\npolicy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi\n14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndent and Commission see eye to eye.\n  In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates\ntwo alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission\nand the President both want to remove a Board member,\nbut have varying judgments as to whether they have good\n“cause” to do so—i.e., the President and the Commission\nboth conclude that a Board member should be removed,\nbut disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they\nhave both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14–15. In the\nsecond, the President wants to remove a Board member\nand the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its\nfreedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the\nPresident (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while\napparently telling the President that it agrees with him\nand would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer\nTwo as an “excuse” to pursue its actual aims—an excuse\nwhich, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.\n  Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not\nknow if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their\nlogical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And\nthe fact that, with respect to the President’s power, the\ndouble layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,\nsometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over\nall effect is at most indeterminate.\n  But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and\nview the removal provision at issue in the context of the\nentire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily\napparent. That is because the statute provides the Com\nmission with full authority and virtually comprehensive\ncontrol over all of the Board’s functions. Those who cre\nated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc\nture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod\nies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as\nthe New York Stock Exchange and other similar self\nregulating organizations. See generally Brief for Former\nChairmen of the SEC as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations—\nwhich rely on private financing and on officers drawn from\nthe private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory\nauthority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed\n“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC\n2005).\n   Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac\ncounting Board the power to adopt rules and standards\n“relating to the preparation of audit reports”; to adjudicate\ndisciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that\nfail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en\ngage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec\ntions of accounting firms registered as the law requires\nand investigations to monitor compliance with the rules\nand related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. §§7211–\n7216. But, at the same time,\n    •\t No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and\n        until the Commission approves it, §7217(b)(2);\n    •\t The Commission may “abrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to”\n        any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the\n        Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission’s\n        view, doing so “further[s] the purposes” of the securi\n        ties and accounting-oversight laws, §7217(b)(5);\n    •\t The Commission may review any sanction the\n        Board imposes and “enhance, modify, cancel, re\n        duce, or require the remission of” that sanction if it\n        find’s the Board’s action not “appropriate,”\n        §§7215(e), 7217(c)(3);\n    •\t The Commission may promulgate rules restricting\n        or directing the Accounting Board’s conduct of all\n        inspections    and     investigations,   §§7211(c)(3),\n        7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);\n    •\t The Commission may itself initiate any investigation\n        or promulgate any rule within the Accounting\n        Board’s purview, §7202, and may also remove any\n16      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the\nCommission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and\nlegal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com\nmission has general supervisory powers over the Account\ning Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),\n(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”\nthat it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”\n§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author\nity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to\ninspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap\npropriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it\ncan censure the Board or its members, as well as remove\nthe members from office, if the members, for example, fail\nto enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or\nabuse the authority granted to them under the Act,\n§7217(d)(3). Cf. Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U. S. 311,\n314–319 (1903) (holding that removal authority is not\nalways “restricted to a removal for th[e] causes” set forth\nby statute); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 729 (rejecting the “ar\nguable premis[e]” “that the enumeration of certain speci\nfied causes of removal excludes the possibility of removal\nfor other causes”). Contra, ante, at 22, n. 7.

The Commission’s inability to remove a\nBoard member whose perfectly reasonable actions cause\nthe Commission to overrule him with great frequency?\nWhat is the practical likelihood of that occurring, or, if it\ndoes, of the President’s serious concern about such a mat\nter? Everyone concedes that the President’s control over\nthe Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum\nphrey’s Executor, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener, 357 U. S. 349;\nante, at 1–2. And if the President’s control over the Com\nmission is sufficient, and the Commission’s control over\nthe Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,\nthe President’s control over the Board should prove suffi\ncient as well.\n                               B\n   At the same time, Congress and the President had good\nreason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision.\nFirst and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15\nU. S. C. §7215. This Court has long recognized the appro\npriateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the\npersonal independence of those who even only sometimes\nengage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,\nsupra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;\nMorrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.\nUnited States, 141 U. S. 174, 191–201 (1891) (Field, J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison\nstated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu\ntive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States\n“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive\nbranch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly\nof the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;\ncf. ante, at 19, n. 6 (noting that the statute Congress ulti\n18      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nmately enacted limited Presidential control over the\nComptroller in a different fashion); see supra, at 4. The\nCourt, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory\nfunctions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at\n17–18. And when it finally does address that central\nfunction (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board\ndoes not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,\nn. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent\nwith the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing\n“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis\ntered public accounting firm, or an associated person\nthereof, should be disciplined”).\n   Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the\nAccounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,\ntechnical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring\nthat Board members “have a demonstrated” technical\n“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of\naccountants with respect to the preparation and issuance\nof audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the\n“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing\nreports require the application of “scientific accounting\nprinciples.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440\n(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional\nlegitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ\nence upon the need for technical expertise. See Hum\nphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624–626; see also Breger &\nEdles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation\nof Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111,\n1131–1133 (2000) (explaining how the need for adminis\ntrators with “technical competence,” “apolitical expertise,”\nand skill in “scientific management” led to original crea\ntion of independent agencies) (hereinafter Breger & Ed\nles); J. Landis, The Administrative Process 23 (1938)\n(similar); Woodrow Wilson, Democracy and Efficiency, 87\nAtlantic Monthly 289, 299 (1901) (describing need for\ninsulation of experts from political influences).\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             19\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Here, the justification for insulating the “technical\nexperts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to\npolitical influence is particularly strong. Congress delib\nerately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,\n148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for\ngood reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting\nBoard was created in response to “a series of celebrated\naccounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19\n(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And\nhistorically, this regulatory subject matter—financial\nregulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need\nfor independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)\n(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal\nTrade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra\ntive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold\nthe power of life and death over the great business inter\nests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .\ntaking these business matters out of politics”). And Con\ngress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres\nsional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148\nCong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).\n   In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably\nhave thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board\nmembers from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.\nCivil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565\n(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government\nand its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,\nbut it is also critical that they appear to the public to be\navoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative\nGovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).\nAnd in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern\nment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear\npower production, the Court’s assertion that we should\nsimply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex\n20      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nperts” is, at best, unrealistic—at worst, dangerously so.\nAnte, at 18.\n                               C\n   Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict\npresidential power and so likely to further a legitimate\ninstitutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti\ntutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon\nv. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),\nthe Court made clear that when “determining whether the\nAct disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate\nbranches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to\nwhich it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish\ning its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.\nThe Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a\nrestriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at\n691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric\ntions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s\nability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func\ntions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that\nlight”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat\ndiminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,\nbut it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to\nthe President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to\ncoordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.\nIndeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric\ntion that significantly interfered with the President’s\nimportant historic power to control criminal prosecutions,\na “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the\nconstitutionality of the present restriction would seem to\nfollow a fortiori.\n   Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re\npeatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict\nthe President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica\ntory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295\nU. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at\n17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also\nupheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with\ntechnical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special\nindependence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.\nThe Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of\nresponsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s\nadjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its\njob, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor\ntance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job\nto the public strongly justify a statute that assures that\nBoard members need not fear for their jobs when compe\ntently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the\nCommission as the ultimate authority over Board policies\nand actions. See Part II–B, supra.\n  Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way\nthat logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.\nIn Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed\nin Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,\nn. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the\nauthority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet\nengineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe\nrior officer.” The Court said,\n       “We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,\n    vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads\n    of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of\n    removal as it deems best for the public interest. The\n    constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the\n    appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and\n    regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may\n    enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per\n    kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota\n    tion marks omitted).\nSee also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi\n22      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ncer” who is appointed by a department head can be re\nstricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis\nsioners are “Heads of Departments”).\n   In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress\nmay constitutionally limit the President’s authority to\nremove certain principal officers, including heads of de\npartments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has\nconsistently recognized the validity of that holding. See\nWiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706\n(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,\nat 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,\nsupra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.\n361, 410–411 (1989).\n   And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated\nin a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the\nConstitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a\nfruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court\nshould not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence\nfor the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law\nshould treat their heads as it treats other Executive\nBranch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court\nheld in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and\nrestrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom\nthey appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).\n   Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of\npowers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of\none branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of\nanother branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);\naccord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor\nrison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has\nadded that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is\nthe only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”\nremoval restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu\ntion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the\npower to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMyers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has\n“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.\nIt has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam\nple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue\nstream independent of the congressional appropriations\nprocess. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC\nChairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the\nambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.\n   In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional\ncriteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond\nthe Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus\none is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates\na holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is\nconstitutional.\n                              D\n   We should ask one further question. Even if the “for\ncause” provision before us does not itself significantly\ninterfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize\nCongress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a\nbright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a\nseries of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,\nCongress might undercut the President’s central constitu\ntional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this\nquestion is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,\ninsofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.\nAnd in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious\nthan any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might\nbring about.\n   The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—\nan uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and\ngenerates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule\nmay not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi\ncative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac\ncounting Board performs adjudicative functions.          See\n24      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsupra, at 17–18. What, then, are we to make of the\nCourt’s potential exception? And would such an exception\napply to an administrative law judge who also has impor\ntant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,\ne.g., 8 CFR §1003.9, 34 CFR §81.4 (2009). The Court\nelsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal\nstatutes that provide for “judicial review of a[n] effort to\nremove” an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But\nwe have previously stated that all officers protected by a\nfor-cause removal provision and later subject to termina\ntion are entitled to “notice and [a] hearing” in the “courts,”\nas without such review “the appointing power” otherwise\n“could remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it\ndeemed sufficient.” Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.\n419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum\nphrey’s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging\nremoval). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,\nthen, should be given to this hint of an exception?\n   The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may\nnot apply to inferior officers who have a different relation\nship to their appointing agents than the relationship\nbetween the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,\n24–26. But the only characteristic of the “relationship”\nbetween the Commission and the Board that the Court\napparently deems relevant is that the relationship in\ncludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at\n23 (“Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to\nthe power to remove Board members”). Why then would\nany different relationship that also includes two layers of\nfor-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.\nPart II–A, supra (describing the Commission’s near abso\nlute control over the Board). In a word, what differences\nare relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding\nin fact applies only where Congress has “enacted an un\nusually high standard” of for-cause removal—and does not\notherwise render two layers of “ ‘ordinary’ ” for-cause re\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Compare Parts III–A, III–B,\nIII–C, ante, with Parts II–A, II–B, II–C, supra. And such\na mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying\nthat, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at\nleast at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding\nby its very nature is not “a restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor” one “day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321\nU. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).\n   The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher\nent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its\nrule may not apply to “the civil service.” Ante, at 26. The\n“civil service” is defined by statute to include “all appoint\nive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,”\nexcluding the military, but including all civil “officer[s]” up\nto and including those who are subject to Senate confirma\ntion. 5 U. S. C. §§2101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil\nservice thus includes many officers indistinguishable from\nthe members of both the Commission and the Accounting\nBoard. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the\n“competitive service”—the class within the broader civil\nservice that enjoys the most robust career protection—\n“includes a vast majority of all the civil officers” in the\nUnited States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5\nU. S. C. §2102(c).\n   But even if I assume that the majority categorically\nexcludes the competitive service from the scope of its new\nrule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu\nsion would be insufficient. This is because the Court’s\n26      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are\n“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts\nand scholars have struggled for more than a century to\ndefine the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without\nmuch success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con\nstitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does\nnot seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and\nwho are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of\nthe constitution”); Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651,\n661 (1997) (“Our cases have not set forth an exclusive\ncriterion for [defining] inferior officers”); Memorandum\nfrom Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, to the General Counsels\nof the Executive Branch: Officers of the United States\nWithin the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, p. 3\n(Apr. 16, 2007) (hereinafter OLC Memo), online at\nhttp://www.justice.gov/olc/2007/appointmentsclausev10.pdf\n(“[T]he Supreme Court has not articulated the precise\nscope and application of the [Inferior Officer] Clause’s\nrequirements”); Konecke, The Appointments Clause and\nMilitary Judges: Inferior Appointment to a Principal\nOffice, 5 Seton Hall Const. L. J. 489, 492 (1995) (same);\nBurkoff, Appointment and Removal Under the Federal\nConstitution: The Impact of Buckley v. Valeo, 22 Wayne\nL. Rev. 1335, 1347, 1364 (1976) (describing our early\nprecedent as “circular” and our later law as “not particu\nlarly useful”). The Court does not clarify the concept. But\nwithout defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the\nmajority’s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or\nthe coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates. I\nunderstand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case\napproach. But here that kind of approach (when applied\nwithout more specificity than I can find in the Court’s\nopinion) threatens serious harm.\n   The problem is not simply that the term “inferior officer”\nis indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Con\nsider the Court’s definitions: Inferior officers are, inter\nalia, (1) those charged with “the administration and en\nforcement of the public law,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 139;\nante, at 2; (2) those granted “significant authority,” 424\nU. S., at 126; ante, at 25; (3) those with “responsibility for\nconducting civil litigation in the courts of the United\nStates,” 424 U. S., at 140; and (4) those “who can be said to\nhold an office,” United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,\n510 (1879), that has been created either by “regulations”\nor by “statute,” United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303,\n307–308 (1888).\n   Consider the definitional conclusion that the Depart\nment of Justice more recently reached: An “inferior officer”\nis anyone who holds a “continuing” position and who is\n“invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign\npowers of the federal Government,” including, inter alia,\nthe power to “arrest criminals,” “seize persons or property,”\n“issue regulations,” “issue . . . authoritative legal opin\nions,” “conduc[t] civil litigation,” “collec[t] revenue,” repre\nsent “the United States to foreign nations,” “command”\nmilitary force, or enter into “contracts” on behalf “of the\nnation.” OLC Memo 1, 4, 12–13, 15–16 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; emphasis added).\n   And consider the fact that those whom this Court has\nheld to be “officers” include: (1) a district court clerk,\nHennen, 13 Pet., at 258; (2) “thousands of clerks in the\nDepartments of the Treasury, Interior and the othe[r]”\ndepartments, Germaine, supra, at 511, who are responsi\nble for “the records, books, and papers appertaining to the\noffice,” Hennen, supra, at 259; (3) a clerk to “the assistant\ntreasurer” stationed “at Boston,” United States v. Hart\nwell, 6 Wall. 385, 392 (1868); (4 & 5) an “assistant\nsurgeon” and a “cadet-engineer” appointed by the Secre\ntary of the Navy, United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760, 762\n(1878); Perkins, 116 U. S., at 484; (6) election monitors, Ex\n28      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

United States, 510 U. S., 163,\n170 (1994); (10) judges in Article I courts, Freytag, 501\nU. S., at 880–881; and (11) the general counsel of the\nDepartment of Transportation, Edmond v. United States,\n520 U. S. 651 (1997). Individual Members of the Court\nwould add to the list the Federal Communication Commis\nsion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s\n“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,\ngeneral counsels, and administrative law judges, see\nFreytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis\nsioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I\nstill see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps\nthousands of high level government officials within the\nscope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and\ntheir administrative actions and decisions constitutionally\nat risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would\nhave to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu\nreaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute\nremovable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,\nwhich I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be\nnecessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies\n(just below the top) who themselves are removable only\n“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi\ncials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They\ninclude most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (including that agency’s executive director as\nwell as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu\nlation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the\nleadership of the Social Security Administration, the\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. §§2101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high\nranking officials distinct from the “competitive service,” see\n§2101(a)(1)(C), who “serve in the key positions just below\nthe top Presidential appointees,” Office of Personnel Man\nagement, About the Senior Executive Service, online at\nhttp://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; §2102(a)(1)(C),\nand who are, without exception, subject to “removal” only for\ncause. §§7542–7543; see also §2302(a)(2) (substantially\nlimiting conditions under which “a career appointee in the\nSenior Executive Service” may be “transfer[red], or reas\nsign[ed]”). SES officials include, for example, the Director\nof the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug\nIntelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of In\nternational Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.\nSee Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Gov\nernment Affairs, United States Government Policy and\nSupporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter\nPlum Book). And by virtually any definition, essentially\nall SES officials qualify as “inferior officers,” for their\nduties, as defined by statute, require them to “direc[t] the\nwork of an organizational unit,” carry out high-level\nmanagerial functions, or “otherwise exercis[e] important\npolicy-making, policy-determining, or other executive func\ntions.” §3132(a)(2) (emphasis added). Cf. ante, at 2 (de\nscribing an “inferior officer” as someone who “determines\nthe policy and enforces the laws of the United States”);\nante, at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in\nindependent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in\nfuture cases). Is the SES exempt from today’s rule or is it\n30      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nnot? The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be\ndifferent, simply says that it will not “addres[s]” the mat\nter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot\ndo so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the\nSES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing\nthe inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.\n   The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects\nis yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis\ntrative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.”\nFreytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, e.g.,\nid., at 881 (majority opinion) (“[A] [tax-court] special trial\njudge is an ‘inferior Officer’ ”); Edmond, supra, at 654\n(“[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] offi\ncers”). But cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. And ALJs are each re\nmovable “only for good cause established and determined\nby the Merit Systems Protection Board,” 5 U. S. C.\n§§7521(a)–(b). But the members of the Merit Systems\nProtection Board are themselves protected from removal\nby the President absent good cause. §1202(d).\n   My research reflects that the Federal Government relies\non 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in\nover 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo\nrandum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage\nment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail\nable in Clerk of Court’s case file). These ALJs adjudicate\nSocial Security benefits, employment disputes, and other\nmatters highly important to individuals. Does every\nlosing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on\nthe basis that the decision entered against him is uncon\nstitutional? Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10 (“[O]ur holding also does\nnot address” this question).\n   And what about the military? Commissioned military\nofficers “are ‘inferior officers.’ ” Weiss, 510 U. S., at 182\n(Souter, J., concurring); id., at 169–170 (majority opinion).\nThere are over 210,000 active-duty commissioned officers\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncurrently serving in the armed forces. See Dept. of Defense,\nActive Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),\nonline at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/\nrg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that\nsuch officers may not be removed from office except for\ncause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–\n632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener\nally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see\n§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career\nprotections.\n  The majority might simply say that the military is\ndifferent. But it will have to explain how it is different. It\nis difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a\nPresident who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”\nArt. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”\nmilitary “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi\ncials. See Barron & Lederman, The Commander in Chief\nat the Lowest Ebb—A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.\nL. Rev. 941, 1102–1106 (2008) (describing President’s\n“superintendence prerogative” over the military). Cf. ante,\nat 26–27 (not “expressing any view whatever” as to\nwhether military officers’ authority is now unconstitutional).\n  The majority sees “no reason . . . to address whether”\nany of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed\nunconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to\nleave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But\nwhat is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all\nthese various officials to be put on hold while the courts of\nappeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?\nWill Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi\nsions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi\ndent then restore them via executive order? And, still,\nwhat about the military? A clearer line would help avoid\nthese practical difficulties.\n  The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the\nGovernment’s ability to function while these many ques\n32      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY \n\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court’s\nholding concerns only “the conditions under which th[e]se\nofficers might some day be removed.” Ante, at 27. But\nthis case was not brought by federal officials challenging\ntheir potential removal. It was brought by private indi\nviduals who were subject to regulation “ ‘here-and-now’ ”\nand who “object to the” very “existence” of the regulators\nthemselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those\nprivate individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person\nsimilarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially\nsubject to the Court’s amorphous new rule will be able to\nbring an “implied private right of action directly under the\nConstitution” “seeking . . . a declaratory judgment that”\nthe official’s actions are “unconstitutional and an injunc\ntion preventing the” official “from exercising [his] powers.”\nAnte, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.\nVelazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of\npreliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of\npowers violation); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S.\n579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Ante, at 7–10.\n   Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure\nsuch a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend\ning removal provision. For a court’s “ability to devise\n[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly”\nthe “background constitutional rules at issue” have been\n“articulated”; severance will be unavailable “in a murky\nconstitutional context,” which is precisely the context that\nthe Court’s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent\nhood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).\nMoreover, “the touchstone” of the severability analysis “is\nlegislative intent,” id., at 330, and Congress has repeat\nedly expressed its judgment “over the last century that it\nis in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that\nfederal service should depend upon meritorious perform\nance rather than political service,” Civil Service Comm’n,\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 367,\n380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional\nattention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).\nAnd so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the\nmany questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only\napply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will\nalso determine that the only available remedy to certain\ndouble for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.\n   Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the\ncontrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are\nworrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To\ninterpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few\ncircumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbi-\ntrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the\nrule more rational, but destructive.\n                                III\n  One last question: How can the Court simply assume\nwithout deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves\nare removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e\ndecide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Com-\nmissioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi-\ndent except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the\nCommissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for\ncause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the\nCourt’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I\nam not aware of any other instance in which the Court has\nsimilarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a\nconstitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that\ndefect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.\nAlabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (“We\ndo not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .\nespecially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would\n[thereby] arise”); The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refin-\ning Co., 322 U. S. 42, 46 (1944) (describing parties’ inabil-\n34      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY\n              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity to “stipulate away” what “the legislation declares”).\n   It is certainly not obvious that the SEC Commissioners\nenjoy “for cause” protection. Unlike the statutes establish-\ning the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the\nstatute that established the Commission says nothing\nabout removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its\ntext is concerned, the President’s authority to remove the\nCommissioners is no different from his authority to re-\nmove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See\nShurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (“To take away th[e] power of\nremoval . . . would require very clear and explicit lan-\nguage. It should not be held to be taken away by mere\ninference or implication”); see also Memorandum from\nDavid J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel\nto the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator\nfor Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.\n23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-\nproject.pdf (“[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide\ntenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .\nsettled principles, may remove . . . without cause”); The\nConstitutional Separation of Powers Between the Presi-\ndent and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)\n(same).\n   Nor is the absence of a “for cause” provision in the stat-\nute that created the Commission likely to have been inad-\nvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9-\nyear period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby\ncast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all “for cause”\nremoval provisions, but before it decided Humphrey’s\nExecutor, which removed any doubt in respect to the con-\nstitutionality of making commissioners of independent\nagencies removable only for cause. In other words, Con-\ngress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court’s\nprecedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make\nthe Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat 9-year period, Congress created at least three major\nfederal agencies without making any of their officers\nremovable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d\n(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47\nU. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46\nStat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-\nHumphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42\nU. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after\nHumphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to\nits pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in\nstatutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49\nStat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor\nRelations Board with an explicit removal limitation).\n   The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis\nsioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to\ncreate a dependent, rather than an independent agency.\nAgency independence is a function of several different\nfactors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those\nfactors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather\nthan presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its\nseparate litigating authority, its composition as a multi\nmember bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ\nent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political\nenvironment, reflecting tradition and function, that would\nimpose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried\nto remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.\nSee generally Breger & Edles 1135–1155.\n   The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to\nagency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research\nService official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde\npendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their\nstatutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing\ncongressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s\nrule into further confusion. For not only are we left with\nout a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left\n36      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

If any agency\ndeemed “independent” will be similarly treated, the scope\nof the majority’s holding is even broader still. See Appen\ndix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).\n   The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute\nbooks a “for cause removal” phrase that does not appear in\nthe relevant statute and which Congress probably did not\nintend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not\nto uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con\nstruction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but\nits opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“It is not the habit of the\nCourt to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless\nabsolutely necessary to a decision of the case” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of\nChicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979) (“[A]n Act of Congress\nought not to be construed to violate the Constitution if any\nother possible construction remains available”).\n   I do not need to decide whether the Commissioners are\nin fact removable only “for cause” because I would uphold\nthe Accounting Board’s removal provision as constitu\ntional regardless. But were that not so, a determination\nthat the silent SEC statute means no more than it says\nwould properly avoid the determination of unconstitution\nality that the Court now makes.\n                        *     *     *\n  In my view the Court’s decision is wrong—very wrong.\nAs Parts II–A, II–B, and II–C of this opinion make clear, if\nthe Court were to look to the proper functional and contex\ntual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board\nprovision constitutional. As Part II–D shows, insofar as\nthe Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails\nto do so. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In light of the present imprecision, it must either\nnarrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually\nalone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in\nplace a broader rule of decision applicable to many other\n“inferior officers” as well. In doing the latter, it will un\ndermine the President’s authority. And it will create an\nobstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func\ntioning of that workable Government that the Constitu\ntion seeks to create—in provisions this Court is sworn to\nuphold.\n   With respect I dissent.\n38      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The chart below first lists the\n24 departments and then lists the 24 additional offices,\nboards, and bureaus. I have highlighted those instances\nin which a “for-cause” office is situated within a “for\ncause” department—i.e., instances of “double for-cause”\nremoval that are essentially indistinguishable from this\ncase (with the notable exception that the Accounting\nBoard may not be statutorily subject to two layers of for\ncause removal, cf. Part III, supra). This list does not\ninclude instances of “double for-cause” removal that arise\nin Article I courts, although such instances might also be\naffected by the majority’s holding, cf. ante, at 26, n. 10.\nCompare 48 U.

Each of these officials is,\nunder any definition—including the Court’s—an inferior\nofficer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause\nremoval. See supra, at 25–30.\n   The data are organized into three columns: The first\ncolumn lists the “office” to which the corresponding official\nis assigned within the respective agency and, where avail\nable, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.\nsupra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger\nmaine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns\nrespectively list the career appointees in each agency who\noccupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen\neral” position is one that could be filled by either a career\nappointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current\n(career) occupant to be replaced.           See 5       U. S. C.\n§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be\nfilled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi\ntions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A\n“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a\ncareer appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general\nposition” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad\nrennial manual prepared by the congressional committees\nresponsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.\nPositions listed as vacant in that source are not included.\nThe data for the “reserved position” column come from a\nlist periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man\nagement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.\n16154–16251 (2007); §3132(b)(4).
