UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131394. Argued March 1, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nFounded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in\n  Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company\n  in America. Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was\n  Enron\u2019s chief executive officer from February until August 2001,\n  when he resigned. Less than four months later, Enron crashed into\n  bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value. After an investigation\n  uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron\u2019s stock prices by\n  overstating the company\u2019s financial well-being, the Government\n  prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the\n  scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of\n  command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.\n  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme\n  to deceive investors about Enron\u2019s true financial performance by ma\n  nipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false\n  and misleading statements. Count 1 of the indictment charged Skill\n  ing with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit \u201chonest-services\u201d wire\n  fraud, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its\n  shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services. Skilling\n  was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud,\n  wire fraud, making false representations to Enron\u2019s auditors, and in\n  sider trading.\n     In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contend\n  ing that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pre\n  trial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. He submitted hundreds\n  of news reports detailing Enron\u2019s downfall, as well as affidavits from\n  experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in\n  comparison to other potential venues. The District Court denied the\n  motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presump\n2                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\n    Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed,\n    media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional,\n    and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational. More\n    over, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.\n       In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for ques\n    tions it might use to screen prospective jurors. Rejecting the Gov\n    ernment\u2019s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling\u2019s more probing and\n    specific questions, the court converted Skilling\u2019s submission, with\n    slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document. The\n    questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news\n    and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron\n    and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and\n    their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\n    and to anyone affected by its demise. The court then mailed the\n    questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from\n    nearly all of them. It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 indi\n    viduals, and the parties, with the court\u2019s approval, further winnowed\n    the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical dis\n    ability. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospec\n    tive juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the de\n    fendants would prevent her from being impartial.\n       In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skill\n    ing\u2019s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty. Skilling re\n    newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror question\n    naires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey\u2019s\n    guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. The court again declined to\n    move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided\n    safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. The court also de\n    nied Skilling\u2019s request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that\n    potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with law\n    yers. But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask\n    follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined\n    individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants\n    jointly two extra peremptory challenges.\n       Voir dire began in January 2006. After questioning the venire as a\n    group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking\n    each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any\n    stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers\n    that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permit\n    ted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties\u2019\n    challenges for cause. Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective\n    jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to\n    empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates. After a 4-month trial, the jury\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud\n  conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.\n     On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here. First, he\n  contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented\n  him from obtaining a fair trial. Second, he alleged that the jury im\n  properly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire\n  fraud. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that\n  the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\u2019s\n  collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. Stating, however,\n  that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire,\n  found it \u201cproper and thorough,\u201d and held that the District Court had\n  empaneled an impartial jury. The Court of Appeals also rejected\n  Skilling\u2019s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to\n  commit honest-services fraud. It did not address Skilling\u2019s argument\n  that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his ac\n  tions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.\nHeld:\n    1. Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skill\n ing from obtaining a fair trial. He did not establish that a presump\n tion of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\n tried him. Pp. 11\u201334.\n       (a) The District Court did not err in denying Skilling\u2019s requests\n for a venue transfer. Pp. 11\u201319.\n         (1) Although the Sixth Amendment and Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 3, pro\n vide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was\n committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer\n of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice\n will prevent a fair trial. Pp. 11\u201312.\n         (2) The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice\n from which the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisi\n ana, 373 U. S. 723. Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kid\n naped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interro\n gated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his\n confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised\n three times to large local audiences shortly before trial. After the\n Louisiana trial court denied Rideau\u2019s change-of-venue motion, he was\n convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal. This\n Court reversed. \u201c[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and\n heard it,\u201d the Court explained, the interrogation \u201cin a very real sense\n was Rideau\u2019s trial\u2014at which he pleaded guilty.\u201d             Id., at 726.\n \u201c[W]ithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire,\u201d the Court held that\n the \u201ckangaroo court proceedings\u201d trailing the televised confession vio\n lated due process. Id., at 726\u2013727. The Court followed Rideau in two\n other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal\n4                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    prosecutions. However, it later explained that those decisions \u201ccan\n    not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . .\n    news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the de\n    fendant of due process.\u201d Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798\u2013799.\n    Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror\n    impartiality does not require ignorance. See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366\n    U. S. 717, 722. A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme\n    case. Pp. 12\u201316.\n           (3) Important differences separate Skilling\u2019s prosecution from\n    those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice. First, the\n    Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community\n    in which the crime occurred. In contrast to the small-town setting in\n    Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation\u2019s\n    fourth most populous city. Given the large, diverse pool of residents\n    eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals\n    could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain. Second, al\n    though news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no\n    blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau\u2019s dramatically\n    staged admission of guilt. Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in\n    which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years\n    elapsed between Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and Skilling\u2019s trial. Although\n    reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the\n    decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years\n    following Enron\u2019s collapse. Finally, and of prime significance, Skill\n    ing\u2019s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly,\n    earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelm\n    ing victory for the Government. It would be odd for an appellate\n    court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run\n    counter to that presumption. Pp. 16\u201318.\n           (4) The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily\n    on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed\n    at Enron. But \u201cpretrial publicity\u2014even pervasive, adverse public\n    ity\u2014does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d Nebraska Press\n    Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554. Here, news stories about Enron\n    did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court\n    has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Hous\n    ton\u2019s size and diversity diluted the media\u2019s impact. Nor did Enron\u2019s\n    sheer number of victims trigger a presumption. Although the wide\n    spread community impact necessitated careful identification and in\n    spection of prospective jurors\u2019 connections to Enron, the extensive\n    screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose\n    links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated. Finally, while\n    Causey\u2019s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial\n    created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropri\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nate steps to mitigate that risk. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     (b) No actual prejudice contaminated Skilling\u2019s jury. The Court\nrejects Skilling\u2019s assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect\nand defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.\nPp. 20\u201334.\n       (1) No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or\nbreadth of voir dire. Jury selection is \u201cparticularly within the prov\nince of the trial judge.\u201d Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594\u2013595.\nWhen pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, \u201cprimary reliance on\nthe judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense\u201d be\ncause the judge \u201csits in the locale where the publicity is said to have\nhad its effect\u201d and may base her evaluation on her \u201cown perception of\nthe depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.\u201d\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427. The Court considers the ade\nquacy of jury selection in Skilling\u2019s case attentive to the respect due\nto district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the\nmeasures necessary to ensure that impartiality. Pp. 20\u201321.\n       (2) Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of consti\ntutional requirements. The jury-selection process was insufficient,\nSkilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of\nthe District Court\u2019s questions were conclusory and failed adequately\nto probe jurors\u2019 true feelings, and the court consistently took prospec\ntive jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no mat\nter any other indications of bias. This Court\u2019s review of the record,\nhowever, yields a different appraisal. The District Court initially\nscreened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehen\nsive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey\nhelped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served\nas a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmi\nnation of a lengthy process. Moreover, inspection of the question\nnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstand\ning the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors\nlargely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the\ncorporation\u2019s collapse. Whatever community prejudice existed in\nHouston generally, Skilling\u2019s jurors were not under its sway. Relying\non Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727\u2013728, Skilling asserts the District\nCourt should not have accepted jurors\u2019 promises of fairness. But a\nnumber of factors show that the District Court had far less reason\nthan the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors\u2019 assurances of imparti\nality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the\nhorrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin\u2019s rampage of\nrobberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the ru\nral community in which Irvin\u2019s trial proceeded; circulation figures for\nHouston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n6                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    recorded in Irvin; and Skilling\u2019s seated jurors exhibited nothing like\n    the display of bias shown in Irvin. In any event, the District Court\n    did not simply take venire members at their word. It questioned\n    each juror individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face\n    opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with informa\n    tion from the questionnaires regarding jurors\u2019 backgrounds, opinions,\n    and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fit\n    ness for jury service. Pp. 22\u201330.\n            (3) Skilling\u2019s allegation that several jurors were openly biased\n    also fails. In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district\n    courts is at its pinnacle: \u201c \u2018A trial court\u2019s findings of juror impartiality\n    may be overturned only for manifest error.\u2019 \u201d Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at\n    428. Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the\n    seated jurors for cause, \u201cstrong evidence that he was convinced the\n    [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to\n    his guilt.\u201d Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557\u2013558. A review of\n    the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Ju\n    rors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she\n    would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove\n    its case. Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded\n    with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no\n    signs of prejudice this Court can discern. Pp. 31\u201334.\n       2. Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of \u201cthe\n    intangible right of honest services,\u201d is properly confined to cover only\n    bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling\u2019s alleged misconduct\n    entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Court\u2019s con\n    finement of \u00a71346\u2019s proscription. Pp. 34\u201351.\n          (a) To place Skilling\u2019s claim that \u00a71346 is unconstitutionally\n    vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent appli\n    cation of the honest-services doctrine. Pp. 34\u201338.\n            (1) In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts\n    of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statute\u2019s\n    prohibition of \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud\u201d to include depriva\n    tions not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.\n    See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110, which stimulated\n    the development of the \u201chonest-services\u201d doctrine. Unlike traditional\n    fraud, in which the victim\u2019s loss of money or property supplied the de\n    fendant\u2019s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest\n    services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.\n    While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no depriva\n    tion of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been\n    deceived, provided the enrichment. Even if the scheme occasioned a\n    money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, ac\n    tionable harm lay in the denial of that party\u2019s right to the offender\u2019s\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\u201chonest services.\u201d Most often these cases involved bribery of public\nofficials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the\ndoctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to\nhis employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all\nCourts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.\nPp. 34\u201337.\n        (2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi\nble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,\nwhich held that the mail-fraud statute was \u201climited in scope to the\nprotection of property rights.\u201d \u201cIf Congress desires to go further,\u201d the\nCourt stated, \u201cit must speak more clearly.\u201d Ibid. P. 37.\n        (3) Congress responded the next year by enacting \u00a71346, which\nprovides: \u201cFor the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that\nprohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, \u00a71341, and wire fraud, \u00a71343], the\nterm \u2018scheme or artifice to defraud\u2019 includes a scheme or artifice to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\u201d Pp 37\u201338.\n     (b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti\ntutionally vague. Pp. 38\u201351.\n        (1) To satisfy due process, \u201ca penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people\ncan understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that\ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc\ntrine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that \u00a71346\nmeets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,\nif possible, construe, not condemn, Congress\u2019 enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to\n\u00a71346\u2019s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how\nbest to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined\nto throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees\nthat \u00a71346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38\u201339.\n        (2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally\ncases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe in\ntangible right of honest services.\u201d There is no doubt that Congress\nintended \u00a71346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc\ntrine recognized in Courts of Appeals\u2019 decisions before McNally de\nrailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em\nphasis, enacted \u00a71346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision\u2019s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.\nPp. 39\u201340.\n        (3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended \u00a71346 to\ncover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its\ncore: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes\nto deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks\n8                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. In parsing the\n    various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skill\n    ing\u2019s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\n    were not models of clarity or consistency. It has long been the\n    Court\u2019s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as imper\n    missibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a\n    limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n    657. Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends\n    that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core be\n    cause the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.\n    This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers,\n    413 U. S., at 571\u2013572. Although some applications of the pre-\n    McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the\n    Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast\n    majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary\n    duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. Indeed, McNally\n    itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U. S., at\n    352\u2013353, 360. In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress\n    intended \u00a71346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Because read\n    ing the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would\n    raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that \u00a71346 criminalizes\n    only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.\n    Pp. 41\u201345.\n            (4) The Government urges the Court to go further by reading\n    \u00a71346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self\n    dealing by a public official or private employee. Neither of the Gov\n    ernment\u2019s arguments in support of this position withstands close in\n    spection. Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on non\n    disclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a\n    classic kickback scheme. See 483 U. S., at 352\u2013353, 360. Reading\n    \u00a71346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks\u2014and nothing more\u2014\n    satisfies Congress\u2019 undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n    Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the\n    pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of\n    the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\n    honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they\n    reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. Given the relative\n    infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies\n    they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting con\n    struction of \u00a71346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.\n    Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that \u201cambigu\n    ity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in\n    favor of lenity.\u201d Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25. The\n    Court therefore resists the Government\u2019s less constrained construc\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion of \u00a71346 absent Congress\u2019 clear instruction otherwise. \u201cIf Con\n  gress desires to go further,\u201d the Court reiterates, \u201cit must speak more\n  clearly than it has.\u201d McNally, 483 U. S., at 360. Pp. 45\u201347.\n          (5) Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\n  schemes, \u00a71346 is not unconstitutionally vague. A prohibition on\n  fraudulently depriving another of one\u2019s honest services by accepting\n  bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary\n  prosecution problem. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. As to fair no\n  tice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute\n  honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101,\n  and the statute\u2019s mens rea requirement further blunts any notice\n  concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101\u2013104. As\n  to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that\n  the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out\n  of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not\n  only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes\n  proscribing and defining similar crimes. Pp. 48\u201349.\n       (c) Skilling did not violate \u00a71346, as the Court interprets the\n  statute. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to de\n  fraud Enron\u2019s shareholders by misrepresenting the company\u2019s fiscal\n  health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he\n  solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for\n  making these misrepresentations. Because the indictment alleged\n  three objects of the conspiracy\u2014honest-services wire fraud, money\n  or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud\u2014Skilling\u2019s conviction is\n  flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298. This determina\n  tion, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy\n  conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless\n  error analysis. The Court leaves the parties\u2019 dispute about whether\n  the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the\n  question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of\n  Skilling\u2019s other convictions.

SKILLING, PETITIONER v. UNITED \n\n                    STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest\u00ad\nrevenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bank\u00ad\nruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising\nfrom the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron\nexecutive, for crimes committed before the corporation\u2019s\ncollapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community\nprejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?\nSecond, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of con\u00ad\nspiracy to commit \u201chonest-services\u201d wire fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7371, 1343, 1346?\n   Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed Skilling\u2019s convictions. We conclude, in common\nwith the Court of Appeals, that Skilling\u2019s fair-trial argu\u00ad\nment fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a\npresumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias\ninfected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the\nFifth Circuit\u2019s honest-services ruling.      In proscribing\nfraudulent deprivations of \u201cthe intangible right of honest\nservices,\u201d \u00a71346, Congress intended at least to reach\nschemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Con\u00ad\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstruing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that\ncore meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness\nshoal. We therefore hold that \u00a71346 covers only bribery\nand kickback schemes. Because Skilling\u2019s alleged miscon\u00ad\nduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within\n\u00a71346\u2019s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and\nvacate in part.\n                              I\n   Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its\nheadquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world\u2019s\nleading energy companies. Skilling launched his career\nthere in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company\u2019s founder,\nhired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily\nrose through the corporation\u2019s ranks, serving as president\nand chief operating officer, and then, beginning in Febru\u00ad\nary 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on\nAugust 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.\n   Less than four months after Skilling\u2019s departure, Enron\nspiraled into bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock, which had\ntraded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to\npennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend\nwhat caused the corporation\u2019s collapse, the U. S. Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising\nprosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The\nGovernment\u2019s investigation uncovered an elaborate con\u00ad\nspiracy to prop up Enron\u2019s short-run stock prices by over\u00ad\nstating the company\u2019s financial well-being. In the years\nfollowing Enron\u2019s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted\ndozens of Enron employees who participated in the\nscheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the\ncorporation\u2019s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand\njury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron\u2019s\nformer chief accounting officer.\n   These three defendants, the indictment alleged,\n    \u201cengaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the in\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

To support this assertion, Skill\u00ad\ning, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news\nreports detailing Enron\u2019s downfall; he also presented\naffidavits from the experts he engaged portraying commu\u00ad\nnity attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential\nvenues.\n   The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or\n\nwires in furtherance of \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain\u00ad\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.\u201d 18 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted\nEnron-related prosecutions,2 denied the venue-transfer\nmotion. Despite \u201cisolated incidents of intemperate com\u00ad\nmentary,\u201d the court observed, media coverage \u201cha[d]\n[mostly] been objective and unemotional,\u201d and the facts of\nthe case were \u201cneither heinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to\nBrief for United States 10a\u201311a.3 Moreover, \u201ccourts ha[d]\ncommonly\u201d favored \u201ceffective voir dire . . . to ferret out any\n[juror] bias.\u201d Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case,\nthe court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that\nSkilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\nId., at 22a.\n   In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court\nsolicited from the parties questions the court might use to\nscreen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a ques-\ntionnaire\u2019s format and content, Skilling and the Govern\u00ad\nment submitted dueling documents. On venire members\u2019\nsources of Enron-related news, for example, the Govern\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See United States v. Fastow, 292 F.

These rulings were made by two other\njudges of the same District. Three judges residing in the area thus\nindependently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could\nobtain a fair trial in Houston.\n   3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding En\u00ad\n\nron\u2019s collapse, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s opinion relies heavily on affidavits\nof media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support\nof his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 2, 3, 4, 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 5, n. 2, and\n23, n. 10; post, at 26, and 35, n. 22. These Skilling-employed experts\nselected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories.\nBut the District Court Judge did not find the experts\u2019 samples repre\u00ad\nsentative of the coverage at large; having \u201c[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed]\nall of the evidence\u201d Skilling presented, the court concluded that \u201cinci\u00ad\ndents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language\u201d were\ndwarfed by \u201cthe largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.\u201d App. to\nBrief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a.

The court granted hard\u00ad\nship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at\n11773\u201311774, and the parties, with the court\u2019s approval,\nfurther winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for\ncause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891,\n13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, \u201ceach\nand every\u201d prospective juror who said that a preexisting\nopinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her\nfrom impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at\n13668.\n   On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date\nscheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded\nguilty. Skilling\u2019s attorneys immediately requested a con\u00ad\ntinuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the pro\u00ad\nceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In\nthe interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,\narguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive\nbias and that news accounts of Causey\u2019s guilty plea fur\u00ad\nther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial\nvenue, Skilling urged that \u201cjurors need to be questioned\nindividually by both the Court and counsel\u201d concerning\ntheir opinions of Enron and \u201cpublicity issues.\u201d Id., at\n12074.\n   The District Court again declined to move the trial.\nSkilling, the court concluded, still had not \u201cestablish[ed]\nthat pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]\na presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d Id., at 14115.\nThe questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,\nprovided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence\npresented during the trial of . . .

I get more forthcoming responses from\n     potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I\n     don\u2019t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers\u2014\n     but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a\n     candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the\n     question.\u201d Id., at 11805.\nBut the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to\nask follow-up questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire\nmembers should be examined individually about pretrial\npublicity, id., at 11051\u201311053. The court also allotted the\ndefendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than\nthe standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi\u00ad\nnal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673\u201313675.\n   Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court\nfirst emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial\u00ad\nity and explained the presumption of innocence and the\nGovernment\u2019s burden of proof. The trial, the court next\ninstructed, was not a forum \u201cto seek vengeance against\nEnron\u2019s former officers,\u201d or to \u201cprovide remedies for\u201d its\nvictims.

In response to the court\u2019s query whether any pro\u00ad\nspective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these\ninstructions, two individuals indicated that they could not\nbe fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,\n819a\u2013820a.\n   After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District\nCourt brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward\n\nthe victims of Enron\u2019s collapse or a desire to see justice done would\noverpower prospective jurors\u2019 impartiality. App. 839a\u2013840a.\n8                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor individual examination. Although the questions var\u00ad\nied, the process generally tracked the following format:\nThe court asked about exposure to Enron-related news\nand the content of any stories that stood out in the pro\u00ad\nspective juror\u2019s mind. Next, the court homed in on ques\u00ad\ntionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible\nbias. The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up\nquestions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away,\nthe court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.\nIn all, the court granted one of the Government\u2019s for-\ncause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the\ndefendants\u2019 challenges and denied six. The parties agreed\nto excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for\nhardship.\n   By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 pro\u00ad\nspective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremp\u00ad\ntory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.6\nBefore the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the\nseating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in\nfact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 Selection\n              procedures of similar style and duration took place in\nthree Enron-related criminal cases earlier prosecuted in Houston\u2014\nUnited States v.

See Brief for\nUnited States 9 (In all three cases, the District Court \u201cdistributed a\njury questionnaire to a pool of several hundred potential jurors; dis\u00ad\nmissed individuals whose responses to the questionnaire demonstrated\nbias or other disqualifying characteristics; and, after further question\u00ad\ning by the court and counsel, selected a jury from the remaining venire\nin one day.\u201d); Government\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Response to\nDefendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Transfer Venue in United States v.

Supp. App. 3sa\u20134sa\n(Sealed).7 The court overruled this objection.\n  After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told\nthem they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow\nmedia accounts of the proceedings. \u201c[E]ach of you,\u201d the\ncourt explained, \u201cneeds to be absolutely sure that your\ndecisions concerning the facts will be based only on the\nevidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.\u201d App.\n1026a.\n  Following a 4-month trial and nearly five days of delib\u00ad\neration, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, includ\u00ad\ning the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not\nguilty of 9 insider-trading counts. The District Court\nsentenced Skilling to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019\nsupervised release, and $45 million in restitution.\n  On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his\nconvictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services\narguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the\nFifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and\nnegative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\u2019s\ncollapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554\nF. 3d 529, 559 (2009).8 The court also noted potential\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Skilling had requested an additional peremptory strike each time\n\nthe District Court rejected a for-cause objection. The court, which had\nalready granted two extra peremptories, see supra, at 7, denied each\nrequest.\n   8 The Fifth Circuit described the media coverage as follows:\n\n   \u201cLocal newspapers ran many personal interest stories in which\nsympathetic individuals expressed feelings of anger and betrayal\ntoward Enron. . . . Even the [Houston] Chronicle\u2019s sports page wrote of\nSkilling\u2019s guilt as a foregone conclusion. Similarly, the Chronicle\u2019s\n\u2018Pethouse Pet of the Week\u2019 section mentioned that a pet had \u2018enjoyed\nwatching those Enron jerks being led away in handcuffs.\u2019 These are\nbut a few examples of the Chronicle\u2019s coverage.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 559\n(footnote omitted).\n10               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice stemming from Causey\u2019s guilty plea and from\nthe large number of victims in Houston\u2014from the\n\u201c[t]housands of Enron employees . . .

Id., at 559\u2013\n560.\n   The Court of Appeals stated, however, that \u201cthe pre\u00ad\nsumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,\u201d and it therefore\nexamined the voir dire to determine whether \u201cthe District\nCourt empanelled an impartial jury.\u201d Id., at 561 (internal\nquotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).\nThe voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cproper and\nthorough.\u201d Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skill-\ning had challenged only one seated juror\u2014Juror 11\u2014for\ncause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments\nabout corporate greed, the District Court \u201cobserved [his]\ndemeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would\nmake the government prove its case.\u201d Id., at 564. In sum,\nthe Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome\nthe presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not\n\u201cshow[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced\nagainst him.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling\u2019s claim that\nhis conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit\nhonest-services fraud. \u201c[T]he jury was entitled to convict\nSkilling,\u201d the court stated, \u201con these elements\u201d: \u201c(1) a\nmaterial breach of a fiduciary duty . . . (2) that results in a\ndetriment to the employer,\u201d including one occasioned by\nan employee\u2019s decision to \u201cwithhold material information,\ni.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a\nreasonable employer to change its conduct.\u201d Id., at 547.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling\u2019s argument that\nthe honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude\nhis actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally\nvague.

We\ngranted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), and now affirm in\npart, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.9\nWe consider first Skilling\u2019s allegation of juror prejudice,\nand next, his honest-services argument.\n                              II\n  Pointing to \u201cthe community passion aroused by Enron\u2019s\ncollapse and the vitriolic media treatment\u201d aimed at him,\nSkilling argues that his trial \u201cnever should have proceeded\nin Houston.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 20. And even if it had\nbeen possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, \u201c[t]he\ntruncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out\nprejudices,\u201d he contends, so \u201c[f]ar from rebutting the pre\u00ad\nsumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively\nconfirmed it.\u201d Id., at 21. Skilling\u2019s fair-trial claim thus\nraises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court\nerr by failing to move the trial to a different venue based\non a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual preju\u00ad\ndice contaminate Skilling\u2019s jury?10\n                        A\n                        1\n  The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 We   also granted certiorari and heard arguments this Term in two\nother cases raising questions concerning the honest-services statute\u2019s\nscope. See Black v. United States, No. 08\u2013876; Weyhrauch v. United\nStates, No. 08\u20131196. Today we vacate and remand those decisions in\nlight of this opinion. Black, post, p. ___; Weyhrauch, post, p. ___.\n   10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of preju\u00ad\n\ndice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when,\nif ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Al\u00ad\nthough we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we\nconsider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the\nquestion we agreed to decide. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a).\n12                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe right to trial by an impartial jury.

See\nalso Amdt. 6 (right to trial by \u201cjury of the State and dis\u00ad\ntrict wherein the crime shall have been committed\u201d). The\nConstitution\u2019s place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not\nimpede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at\nthe defendant\u2019s request if extraordinary local prejudice\nwill prevent a fair trial\u2014a \u201cbasic requirement of due\nprocess,\u201d In re Murchison, 349 U.

See\nPlatt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U. S. 240, 245 (1964).\nFederal courts have invoked the Rule to move certain highly charged\ncases, for example, the prosecution arising from the bombing of the\nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. See\nUnited States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996).\nThey have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in\ncases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact,\nfor example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade\nCenter bombing, see United States v. Salameh, No. S5 93 Cr. 0180\n(KTD) (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); United States v. Yousef, No. S12 93\nCr. 180 (KTD) (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff\u2019d 327 F. 3d 56, 155 (CA2\n2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the\npress as the American Taliban, see United States v. Lindh, 212\nF. Supp. 2d 541, 549\u2013551 (ED Va. 2002). Skilling does not argue,\ndistinct from his due process challenge, that the District Court abused\nits discretion under Rule 21 by declining to move his trial. We there\u00ad\nfore review the District Court\u2019s venue-transfer decision only for compli\u00ad\nance with the Constitution.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

When\ndoes the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal\ndim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due proc\u00ad\ness requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence?\nBecause most cases of consequence garner at least some\npretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in\ndiverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing\nthe presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Skilling\u2019s case proceeded. The founda\u00ad\ntion precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723\n(1963).\n   Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana\ntown, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of\nthem. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel\npresent and obtained his confession. Without informing\nRideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the\ninterrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before\nthe trial, a local television station broadcast the film to\naudiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.\nRideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could\nnot receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime oc\u00ad\ncurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000\npeople. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury\neventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Lou\u00ad\nisiana upheld the conviction.\n   We reversed. \u201cWhat the people [in the community] saw\non their television sets,\u201d we observed, \u201cwas Rideau, in jail,\nflanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in\ndetail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and\nmurder.\u201d Id., at 725. \u201c[T]o the tens of thousands of people\nwho saw and heard it,\u201d we explained, the interrogation \u201cin\na very real sense was Rideau\u2019s trial\u2014at which he pleaded\nguilty.\u201d Id., at 726. We therefore \u201cd[id] not hesitate to\nhold, without pausing to examine a particularized tran\u00ad\n14                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscript of the voir dire,\u201d that \u201c[t]he kangaroo court proceed\u00ad\nings\u201d trailing the televised confession violated due process.\nId., at 726\u2013727.\n    We followed Rideau\u2019s lead in two later cases in which\nmedia coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.\nIn Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive\npublicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure\nduring preliminary court proceedings as reporters and\ntelevision crews overran the courtroom and \u201cbombard[ed]\n. . . the community with the sights and sounds of\u201d the\npretrial hearing. The media\u2019s overzealous reporting ef\u00ad\nforts, we observed, \u201cled to considerable disruption\u201d and\ndenied the \u201cjudicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol\nEstes] was entitled.\u201d Id., at 536.\n    Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nnews reporters extensively covered the story of Sam\nSheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant\nwife to death. \u201c[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during\nthe trial and newsmen took over practically the entire\ncourtroom,\u201d thrusting jurors \u201cinto the role of celebrities.\u201d\nId., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char\u00ad\nacterized as \u201cmonths [of] virulent publicity about\nSheppard and the murder,\u201d did not alone deny due proc\u00ad\ness, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard\u2019s case involved\nmore than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder\nconviction because a \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d pervaded the\ntrial, id., at 358.\n    In each of these cases, we overturned a \u201cconviction\nobtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted\nby press coverage\u201d; our decisions, however, \u201ccannot be\nmade to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to\n. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively\ndeprives the defendant of due process.\u201d Murphy v.

Mur\u00ad\nphy\u2019s trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings\nat issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723 (1963), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nwhich \u201centirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a\ndefendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of\nfairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.\u201d 421 U. S., at 799. Voir dire\nrevealed no great hostility toward Murphy; \u201c[s]ome of the jurors had a\nvague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each\nhad some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief\nin the relevance of [his] past to the present case.\u201d Id., at 800 (footnote\nomitted).\n  13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount\u2019s confession to a brutal\n\nmurder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed\ndue to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During\nvoir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an\nopinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates\nadmitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt. 467 U. S., at\n1029\u20131030.       Nevertheless, we rejected Yount\u2019s presumption-of\u00ad\nprejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we\nnoted, were at their height prior to Yount\u2019s first trial, four years before\nthe second prosecution; time had helped \u201csooth[e] and eras[e]\u201d commu\u00ad\nnity prejudice, id., at 1034.\n16                  SKILLING v.

A\npresumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends\nonly the extreme case.\n                             3\n   Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling as\u00ad\nserts that we need not pause to examine the screening\nquestionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury\u2019s\nverdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differ\u00ad\nences separate Skilling\u2019s prosecution from those in which\nwe have presumed juror prejudice.14\n   First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size\nand characteristics of the community in which the crime\noccurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the mur\u00ad\nder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.\nHouston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in\nthe Nation: At the time of Skilling\u2019s trial, more than 4.5\nmillion individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the\nHouston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of\npotential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial indi\u00ad\nviduals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 429 (1991) (potential\nfor prejudice mitigated by the size of the \u201cmetropolitan\nWashington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a popula\u00ad\ntion of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hun\u00ad\ndreds of murders are committed each year\u201d); Gentile v.\nState Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1044 (1991) (plurality\nopinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was\ndrawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Skilling\u2019s reliance on Estes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced;\n\nthose cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings\nduring trial. See supra, at 14. Skilling does not assert that news\ncoverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.\n  15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with\n\nhis first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named\nhim when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,\n72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s own con\u00ad\nfession [is] probably the most probative and damaging\nevidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill\u00ad\ning was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of\nthe smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa\u00ad\nbility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251\u2013\n252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (\u201cA jury may have difficulty in\ndisbelieving or forgetting a defendant\u2019s opinion of his own\nguilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of\nothers because they may not be well-founded.\u201d).\n  Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a\nwidely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over\nfour years elapsed between Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related\nnews throughout this period, the decibel level of media\nattention diminished somewhat in the years following\nEnron\u2019s collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467\nU. S., at 1032, 1034.\n  Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling\u2019s jury acquit\u00ad\nted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier\ninstituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no over\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nApp. 375a\u2013376a. In response to the follow-up question \u201c[w]hat words \n\ncome to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?\u201d, two-thirds of\n\nrespondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43%\n\neither had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind\n\nwhen they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling\u2019s name was\n\nassociated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210\u2013\n\n3211; see App. 417a\u2013492a. \n\n18                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhelming victory for the Government.16 In Rideau, Estes,\nand Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury\u2019s verdict did\nnot undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias. It\nwould be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice\nin a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run counter to that pre\u00ad\nsumption. See, e.g., United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867\nF. 2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (\u201cThe jury\u2019s ability to discern\na failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes\nindicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and\nreinforces our belief and conclusion that the media cover\u00ad\nage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an\nimpartial trial.\u201d).\n                               4\n   Skilling\u2019s trial, in short, shares little in common with\nthose in which we approved a presumption of juror preju\u00ad\ndice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion\nbased primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of\nmedia attention directed at Enron. But \u201cpretrial public\u00ad\nity\u2014even pervasive, adverse publicity\u2014does not inevita\u00ad\nbly lead to an unfair trial.\u201d Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stu\nart, 427 U. S. 539, 554 (1976). In this case, as just noted,\nnews stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid,\nunforgettable information we have recognized as particu\u00ad\nlarly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston\u2019s size and\ndiversity diluted the media\u2019s impact.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 As  the United States summarizes, \u201c[i]n Hirko, the jury deliberated\nfor several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly,\nwhich was routinely described as \u2018the first Enron criminal trial,\u2019 the\njury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron execu\u00ad\ntive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of\nslightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that\nthe true loss . . . was $40 million.\u201d Brief for United States 9\u201310 (cita\u00ad\ntion omitted).\n   17 The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention\n\naimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron\u2019s downfall more generally.\nData submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor did Enron\u2019s \u201csheer number of victims,\u201d 554 F. 3d, at\n560, trigger a presumption of prejudice. Although the\nwidespread community impact necessitated careful identi\u00ad\nfication and inspection of prospective jurors\u2019 connections to\nEnron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow\u00ad\nup voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight\nshows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra,\nat 24, jurors\u2019 links to Enron were either nonexistent or\nattenuated.\n   Finally, although Causey\u2019s \u201cwell-publicized decision to\nplead guilty\u201d shortly before trial created a danger of juror\nprejudice, 554 F. 3d, at 559, the District Court took appro\u00ad\npriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the\nproceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that\ndevelopment. And during voir dire, the court asked about\nprospective jurors\u2019 exposure to recent publicity, including\nnews regarding Causey. Only two venire members re\u00ad\ncalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and\nneither ultimately served on Skilling\u2019s jury. App. 888a,\n993a. Although publicity about a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea\ncalls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does\nnot ordinarily\u2014and, we are satisfied, it did not here\u2014\nwarrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.\n   Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 we conclude\nthat the District Court, in declining to order a venue\nchange, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntransfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories\nspecifically named him. App. 572a. \u201c[W]hen publicity is about the\nevent, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen\nany prejudicial impact.\u201d United States v. Hueftle, 687 F. 2d 1305, 1310\n(CA10 1982).\n  18 The parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can\n\nbe rebutted, and, if it can, what standard of proof governs that issue.\nCompare Brief for Petitioner 25\u201335 with Brief for United States 24\u201332,\n35\u201336. Because we hold that no presumption arose, we need not, and\ndo not, reach these questions.\n  19 The dissent acknowledges that \u201cthe prospect of seating an unbiased\n20                 SKILLING v.

Voir dire, Skilling asserts, did not ade\u00ad\nquately detect and defuse juror bias. \u201c[T]he record . . .\naffirmatively confirm[s]\u201d prejudice, he maintains, because\nseveral seated jurors \u201cprejudged his guilt.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 21. We disagree with Skilling\u2019s characterization of\nthe voir dire and the jurors selected through it.\n                              1\n   No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth\nor breadth of voir dire. See United States v. Wood, 299\nU. S. 123, 145\u2013146 (1936) (\u201cImpartiality is not a technical\nconception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of\nthis mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con\u00ad\nstitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is\nnot chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d). Jury\nselection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is \u201cparticularly\nwithin the province of the trial judge.\u201d Ristaino v. Ross,\n424 U.

Appellate courts making after-the-fact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\njury in Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the\nDistrict Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\u2019s motion to\nchange venue.\u201d Post, at 20. The dissent\u2019s conclusion that Skilling did\nnot receive a fair trial accordingly turns on its perception of the ade\u00ad\nquacy of the jury-selection process.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

See Reynolds, 98 U. S., at 156\u2013157. In contrast to\nthe cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in\u00ad\nthe-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more inti\u00ad\nmate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s\nfitness for jury service. We consider the adequacy of jury\nselection in Skilling\u2019s case, therefore, attentive to the\nrespect due to district-court determinations of juror im\u00ad\npartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that\nimpartiality.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 The  dissent recognizes \u201cthe \u2018wide discretion\u2019 owed to trial courts\nwhen it comes to jury-related issues,\u201d post, at 22 (quoting Mu\u2019Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427 (1991)), but its analysis of the District\nCourt\u2019s voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness. For\nexample, the dissent faults the District Court for not questioning\nprospective jurors regarding their \u201cknowledge of or feelings about\u201d\nCausey\u2019s guilty plea. Post, at 28. But the court could reasonably\ndecline to ask direct questions involving Causey\u2019s plea to avoid tipping\noff until-that-moment uninformed venire members that the plea had\noccurred. Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to\nfind a way to question venire members about Causey \u201cwithout mention\u00ad\ning anything\u201d). Nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about\nvenire members\u2019 knowledge of the plea; indeed, counsel posed such a\nquestion, id., at 993a; cf. post, at 28, n. 14 (acknowledging that counsel\n\u201csqueeze[d] in\u201d an inquiry whether a venire member had \u201cread about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). From this Court\u2019s lofty and \u201cpanoramic\u201d\nvantage point, post, at 22, lines of voir dire inquiry that \u201cmight be\nhelpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial\u201d are not hard to\nconceive.

Our review of the record, however,\nyields a different appraisal.21\n   As noted, supra, at 4\u20136, and n. 4, the District Court\ninitially screened venire members by eliciting their re\u00ad\nsponses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large\npart by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospec\u00ad\ntive jurors excusable for cause and served as a spring\u00ad\nboard for further questions put to remaining members of\nthe array. Voir dire thus was, in the court\u2019s words, the\n\u201cculmination of a lengthy process.\u201d App. 841a; see 554\nF. 3d, at 562, n. 51 (\u201cWe consider the . . . questionnaire in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to ask these questions must render the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d Id., at 425\u2013426. According appro\u00ad\npriate deference to the District Court, we cannot characterize jury\u00ad\nselection in this case as fundamentally unfair. Cf. supra, at 8, n. 6\n(same selection process was used in other Enron-related prosecutions).\n  21 In addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire, our decisions\n\nhave also \u201ctake[n] into account . . . other measures [that] were used to\nmitigate the adverse effects of publicity.\u201d Nebraska Press Assn. v.\nStuart, 427 U. S. 539, 565 (1976). We have noted, for example, the\nprophylactic effect of \u201cemphatic and clear instructions on the sworn\nduty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in\nopen court.\u201d Id., at 564. Here, the District Court\u2019s instructions were\nunequivocal; the jurors, the court emphasized, were duty bound \u201cto\nreach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the\nevidence [they] hear[d] and read in th[e] courtroom.\u201d App. 1026a.\nPeremptory challenges, too, \u201cprovid[e] protection against [prejudice],\u201d\nUnited States ex rel.

See\nsupra, at 8, n. 6.23\n   The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware\nof the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity,\nto ensure against jury bias. At Skilling\u2019s urging, the court\nexamined each prospective juror individually, thus pre\u00ad\nventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other\nvenire members. See Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 425. To en\u00ad\ncourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that\nthere were \u201cno right and wrong answers to th[e] ques\u00ad\ntions.\u201d E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling\u2019s re\u00ad\nquest for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience,\npotential jurors were \u201cmore forthcoming\u201d when the court,\nrather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805.\nThe parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask\nfollow-up questions of every prospective juror brought to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   22 The dissent\u2019s analysis undervalues the 77-item questionnaire, a\n\npart of the selection process difficult to portray as \u201ccursory,\u201d post, at 30,\nor \u201canemic,\u201d post, at 35. Notably, the \u201copen-ended questions about\n[prospective jurors\u2019] impressions of Enron or Skilling\u201d that the dissent\ncontends should have been asked, post, at 30, were asked\u2014on the\nquestionnaire, see supra, at 5\u20136, n. 4. Moreover, the District Court\ngave Skilling\u2019s counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about\ntheir responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g., App. 869a\u2013870a; id., at\n878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus follow-up opportunity to\ninterrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling\u2019s counsel \u201cclear ave\u00ad\nnue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.\u201d But see post, at 31, n. 17. See also\nApp. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (\u201cJudge, for the record, if I don\u2019t ask\nany questions, it\u2019s because the Court and other counsel have covered\nit.\u201d).\n   23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the \u201cBig Five\u201d public ac\u00ad\n\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen.

Skilling\u2019s counsel declined to ask\nanything of more than half of the venire members ques\u00ad\ntioned individually, including eight eventually selected for\nthe jury, because, he explained, \u201cthe Court and other\ncounsel have covered\u201d everything he wanted to know.\nApp. 967a.\n   Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the\nindividuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,\nnotwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection\nprocess successfully secured jurors who were largely un\u00ad\ntouched by Enron\u2019s collapse.24 Eleven of the seated jurors\nand alternates reported no connection at all to Enron,\nwhile all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial\nlink. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (\u201cI once met a\nguy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his\nname.\u201d).25 As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alter\u00ad\nnates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention\nto Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a\u2013860a (Juror\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury,\n\nthe dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that\njury. See, e.g., post, at 6, n. 4 (quoting the questionnaires of ten venire\nmembers; all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced, see\nRecord 11891); post, at 7, n. 6 (quoting the questionnaires of 15 venire\nmembers; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury); post, at 10\u201311, n. 7 (quoting voir\ndire testimony of six venire members; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury); post,\nat 28\u201334 (reporting at length voir dire testimony of Venire Members 17,\n29, 61, 74, 75, and 101; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury). Statements by\nnonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury\u00ad\nselection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one\nindicator that the process fulfilled its function.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, in turn,\nrepeatedly relies on Irvin, which she regards as closely\nanalogous to this case. See post, at 23 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent). See\nalso, e.g., post, at 15\u201316, 33, 35, 39\u201340. We disagree with\nthat characterization of Irvin.\n  The facts of Irvin are worlds apart from those presented\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(\u201c[R]emarkably in the eyes of many,\u201d \u201c[c]ases such as those involving\nthe Watergate defendants, the Abscam defendants, and . . . John\nDeLorean, all characterized by massive pretrial media reportage and\ncommentary, nevertheless proceeded to trial with juries which . . . were\nsatisfactorily disclosed to have been unaffected (indeed, in some in\u00ad\nstances blissfully unaware of or untouched) by that publicity.\u201d); Brief\nfor ABC, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 25\u201331 (describing other examples).\n   29 One juror did not check any box, explaining that she lived in an\u00ad\n\nother State when Enron went bankrupt and therefore \u201cwas not fully\naware of all the facts regarding Enron\u2019s fall [and] the media coverage.\u201d\nSupp. App. 62sa (Juror 20). Two other jurors, Juror 10 and Juror 63,\nindicated in answer to a different question that they had an opinion\nabout Skilling\u2019s guilt, but voir dire established they could be impartial.\nSee infra, at 32, and 33, n. 33.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhere. Leslie Irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and\nrobbery spree in a small rural community. 366 U. S., at\n719. In the months before Irvin\u2019s trial, \u201ca barrage\u201d of\npublicity was \u201cunleashed against him,\u201d including reports\nof his confessions to the slayings and robberies. Id., at\n725\u2013726. This Court\u2019s description of the media coverage\nin Irvin reveals why the dissent\u2019s \u201cbest case\u201d is not an apt\ncomparison:\n    \u201c[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin\u2019s] background,\n    including a reference to crimes committed when a ju\u00ad\n    venile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years pre\u00ad\n    viously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL\n    charges during the war. He was accused of being a\n    parole violator. The headlines announced his police\n    line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test,\n    had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the\n    six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess.\n    Finally, they announced [Irvin\u2019s] confession to the six\n    murders and the fact of his indictment for four of\n    them in Indiana. They reported [Irvin\u2019s] offer to plead\n    guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the de\u00ad\n    termination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to\n    secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had con\u00ad\n    fessed to 24 burglaries (the modus operandi of these\n    robberies was compared to that of the murders and\n    the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed\n    the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing\n    [Irvin\u2019s] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin]\n    as remorseless and without conscience but also as\n    having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of\n    doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described\n    as the \u2018confessed slayer of six,\u2019 a parole violator and\n    fraudulent-check artist.       [Irvin\u2019s] court-appointed\n    counsel was quoted as having received \u2018much criticism\n    over being Irvin\u2019s counsel\u2019 and it was pointed out, by\n28               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject\n     to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On\n     the day before the trial the newspapers carried the\n     story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of\n     [one victim] as well as \u2018the robbery-murder of [a sec\u00ad\n     ond individual]; the murder of [a third individual],\n     and the slaughter of three members of [a different\n     family].\u2019 \u201d Id., at 725\u2013726.\n\u201c[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were\ndelivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in\u201d the county\nwhere the trial occurred, which had a population of only\n30,000; \u201cradio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed\nthat county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the\nsame incidents.\u201d Id., at 725.\n  Reviewing Irvin\u2019s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that\n\u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice\u201d in the commu\u00ad\nnity \u201cwas clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir\ndire\u201d: \u201c370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those exam\u00ad\nined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,\u201d\nand \u201c[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.\u201d\nId., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although\nthese jurors declared they could be impartial, we held\nthat, \u201c[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much\nthat [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so\nhuge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one\nin which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing\nany testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.\u201d Id., at\n728.\n  In this case, as noted, supra, at 17, news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor\u00ad\nmation rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies\nand murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in\ncommon with the rural community in which Irvin\u2019s trial\nproceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media\nsources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   29\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrecorded in Irvin, see App. to Brief for United States 15a\n(\u201cThe Houston Chronicle . . . reaches less than one-third of\noccupied households in Houston.\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Skilling\u2019s seated jurors, moreover, exhib\u00ad\nited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin. See\nsupra, at 24\u201326 (noting, inter alia, that none of Skilling\u2019s\njurors answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they \u201cha[d] an opinion\nabout . . . Skilling\u201d). See also post, at 19 (dissent) (distin\u00ad\nguishing Mu\u2019Min from Irvin on similar bases: the \u201coffense\noccurred in [a large] metropolitan . . . area,\u201d media \u201ccover\u00ad\nage was not as pervasive as in Irvin and did not contain\nthe same sort of damaging information,\u201d and \u201cthe seated\njurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion\nabout the case\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In\nlight of these large differences, the District Court had far\nless reason than did the trial court in Irvin to discredit\njurors\u2019 promises of fairness.\n   The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire\nmembers who proclaimed their impartiality at their\nword.30 As noted, all of Skilling\u2019s jurors had already af\u00ad\nfirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no\ntrouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.\nNevertheless, the court followed up with each individually\nto uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to\ngauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information\nfrom the questionnaires regarding jurors\u2019 backgrounds,\nopinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy\nfoundation to assess fitness for jury service. See 554 F. 3d,\nat 562 (The District Court made \u201cthorough\u201d credibility\ndeterminations that \u201crequir[ed] more than just the [venire\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 The court viewed with skepticism, for example, Venire Member\n\n104\u2019s promises that she could \u201cabide by law,\u201d follow the court\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntions, and find Skilling not guilty if the Government did not prove its\ncase, App. 1004a; \u201cI have to gauge . . . demeanor, all the answers she\ngave me,\u201d the court stated, and \u201c[s]he persuaded me that she could not\nbe fair and impartial, so she\u2019s excused,\u201d id., at 1006a.\n30                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmembers\u2019] statements that [they] could be fair.\u201d). The\njury\u2019s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts\nafter nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests\nthe court\u2019s assessments were accurate. See United States\nv. Haldeman, 559 F. 2d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976). Skill\u00ad\ning, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell short\nof constitutional requirements.31\n                                3\n    Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and\ncontends they were openly biased. See United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 316 (2000) (\u201c[T]he seat\u00ad\ning of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause\n. . . require[s] reversal.\u201d). In reviewing claims of this type,\nthe deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: \u201cA\ntrial court\u2019s findings of juror impartiality may be over\u00ad\nturned only for manifest error.\u201d Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 428\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover,\nunsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for\ncause, \u201cstrong evidence that he was convinced the [other]\njurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as\nto his guilt.\u201d Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557\u2013558\n(1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to\nSkilling\u2019s specific allegations of juror partiality.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 Skillingemphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who\nsuffered from Enron\u2019s collapse because the District Court failed to grant\nhis for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund\nlost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron\nstock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on\nSkilling\u2019s jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory chal\u00ad\nlenge. \u201c[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge\u2019s erroneous for\u00ad\ncause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently\nconvicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,\u201d we have held, \u201che has\nnot been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.\u201d United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 307 (2000). Indeed, the \u201cuse [of] a\nperemptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error\u201d\nexemplifies \u201ca principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the\nconstitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Id., at 316.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling\u2019s counsel\ndeclined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors\nand, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because\nshe \u201cgave all the right answers.\u201d Id., at 972a. Whatever\nSkilling\u2019s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi\u00ad\nviduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis\u00ad\nplayed a disqualifying bias.33\n   In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption\nof prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\ntried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,\nneed not enter the box with empty heads in order to de\u00ad\ntermine the facts impartially. \u201cIt is sufficient if the ju\u00ad\nror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d\nIrvin, 366 U.

Taking account of the full record,\nrather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from\nit, we find no cause to upset the lower courts\u2019 judgment\nthat Skilling\u2019s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling that Skilling received a fair\ntrial.34\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 Although  Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at\ntrial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for\nPetitioner 14\u201315; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,\nthe voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that\nthey were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a\u2013853a (Juror 10) (did not\nprejudge Skilling\u2019s guilt, indicated he could follow the court\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair\nto Skilling, and said he would \u201cjudge on the facts\u201d); id., at 974a (Juror\n87) (had \u201cnot formed an opinion\u201d on whether Skilling was guilty and\naffirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).\n   34 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror\n34                  SKILLING v.

The honest-services statute, \u00a71346,\nSkilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna\u00ad\ntively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within\nthe statute\u2019s compass.\n                              A\n  To place Skilling\u2019s constitutional challenge in context,\nwe first review the origin and subsequent application of\nthe honest-services doctrine.\n                             1\n   Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the\npredecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,\nproscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to\nadvance \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud.\u201d See McNally\nv. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con\u00ad\ngress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,\n\u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money\nor property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.\u201d \u00a71341 (emphasis added); see\nid., at 357\u2013358. Emphasizing Congress\u2019 disjunctive phras\u00ad\ning, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted\nthe term \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d to include depri\u00ad\nvations not only of money or property, but also of intangi\u00ad\nble rights.\n   In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S. 415;\nPatton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.\n794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest\nconveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a\npremise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions\nwhen they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence\npresented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and\nthe District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nble-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110\n(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu\u00ad\ntion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from\nentrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial\nto the bribe payers. \u201cIt is not true that because the [city]\nwas to make and did make a saving by the operations\nthere could not have been an intent to defraud,\u201d the Court\nof Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. \u201cA scheme to get a\npublic contract on more favorable terms than would likely\nbe got otherwise by bribing a public official,\u201d the court\nobserved, \u201cwould not only be a plan to commit the crime of\nbribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.\u201d\nId., at 115.\n   The Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Shushan stimulated the\ndevelopment of an \u201chonest-services\u201d doctrine. Unlike\nfraud in which the victim\u2019s loss of money or property\nsupplied the defendant\u2019s gain, with one the mirror image\nof the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,\n101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor\u00ad\nruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender\nprofited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of\nmoney or property; instead, a third party, who had not\nbeen deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a\ncity mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third\nparty in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,\nyet the contract terms were the same as any that could\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length, the city (the be\u00ad\ntrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,\n483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,\nactionable harm lay in the denial of that party\u2019s right to\nthe offender\u2019s \u201chonest services.\u201d See, e.g., United States v.\nDixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).\n   \u201cMost often these cases . . . involved bribery of public\nofficials,\u201d United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167, 1171\n(CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector\n36                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhonest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application\nof the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing\na bribery scheme, explained:\n     \u201cWhen one tampers with [the employer-employee] re\u00ad\n     lationship for the purpose of causing the employee to\n     breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is de\u00ad\n     frauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual\n     deception that is practised is in the continued repre\u00ad\n     sentation of the employee to the employer that he is\n     honest and loyal to the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d United\n     States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp. 676, 678\n     (Mass. 1942).\n  Over time, \u201c[a]n increasing number of courts\u201d recognized\nthat \u201ca recreant employee\u201d\u2014public or private\u2014\u201cc[ould] be\nprosecuted under [the mail-fraud statute] if he breache[d]\nhis allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kick\u00ad\nbacks in the course of his employment,\u201d United States v.\nMcNeive, 536 F. 2d 1245, 1249 (CA8 1976); by 1982, all\nCourts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services the\u00ad\nory of fraud, Hurson, Limiting the Federal Mail Fraud\nStatute\u2014A Legislative Approach, 20 Am. Crim. L. Rev.\n423, 456 (1983).35\n                                    2\n  In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States,\nstopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine\nin its tracks. McNally involved a state officer who, in\nselecting Kentucky\u2019s insurance agent, arranged to procure\na share of the agent\u2019s commissions via kickbacks paid to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  35 In addition to upholding honest-services prosecutions, courts also\n\nincreasingly approved use of the mail-fraud statute to attack corruption\nthat deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights, including\nelection fraud and privacy violations. See, e.g., Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 18, n. 2 (2000); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.\n350, 362\u2013364, and nn. 1\u20134 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The following year, it\nenacted a new statute \u201cspecifically to cover one of the\n\u2018intangible rights\u2019 that lower courts had protected . . . prior\nto McNally: \u2018the intangible right of honest services.\u2019 \u201d\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19\u201320 (2000). In\nfull, the honest-services statute stated:\n    \u201cFor the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United\n    States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud,\n    \u00a71341, and wire fraud, \u00a71343], the term \u2018scheme or\n    artifice to defraud\u2019 includes a scheme or artifice to\n    deprive another of the intangible right of honest ser\u00ad\n    vices.\u201d \u00a71346.\n                             B\n  Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not\nclearly: He asserts that \u00a71346 is unconstitutionally vague.\nTo satisfy due process, \u201ca penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordi\u00ad\n38                 SKILLING v.

Lawson, 461\nU. S. 352, 357 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine\nembraces these requirements.\n  According to Skilling, \u00a71346 meets neither of the two\ndue process essentials. First, the phrase \u201cthe intangible\nright of honest services,\u201d he contends, does not adequately\ndefine what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38\u201339.\nSecond, he alleges, \u00a71346\u2019s \u201cstandardless sweep allows\npolicemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal\npredilections,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat[ing] opportunistic and\narbitrary prosecutions.\u201d Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461\nU. S., at 358).\n  In urging invalidation of \u00a71346, Skilling swims against\nour case law\u2019s current, which requires us, if we can, to\nconstrue, not condemn, Congress\u2019 enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571\n(1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products\nCorp., 372 U. S. 29, 32 (1963) (stressing, in response to a\nvagueness challenge, \u201c[t]he strong presumptive validity\nthat attaches to an Act of Congress\u201d). Alert to \u00a71346\u2019s\npotential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on\nhow best to interpret the statute.36 Uniformly, however,\nthey have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  36 Courts have disagreed about whether \u00a71346 prosecutions must be\n\nbased on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v.

First, we look to the doctrine developed in\npre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the mean\u00ad\ning of the phrase \u201cthe intangible right of honest services.\u201d\nSecond, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the\nstatute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to\nits core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved\nfraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services\nthrough bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who\nhad not been deceived. Confined to these paramount\napplications, \u00a71346 presents no vagueness problem.\n                               1\n  There is no doubt that Congress intended \u00a71346 to refer\nto and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized\nin Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions before McNally derailed the\nintangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner\n39; Brief for United States 37\u201338; post, at 2, 8 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress\nenacted \u00a71346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision\u2019s terminology. See 483 U. S.,\nat 355 (\u201cintangible righ[t]\u201d); id., at 362 (STEVENS, J., dis\u00ad\nsenting) (\u201cright to . . . honest services\u201d).38 As the Second\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  37 See, e.g., United States v.

McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 36\u2013\n37, 43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public offi\u00ad\ncial, in exchange for routing Kentucky\u2019s insurance busi\u00ad\nness through a middleman company, arranged for that\ncompany to share its commissions with entities in which\nthe official held an interest. 483 U. S., at 352\u2013353, 360.\nThis was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest;\nrather, the official conspired with a third party so that\nboth would profit from wealth generated by public con\u00ad\ntracts. See id., at 352\u2013353. Reading \u00a71346 to proscribe\nbribes and kickbacks\u2014and nothing more\u2014satisfies Con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlion\u2019s share of honest-services cases, limiting \u00a71346 to these heartland\napplications is surely \u201cfairly possible.\u201d Boos v.

(when adopting a limiting construction, \u201c[t]he\nlowest common denominator, as it were, must govern\u201d). So construed,\nthe statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 47\u201348; post, at\n8. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged\nthrough a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step\nwith precedent.\n46              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019 undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n   Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of\u00ad\ninterest cases constitute core applications of the honest\u00ad\nservices doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\nhonest-services convictions for \u201csome schemes of non\u00ad\ndisclosure and concealment of material information,\u201d\nMandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on\nwhich schemes qualified. In light of the relative infre\u00ad\nquency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to\nbribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit incon\u00ad\nsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable\nlimiting construction of \u00a71346 must exclude this amor\u00ad\nphous category of cases.\n   Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar\nprinciple that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal\nstatutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Cleveland,\n531 U. S., at 25 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.

E.g., United States v. Universal C. I. T.\nCredit Corp., 344 U.

Recall\nthat the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns\nabout (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory\nprosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. A prohibi\u00ad\ntion on fraudulently depriving another of one\u2019s honest\nservices by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present\na problem on either score.\n   As to fair notice, \u201cwhatever the school of thought con\u00ad\ncerning the scope and meaning of \u201d \u00a71346, it has always\nbeen \u201cas plain as a pikestaff that\u201d bribes and kickbacks\nconstitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951), and the statute\u2019s mens rea\nrequirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g.,\nScrews v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101\u2013104 (1945)\n(plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU.

The\nGovernment proposes a standard that prohibits the \u201ctaking of official\naction by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial\ninterests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he\nowes a fiduciary duty,\u201d so long as the employee acts with a specific\nintent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim\nto change its behavior. Id., at 43\u201344. See also id., at 40\u201341. That\nformulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct\nor significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To\nwhat extent does the official action have to further that interest in\norder to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and\nwhat information should it convey? These questions and others call for\nparticular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohi\u00ad\nbition in this context.\n48                  SKILLING v.

See United States v. Lanier, 520\nU. S. 259, 266 (1997) (\u201c[C]larity at the requisite level may\nbe supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain\nstatute.\u201d).\n   As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant\nrisk that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it\ntoday, will be stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on\nbribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-\nMcNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscrib\u00ad\ning\u2014and defining\u2014similar crimes. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7201(b), 666(a)(2); 41 U. S. C. \u00a752(2) (\u201cThe term \u2018kick\u00ad\nback\u2019 means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift,\ngratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind\nwhich is provided, directly or indirectly, to [enumerated\npersons] for the purpose of improperly obtaining or re\u00ad\nwarding favorable treatment in connection with [enumer\u00ad\nated circumstances].\u201d).45 See also, e.g., United States v.\nGanim, 510 F. 3d 134, 147\u2013149 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.)\n(reviewing honest-services conviction involving bribery in\nlight of elements of bribery under other federal statutes);\nUnited States v.

The principal federal bribery statute, \u00a7201, for example, generally\napplies only to federal public officials, so \u00a71346\u2019s application to state\nand local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct\nthat might otherwise go unpunished.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling\u2019s honest-services prosecution, the\nGovernment concedes, was not \u201cprototypical.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 49. The Government charged Skilling with\nconspiring to defraud Enron\u2019s shareholders by misrepre\u00ad\nsenting the company\u2019s fiscal health, thereby artificially\ninflating its stock price. It was the Government\u2019s theory\nat trial that Skilling \u201cprofited from the fraudulent scheme\n. . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and\nthrough the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron\nstock, which netted him $89 million.\u201d Id., at 51.\n    The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skill\u00ad\ning solicited or accepted side payments from a third party\nin exchange for making these misrepresentations. See\nRecord 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government\nto the District Court) (\u201c[T]he indictment does not allege,\nand the government\u2019s evidence did not show, that [Skill\u00ad\ning] engaged in bribery.\u201d). It is therefore clear that, as we\nread \u00a71346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.\n    Because the indictment alleged three objects of the con-\nspiracy\u2014honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property\nwire fraud, and securities fraud\u2014Skilling\u2019s conviction\nis flawed.

I therefore join Parts\nI and II of the Court\u2019s opinion. I also agree that the deci\u00ad\nsion upholding Skilling\u2019s conviction for so-called \u201chonest\u00ad\nservices fraud\u201d must be reversed, but for a different rea\u00ad\nson. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71346\n(2006 ed., Supp. II) that \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d in\nthe mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343\n(2006 ed.), includes \u201ca scheme or artifice to deprive an\u00ad\nother of the intangible right of honest services,\u201d is vague,\nand therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility\nin proclaiming that our task is \u201cnot to destroy the Act . . .\nbut to construe it,\u201d ante, at 42 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in transforming the prohibition of \u201chonest\u00ad\nservices fraud\u201d into a prohibition of \u201cbribery and kick\u00ad\nbacks\u201d it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the\npower to define new federal crimes. See United States v.\nHudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\n2                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it\nproscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague\ncannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan\nzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by\njudicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its\ntext does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.\n214, 219\u2013221 (1876). Our cases have described vague\nstatutes as failing \u201cto provide a person of ordinary intelli\u00ad\ngence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so\nstandardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri\u00ad\nously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d United States v. Wil\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues\nthat \u00a71346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages\narbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of\nthe right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.\nBrief for Petitioner 38\u201339, 42\u201344. In my view Skilling is\ncorrect.\n   The Court maintains that \u201cthe intangible right of honest\nservices \u201d means the right not to have one\u2019s fiduciaries\naccept \u201cbribes or kickbacks.\u201d Its first step in reaching\nthat conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to\n\u201cthe doctrine developed\u201d in cases decided by lower federal\ncourts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,\n483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I\nagree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the\nlower-court case law that had been disapproved by\nMcNally\u2014what the Court calls \u201cthe pre-McNally honest\u00ad\nservices doctrine,\u201d ante, at 42. The problem is that that\ndoctrine provides no \u201cascertainable standard of guilt,\u201d\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89\n(1921), and certainly is not limited to \u201cbribes or kick\u00ad\nbacks.\u201d\n   Investigation into the meaning of \u201cthe pre-McNally\nhonest-services doctrine\u201d might logically begin with\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nMcNally itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the\nmany Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the\nmeaning of \u201cfraud\u201d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat\u00ad\nutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483\nU. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi\u00ad\ntion of \u201cbribery and kickbacks,\u201d one would have expected\nthose words to appear in the opinion\u2019s description of the\ncases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally\neven provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing\ntheory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right\nof citizens \u201cto have the [State]\u2019s affairs conducted hon\u00ad\nestly,\u201d id., at 353, to \u201chonest and impartial government,\u201d\nid., at 355, to \u201cgood government,\u201d id., at 356, and \u201cto have\npublic officials perform their duties honestly,\u201d id., at 358.\nIt described prior case law as holding that \u201ca public official\nowes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office\nfor private gain is a fraud,\u201d id., at 355.\n   But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not\nlimited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held\nthat those fiduciaries subject to the \u201chonest services\u201d\nobligation included private individuals who merely par\u00ad\nticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.\nGray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295\u20131296 (CA6 1986) (citing\nUnited States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2\n1982)), and even private employees who had no role in\npublic decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720\nF. 2d 1327, 1335\u20131336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von\nBarta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, \u201cto say\nthat a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it\ngives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations\ndoes he owe as a fiduciary?\u201d SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318\nU. S. 80, 85\u201386 (1943). None of the \u201chonest services\u201d\ncases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those\npertaining to private employees, defined the nature and\ncontent of the fiduciary duty central to the \u201cfraud\u201d offense.\n   There was not even universal agreement concerning the\n4                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsource of the fiduciary obligation\u2014whether it must be\npositive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.\nRabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen\u00ad\neral principles, such as the \u201cobligations of loyalty and\nfidelity\u201d that inhere in the \u201cemployment relationship,\u201d\nLemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed\nhad grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)\ntrust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes\u00ad\ntooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec\u00ad\nond) of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7169\u2013185 (1976). Another pre-McNally\ncase referred to the general law of agency, United States v.\nBallard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on\nother grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes\nduties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re\u00ad\nstatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7377\u2013398 (1957).\n   This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes\nthat the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common\u00ad\nlaw fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde\u00ad\nfined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad\nlanguage. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5\n1967), loftily declared that \u201c[l]aw puts its imprimatur on\nthe accepted moral standards and condemns conduct\nwhich fails to match the \u2018reflection of moral uprightness,\nof fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the\ngeneral and business life of members of society.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109\n(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any\nscheme \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d was also condemned by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        Court is untroubled by these divisions because \u201cthese debates\nwere rare in bribe and kickback cases,\u201d in which \u201c[t]he existence of a\nfiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually\nbeyond dispute,\u201d ante, at 43, n. 41. This misses the point. The Courts\nof Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a\nbribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not\nconsistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a\nfiduciary.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe statute, United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167,\n1171 (CA9 1980). See also United States v. Mandel, 591\nF. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is \u201ccontrary\nto public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of\nmoral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and\nright dealing\u201d). Even opinions that did not indulge in such\ngrandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond\nloyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005\u2013\n1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be\ngreater for public officials than for private employees, see,\ne.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,\nn. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never\nmade clear.\n   The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many\ncourts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere\nbreach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest\u00ad\nservices fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col\u00ad\nlecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512\n(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute\nabout that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing\nduties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d\n234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that\ndid require something additional where a public official\nwas involved, there was disagreement as to what the\naddition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,\n522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate\u00ad\nrial misrepresentations and active concealment were\nenough, id., at 647\u2013648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,\nthe Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was\nneeded, id., at 1026.\n   Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private\nemployees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must\nuse his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare\nLemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron\nston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion\nupheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the\n6                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and\nconsulting fees from [his employer\u2019s] suppliers resulted in\na breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of\nhis loyal and honest services.\u201d United States v. Bryza, 522\nF. 2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however,\ndemanded more than an intentional failure to disclose:\n\u201cThere must be a failure to disclose something which in\nthe knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an\nindependent business risk to the employer.\u201d Lemire, 720\nF. 2d, at 1337. Other courts required that the victim\nsuffer some loss, see, e.g., Ballard, supra, at 541\u2013542\u2014a\nproposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981);\nUnited States v. O\u2019Malley, 535 F. 2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).\nThe Court\u2019s statement today that there was a deprivation\nof honest services even if \u201cthe scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party,\u201d ante, at 35, is\ntherefore true, except to the extent it is not.\n   In short, the first step in the Court\u2019s analysis\u2014holding\nthat \u201cthe intangible right of honest services\u201d refers to \u201cthe\nhonest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecisions before McNally,\u201d ante, at 39\u2014is a step out of the\nfrying pan into the fire. The pre-McNally cases provide no\nclear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of\nhonest services. The possibilities range from any action\nthat is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to\nonly the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his\nprincipal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator\u2019s position\nof trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The\nduty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but\nmaybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the\ncase of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time \u00a71346\nwas enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing\namong these options, for conclusively settling what was in\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

It knows that adopting\nby reference \u201cthe pre-McNally honest-services doctrine,\u201d\nante, at 42, is adopting by reference nothing more precise\nthan the referring term itself (\u201cthe intangible right of\nhonest services\u201d). Hence the deus ex machina: \u201c[W]e pare\nthat body of precedent down to its core,\u201d ante, at 39. Since\nthe honest-services doctrine \u201chad its genesis\u201d in bribery\nprosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for\nSkilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as \u201ccore\u201d\nor \u201cparadigm\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d examples, or \u201c[t]he most obvious\nform,\u201d of honest-services fraud, ante, at 43 (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel for\nthe Government say that they formed the \u201cvast majority,\u201d\nor \u201cmost\u201d or at least \u201c[t]he bulk\u201d of honest-services cases,\nante, at 42\u201344 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nTHEREFORE it must be the case that they are all\nCongress meant by its reference to the honest-services\ndoctrine.\n   Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it\nwould not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the stat\u00ad\nute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what\nacts constitute a breach of the \u201chonest services\u201d obligation\nunder the pre-McNally law. But it would not solve the\nmost fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the\n\u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d to which the bribery and kickback\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Courts since \u00a71346\u2019s enactment have fared no better, reproducing\n\nsome of the same disputes that predated McNally. See, e.g., Sorich v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3\u20134) (collecting cases). We have previ\u00ad\nously found important to our vagueness analysis \u201cthe conflicting results\nwhich have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges\nin seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.\u201d\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921). I am at\na loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.\n8                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                             Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nrestriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials?\nOr in addition to private individuals who contract with the\npublic? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer\nhere? The pre-McNally case law does not provide an\nanswer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limita\u00ad\ntion the statute does not answer the question \u201cWhat is the\ncriterion of guilt?\u201d\n   But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvi\u00ad\nous that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was\nnot the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and\nkickbacks represented \u201cthe core\u201d of the doctrine, or that\nmost cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,\nis not to say that they are the doctrine. All it proves is\nthat the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with\nregard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much\nmore. Among all the pre-McNally sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord-offerings\nof varieties of honest-services fraud, not one is limited to\nbribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has\ncooked up all on its own.\n   Thus, the Court\u2019s claim to \u201crespec[t] the legislature,\u201d\nante, at 44, n. 43 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely\nclear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to\nreinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law; and\nentirely clear that that prohibited much more (though\nprecisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kick\u00ad\nbacks. Perhaps it is true that \u201cCongress intended \u00a71346 to\nreach at least bribes and kickbacks,\u201d ante, at 44. That\nsimply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that \u201c\u00a71346\ncriminalizes only\u201d bribery and kickbacks, ibid.\n   Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation\nbut invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal stan\u00ad\ndard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (in\u00ad\ncluded within the vague one) that can pass constitutional\nmuster. I know of no precedent for such \u201cparing down,\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The   only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is Civil Ser\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

This is\nnot, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of\nadopting a \u201climiting construction\u201d in the face of potential\nunconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care\u00ad\nful to note, the narrowing construction must be \u201cfairly\npossible,\u201d Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), \u201crea\u00ad\nsonable,\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),\nor not \u201cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d Edward\nJ. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &\nConstr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we\nhave seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before\nMcNally concluded that the \u201cdeprivation of honest ser\u00ad\nvices\u201d meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If\nit were a \u201cfairly possible\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d construction, not\n\u201ccontrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d one would think that\nsome court would have adopted it. The Court does not\neven point to a post-McNally case that reads \u00a71346 to\ncover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the\nCourt so heavily relies, see ante, at 41\u201342, states that\n\u201cwhen the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvice Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in\u00ad\nvolved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of\nthe Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a\nvagueness challenge\u2014not, however, by \u201cparing down\u201d the adjudications\nto a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what\nthey held was not vague. See id., at 571\u2013574. The string of cases the\nCourt lists, see ante, at 41, n. 40, (almost none of which addressed\nclaims of vagueness), have nothing to do with \u201cparing down.\u201d The one\nthat comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.\n363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized\nby statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be\ncommenced and completed. That is not much different from \u201creading\nin\u201d a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con\u00ad\ntracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or \u201cparing down\u201d of\nthe statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that\nthe proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370\u2013371, and noted that\n(unlike here) it was not \u201cdecid[ing] issues of policy,\u201d id., at 372.\n10               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nstatute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations,\nby one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the\nother valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction\nwhich will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.\u201d\nUnited States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United\nStates v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45 (1953) (describing the\ncanon as decisive \u201cin the choice of fair alternatives\u201d). Here\nthere is no choice to be made between two \u201cfair alterna\u00ad\ntives.\u201d Until today, no one has thought (and there is no\nbasis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib\u00ad\nited only bribery and kickbacks.\n   I certainly agree with the Court that we must, \u201cif we\ncan,\u201d uphold, rather than \u201ccondemn,\u201d Congress\u2019s enact\u00ad\nments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the\npower, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.\nCongress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest\u00ad\nservices law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)\nunclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the\ntemptation to make all things right with the stroke of our\npen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).\nI would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s conviction on the basis that \u00a71346 provides no \u201cascer\u00ad\ntainable standard\u201d for the conduct it condemns, L. Cohen,\n255 U. S., at 89. Instead, the Court today adds to our\nfunctions the prescription of criminal law.\n                              III\n   A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted\nsupra, at 2, Skilling has argued that \u00a71346 cannot be\nconstitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi\u00ad\nnition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though\nthis reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling\u2019s\nchallenge a \u201cfacial\u201d one, in the sense that it seeks invalida\u00ad\ntion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to\npreventing its enforcement against him. I continue to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndoubt whether \u201cstriking down\u201d a statute is ever an appro\u00ad\npriate exercise of our Article III power. See Chicago v.\nMorales, 527 U. S. 41, 77 (1999) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIn the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skill\u00ad\ning identifies in \u00a71346 may mean that if he wins, anyone\nelse prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see\nSmith, supra, at 576\u2013578. But Skilling only asks that his\nconviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57\u201358, so the\nremedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.\n  I would therefore reverse Skilling\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a71346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it\nprohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions\u2014\nobvious from my reasoning in the case\u2014would be a matter\nfor stare decisis.\n                        *    *     *\n  It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the\ndescription of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be\ndone, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness\nopinions, United States v. Reese, 92 U. S., at 221:\n       \u201cThe question, then, to be determined, is, whether\n    we can introduce words of limitation into a penal\n    statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it\n    is general only.\n         \u201cIt would certainly be dangerous if the legislature\n    could set a net large enough to catch all possible of\u00ad\n    fenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and\n    say who could be rightfully detained, and who should\n    be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute\n    the judicial for the legislative department of the gov\u00ad\n    ernment. . . .\n         \u201cTo limit this statute in the manner now asked\n    for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old\n    one. This is no part of our duty.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

I write separately to address peti\ntioner\u2019s jury-trial argument.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants\na trial before \u201can impartial jury.\u201d In my view, this re\nquirement is satisfied so long as no biased juror is actually\nseated at trial. Of course, evidence of pretrial media\nattention and widespread community hostility may play a\nrole in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important\nin assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu\u2019Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 428\u2013432 (1991), or in reviewing\nthe denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for\ncause, see, e.g., Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036\u2013\n1040 (1984). There are occasions in which such evidence\nweighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end,\nhowever, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no\nviolation of the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury. See\nid., at 1031\u20131035, 1041; Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,\n800\u2013801, 803 (1975); see also Rivera v. Illinois, 556 U. S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2009) (slip op., at 7\u20138); United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe jury-trial right. Where there is extraordinary pretrial\npublicity and community hostility, he contends, a court\nmust presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of\nvenue. Brief for Petitioner 25\u201334. I disagree. Careful voir\ndire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even\nwhere pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile\ncommunity sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been\nselected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to\ninsulate jurors from media coverage during the course of\nthe trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is \u201can\nimpartial jury.\u201d If the jury that sits and returns a verdict\nis impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth\nAmendment requires.\n   The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text\nof the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It re\nquires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse\npretrial media coverage and community hostility in a\nparticular case has reached a certain level of severity, but\nthere is no clear way of demarcating that level or of de\ntermining whether it has been met.\n   Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960\u2019s\u2014\nSheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S.\n723 (1963). I do not read those cases as demanding peti\ntioner\u2019s suggested approach.          As the Court notes,\nSheppard and Estes primarily \u201cinvolved media interfer\nence with courtroom proceedings during trial.\u201d Ante, at\n16, n. 14; see also post, at 20 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Rideau involved unique\nevents in a small community.\n   I share some of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s concerns about\nthe adequacy of the voir dire in this case and the trial\njudge\u2019s findings that certain jurors could be impartial. See\npost, at 34\u201337. But those highly fact-specific issues are\nnot within the question presented. Pet. for Cert. i.

I respect\u00ad\nfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nJeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial\njury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the\npublic\u2019s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a\ncourt must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the\njury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The\nsudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of\npeople in the Houston area and shocked the entire com\u00ad\nmunity. The accompanying barrage of local media cover\u00ad\nage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As\nEnron\u2019s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the\nstorm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not\nconstitutionally compel a change of venue, they required\nthe District Court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which\nprospective jurors\u2019 attitudes about the case were closely\nscrutinized. The District Court\u2019s inquiry lacked the neces\u00ad\nsary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether\nthe jury empaneled to decide Skilling\u2019s case was capable of\nrendering an impartial decision based solely on the evi\u00ad\ndence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would\n2                SKILLING v.

The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.\nVirtually overnight, what had been the city\u2019s \u201clargest,\nmost visible, and most prosperous company,\u201d its \u201cforemost\nsocial and charitable force,\u201d and \u201ca source of civic pride\u201d\nwas reduced to a \u201cshattered shell.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b611, 13, pp.\n649a\u2013650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company\u2019s employ\u00ad\nees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van\u00ad\nish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,\nthousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses\nshuttered, and community groups that once benefited from\nEnron\u2019s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con\u00ad\ntributions. See, e.g., 3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also\n554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (\u201cAccounting firms that\nserviced Enron\u2019s books had less work, hotels had more\nopen rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on\u201d).\nEnron\u2019s community ties were so extensive that the entire\nlocal U.

A Chronicle report on\nSkilling\u2019s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the\ncoverage. It began, \u201cAcross Houston, Enron employees\nwatched former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling\u2019s congres\u00ad\nsional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry\nand then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy\nand detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance\nabout critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed\nenergy giant.\u201d App. 1218a. \u201c \u2018He is lying; he knew every\u00ad\nthing,\u2019 said [an employee], who said she had seen Skilling\nfrequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling\nwas known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at\nthe company. \u2018I am getting sicker by the minute.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n1219a.

UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nplea wreaks havoc for Lay, Skilling.\u201d Record 12049, n. 13;\nsee also ibid. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who de\u00ad\nscribed the plea as \u201ca serious blow to the defense\u201d). A\nChronicle editorial opined that \u201cCausey\u2019s admission of\nsecurities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay\u2019s claim that\nmost of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial\npressure rather than actual wrongdoing.\u201d Id., at 12391.\n   With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re\u00ad\nnewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the\nquestionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con\u00ad\nfirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In\nthe alternative, Skilling asserted that \u201cdefendants are\nentitled to a more thorough jury selection process than\ncurrently envisioned by the [c]ourt.\u201d Id., at 12067. The\ncourt had announced its intention to question individual\njurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre\u00ad\nsent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,\ne.g., id., at 11804\u201311805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter\nalia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in\nquestioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri\u00ad\nvately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would\nbe easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,\nclients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070\u201312072; and\nthat the court \u201cavoid leading questions,\u201d which \u201ctend to\n[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that\nmay not reflect their actual views,\u201d id., at 12072. At a\nminimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a\ncontinuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques\u00ad\ntionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at\n12074\u201312075.\n   The District Court denied Skilling\u2019s motion without a\nhearing, stating in a brief order that it was \u201cnot persuaded\nthat the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .\nestablish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju\u00ad\ndice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d Id.,\nat 14115. According to the court, the \u201cjury questionnaires\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the\ncourt\u2019s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide\nadequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the\nselection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.\u201d Id., at\n14115\u201314116. The court did agree to delay the trial by\ntwo weeks, until January 30, 2006.\n  The coming trial featured prominently in local news\noutlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle\ndescribed \u201cthe hurt and anger and resentment\u201d that had\nbeen \u201cchurn[ing] inside\u201d Houstonians since Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse. Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for\noffering a \u201cdoofus defense\u201d (\u201ca plea of not guilty by reason\nof empty-headedness\u201d), the paper stated that \u201cLay and\nSkilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet\nnow fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.\u201d\nIbid. The article allowed that the defendants\u2019 guilt,\n\u201cthough perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an\nassertion. A jury now takes up the task of deciding\nwhether that assertion is valid.\u201d Id., at 39947. The next\nparagraph, however, assured readers that \u201cit\u2019s normal for\nyour skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe\u00ad\neyed innocence that they were unaware that something\nwas amiss at Enron. The company\u2019s utter failure belies\nthe claim.\u201d Ibid. (one paragraph break omitted); see also\nid., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would \u201chave\nto offer a convincing explanation for how executives once\ntouted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark\nabout the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their\nown company\u201d).\n  It is against this backdrop of widespread community\nimpact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection\nin Skilling\u2019s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective\njurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse lo\u00ad\ncated \u201cabout six blocks from Enron\u2019s former headquar\u00ad\nters.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the\nDistrict Court began by briefly describing the case and\n10                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nproviding a standard admonition about the need to be fair\nand impartial and to decide the case based solely on the\ntrial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked\nwhether anyone had \u201cany reservations about your ability\nto conscientiously and fairly follow these very important\nrules.\u201d App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands\nand were called forward to the bench. One told the court\nthat he thought Lay and Skilling \u201cknew exactly what they\nwere doing\u201d and would have to prove their innocence. Id.,\nat 818a\u2013819a. The second juror, who had stated on his\nwritten questionnaire that he held no opinion that would\npreclude him from being impartial, declared that he\n\u201cwould dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to\nclaim responsibility, at least 1\u204412 of the responsibility, for\nputting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their\nlives.\u201d Id., at 819a\u2013820a. The court excused both jurors\nfor cause.\n   The court proceeded to question individual jurors from\nthe bench. As the majority recounts, ante, at 7\u20138, the\ncourt asked them a few general yes/no questions about\ntheir exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of,\n\u201cDo you recall any particular articles that stand out that\nyou\u2019ve read about the case?\u201d App. 850a. The court also\nasked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,\nfocusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly\npartial comments, the prospective jurors believed they\n\u201ccould be fair\u201d and \u201cput the government to its proof.\u201d Id.,\nat 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues\nraised by the court. The court made clear, however, that\nits patience would be limited, see, e.g., id., at 879a, and\nquestioning tended to be brief\u2014generally less than five\nminutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying\nbiases among several prospective jurors who had earlier\nexpressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 See   App. 894a (Juror 43) (expressed the view that the defendants\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Once it identified 38 qualified prospective jurors, the\ncourt allowed the defense and Government to exercise\ntheir allotted peremptory challenges. This left 12 jurors\nand 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for\nthe first time, \u201cnot [to] read anything dealing with the\ncase or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or\ntelevision or access any Internet sites that may deal with\nthe case\u201d and to \u201cinform your friends and family members\nthat they should not discuss with you anything they may\nhave read or heard about this case.\u201d Id., at 1026a. Start\nto finish, the selection process took about five hours.\n  Skilling\u2019s trial commenced the next day and lasted four\nmonths. After several days of deliberations, the jury\nfound Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities\nfraud, 5 counts of making false representations to audi\u00ad\ntors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 in\u00ad\nsider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all\ncounts.\n  On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his\nconstitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\nAddressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by\ndisavowing the District Court\u2019s findings concerning \u201ccom\u00ad\nmunity hostility.\u201d There was, the court concluded, \u201csuffi\u00ad\ncient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding\nof presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense\nvolume of coverage.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 559. \u201c[P]rejudice was\n[also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator\u2019s well\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cstole money\u201d from their employees); id., at 922a (Juror 55) (admitted\nthat she \u201clean[ed] towards prejudging\u201d the defendants); id., at 946a\n(Juror 71) (stated that she would place the burden of proof on the\ndefendants); id., at 954a\u2013960a (Juror 75) (indicated that she could not\nset aside her view that there was fraud at Enron); id., at 1003a\u20131006a\n(Juror 104) (stated that she questioned the defendants\u2019 innocence and\nthat she \u201cwould be very upset with the government if they could not\nprove their case\u201d); id., at 1008a (Juror 112) (expressed that the view\nthat the defendants were guilty).\n12              SKILLING v.

The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District\nCourt for failing to \u201cconsider the wider context.\u201d Id., at\n560. \u201c[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess\nthe tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the\nvolume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the\nreal inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele\u00ad\nvant sources.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]he district court\nseemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more\nthan just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer\nnumber of victims.\u201d Ibid.\n  Having determined that \u201cSkilling was entitled to a\npresumption of prejudice,\u201d the Court of Appeals proceeded\nto explain that \u201cthe presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the\ngovernment may demonstrate from the voir dire that an\nimpartial jury was actually impanelled.\u201d Id., at 561 (in\u00ad\nternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire\nas \u201cexemplary,\u201d \u201csearching,\u201d and \u201cproper and thorough,\u201d\nid., at 562, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he government\n[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that\nconvicted Skilling was impartial,\u201d id., at 564\u2013565. On this\nbasis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling\u2019s claim and\naffirmed his convictions.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and\nthe due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran\u00ad\ntee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside\npreconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and\ndecide guilt or innocence \u201cbased on the evidence presented\nin court.\u201d Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see\nalso Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.

Yount, 467 U. S.\n1025, 1031 (1984).\n   The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre\u00ad\nsumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:\nOnce the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com\u00ad\nmunity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to\nprove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly\nenvisions a fixed point at which public passions become so\nintense that prejudice to a defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights\nmust be presumed. The majority declines, however, to\ndecide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the\nCourt of Appeals held.\n   This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive\nprejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely\nconvey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of\npublic enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju\u00ad\ndices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The under\u00ad\nlying question has always been this: Do we have confi\u00ad\ndence that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cinduced only by evidence\nand argument in open court, and not by any outside influ\u00ad\nence, whether of private talk or public print\u201d? Patterson v.\nColorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,\n462 (1907).\n   The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a\njury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the\nintensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial\npublicity and community animus.           Reviewing courts,\nmeanwhile, must assess whether the trial court\u2019s proce\u00ad\ndures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury\nfree from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421\nU. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for \u201cany\nindications in the totality of circumstances that peti\u00ad\ntioner\u2019s trial was not fundamentally fair\u201d). This Court\u2019s\nprecedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different\n14              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsituations to safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional right\nto a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n   At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare\noccasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circum\u00ad\nstances that it has reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction\n\u201cwithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire examination\nof the members of the jury.\u201d Rideau v. Louisiana, 373\nU. S. 723, 727 (1963). In Rideau, repeated television\nbroadcasts of the defendant\u2019s confession to murder, rob\u00ad\nbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local senti\u00ad\nment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir\ndire could have secured an impartial jury. A change of\nvenue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to\nassure a fair trial. Ibid.; see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a723.2(a), p. 264\n(3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (\u201cThe best reading of\nRideau is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial\npublicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that\nthe voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the\nlikely prejudice among prospective jurors\u201d).\n   As the majority describes, ante, at 14, this Court\nreached similar conclusions in Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S.\n532 (1965), and Sheppard, 384 U. S. 333. These cases\ninvolved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media\ndisruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argu\u00ad\nment that the defendants were not entitled to relief from\ntheir convictions because they \u201cha[d] established no isola\u00ad\ntable prejudice,\u201d the Court described the \u201cuntoward cir\u00ad\ncumstances\u201d as \u201cinherently suspect.\u201d Estes, 381 U. S., at\n542, 544. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to\nhave been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the \u201cbed\u00ad\nlam\u201d that surrounded them. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355.\nCriticizing the trial courts\u2019 failures \u201cto protect the jury\nfrom outside influence,\u201d id., at 358, the Court stressed\nthat, \u201cwhere there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudi\u00ad\ncial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nshould continue the case until the threat abates, or trans\u00ad\nfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.\u201d\nId., at 363. Estes and Sheppard thus applied Rideau\u2019s\ninsight that in particularly extreme circumstances even\nthe most rigorous voir dire cannot suffice to dispel the\nreasonable likelihood of jury bias.\n   Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has\ndeclined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead\nexamined the particulars of the jury selection process to\ndetermine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted\nby pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court\nhas recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant\npervades the community there is a high risk that biased\njurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is\nnot merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately\nhide their prejudices, but also that, as \u201cpart of a commu\u00ad\nnity deeply hostile to the accused,\u201d \u201cthey may unwittingly\n[be] influenced\u201d by the fervor that surrounds them. Mur\nphy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in such\nadverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully con\u00ad\nsider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors\nand then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assur\u00ad\nances of fairness. Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719,\n729 (1992) (\u201c[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right\nto an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify\nunqualified jurors\u201d).\n   Irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial\ncourt\u2019s voir dire did not suffice to counter the \u201cwave of\npublic passion\u201d that had swept the community prior to the\ndefendant\u2019s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news media\nhad \u201cextensively covered\u201d the crimes (a murder spree),\n\u201carous[ing] great excitement and indignation.\u201d Id., at 719\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin\u2019s\narrest, the press \u201cblanketed\u201d the community with \u201ca bar\u00ad\nrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pic\u00ad\ntures\u201d communicating numerous unfavorable details about\n16               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nIrvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. Id., at\n725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors ex\u00ad\namined during the trial court\u2019s voir dire \u201centertained some\nopinion as to guilt\u2014ranging in intensity from mere suspi\u00ad\ncion to absolute certainty.\u201d Id., at 727. Of the 12 jurors\nseated, 8 \u201cthought petitioner was guilty,\u201d although \u201ceach\nindicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could ren\u00ad\nder an impartial verdict.\u201d Id., at 727, 724.\n    Despite the seated jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality,\nthis Court invalidated Irvin\u2019s conviction for want of due\nprocess. \u201cIt is not required,\u201d this Court declared, \u201cthat the\njurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\n. . . It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression\nor opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence\npresented in court.\u201d Id., at 722\u2013723. The Court empha\u00ad\nsized, however, that a juror\u2019s word on this matter is not\ndecisive, particularly when \u201cthe build-up of prejudice [in\nthe community] is clear and convincing.\u201d Id., at 725.\nMany of Irvin\u2019s jurors, the Court noted, had been influ\u00ad\nenced by \u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown\nto be present throughout the community.\u201d Id., at 727\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not\n\u201cdoubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he\nwould be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so\nmany, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a state\u00ad\nment of impartiality can be given little weight.\u201d Id., at\n728.\n    The media coverage and community animosity in Irvin\nwas particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this\nCourt recognized that high-profile cases may generate\nsubstantial publicity without stirring similar public pas\u00ad\nsions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court\nclarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case\nsuch as Irvin. So long as the trial court conducts a rea\u00ad\nsonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the abil\u00ad\nity of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     17\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\na verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would\ngenerally have no reason to doubt the jury\u2019s impartiality.8\n  The first of these cases, Murphy, 421 U. S. 794, involved\na well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi\u00ad\ncized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied\nhis motion for a change of venue and during voir dire\nexcused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin\u00ad\nguishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir\ndire of \u201csuch hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who\nserved in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not\nbe laid aside.\u201d 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors\n\u201chad a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur\u00ad\nphy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]\npast crimes,\u201d \u201cnone betrayed any belief in the relevance of\n[Murphy\u2019s] past to the present case.\u201d Ibid.; see also ibid.,\nn. 4 (contrasting a juror\u2019s \u201cmere familiarity with [a defen\u00ad\ndant] or his past\u201d with \u201can actual predisposition against\nhim\u201d). \u201c[T]hese indicia of impartiality,\u201d the Court sug\u00ad\ngested, \u201cmight be disregarded in a case where the general\natmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently\ninflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur\u00ad\nphy\u2019s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.\u201d Id., at 802.\n  In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant\nwas granted a new trial four years after being convicted of\nmurder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial\npublicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had\npreviously been convicted and had made confessions that\nwould be inadmissible in court. The state trial court\ndenied Yount\u2019s motion and seated a jury following a 10\u00ad\nday voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court\n\nviolates a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies\na for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on\nthe jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,\n316 (2000) (\u201c[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed\nfor cause . . . would require reversal\u201d).\n18               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nprospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent\n\u201cadmitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.\u201d\nId., at 1029. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas\nreview, this Court stressed the significant interval be\u00ad\ntween Yount\u2019s first trial\u2014when \u201cadverse publicity and the\ncommunity\u2019s sense of outrage were at their height\u201d\u2014and\nhis second trial, which \u201cdid not occur until four years later,\nat a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly dimin\u00ad\nished and community sentiment had softened.\u201d Id., at\n1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had\n\u201cat some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt,\u201d\nthe \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d voir dire confirmed that \u201ctime\nhad weakened or eliminated any\u201d bias they once may have\nharbored. Id., at 1029\u20131030, 1034, n. 10, 1033. Accord\u00ad\ningly, this Court concluded, \u201cthe trial court did not commit\nmanifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was\nimpartial.\u201d Id., at 1032.\n   This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of\npretrial publicity in Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415\n(1991). Mu\u2019Min stood accused of murdering a woman\nwhile out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper\narticles about the crime, Mu\u2019Min moved for a change of\nvenue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and at\u00ad\ntempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of\nthe 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard\nabout the case from media or other sources. Dividing\nthese prospective jurors into panels of four, the court\nasked further general questions about their ability to be\nfair given what they had heard or read. One juror an\u00ad\nswered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The\ncourt refused Mu\u2019Min\u2019s request to ask more specific ques\u00ad\ntions \u201crelating to the content of news items that potential\njurors might have read or seen.\u201d Id., at 419. Of the 12\npersons who served on the jury, \u201c8 had at one time or\nanother read or heard something about the case. None\nhad indicated that he had formed an opinion about the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncase or would be biased in any way.\u201d Id., at 421.\n   Rejecting Mu\u2019Min\u2019s attempt to analogize his case to\nIrvin, this Court observed that \u201cthe cases differ both in the\nkind of community in which the coverage took place and in\nextent of media coverage.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429. Mu\u2019Min\u2019s\noffense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,\narea, \u201cwhich has a population of over 3 million, and in\nwhich, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed\neach year.\u201d Ibid. While the crime garnered \u201csubstantial\u201d\npretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in\nIrvin and \u201cdid not contain the same sort of damaging\ninformation.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429\u2013430. Moreover, in con\u00ad\ntrast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed\nhaving ever formed an opinion about the case. Given\nthese circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu\u2019Min\u2019s asser\u00ad\ntion that the trial court committed constitutional error by\ndeclining to \u201cmake precise inquiries about the contents of\nany news reports that potential jurors have read.\u201d 500\nU. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling\nwas context-specific: \u201cHad the trial court in this case been\nconfronted with the \u2018wave of public passion\u2019 engendered by\npretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin\u2019s\ntrial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment might well have required more extensive examina\u00ad\ntion of potential jurors than it undertook here.\u201d Id., at\n429.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to determine how this case compares to\nour existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances\nso inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most\nscrupulous voir dire would have been \u201cbut a hollow formal\u00ad\nity\u201d incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373\nU. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac\u00ad\nter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process\nsufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and\n20              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncommunity animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable\nof presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial\ninfluences?\n                              A\n   Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that\nthe prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was\nnot so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District\nCourt acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\u2019s mo\u00ad\ntion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this\nconclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the\nsize and diversity of the Houston community make it\nprobable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number\nof persons who were unaffected by Enron\u2019s collapse, neu\u00ad\ntral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the\npublic furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while\nubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court\npoints out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or\nsimilar \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence of specific criminal acts.\nFor many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen\u00ad\ndant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the\npleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt\nsuggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds\nexposed to such information would not necessarily have\nformed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was\nguilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major\u00ad\nity of the county\u2019s residents were \u201cexposed repeatedly and\nin depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing\nin detail to the crimes with which he was later to be\ncharged\u201d). Third, there is no suggestion that the court\u00ad\nroom in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a\n\u201ccarnival\u201d in which the \u201ccalmness and solemnity\u201d of the\nproceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at\n358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus\nappropriate to examine the voir dire and determine\nwhether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the\n                       Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                        21\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\njury actually selected.9\n                                B\n   In concluding that the voir dire \u201cadequately detect[ed]\nand defuse[d] juror bias,\u201d ante, at 20, the Court downplays\nthe extent of the community\u2019s antipathy toward Skilling\nand exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.\nThe devastating impact of Enron\u2019s collapse and the relent\u00ad\nless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the\npart of the District Court to ensure the seating of an im\u00ad\npartial jury. While the procedures employed by the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court might have been adequate in the typical high\u00ad\nprofile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary\ncircumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling\u2019s constitu\u00ad\ntional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Whether   the District Court abused its discretion in declining to\nchange venue pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a\ndifferent question. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 21(a) (\u201cUpon the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that\ndefendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a\nprejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that\nthe defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there\u201d). As this\nCourt has indicated, its supervisory powers confer \u201cmore latitude\u201d to set\nstandards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 424 (1991). While the circumstances\nmay not constitutionally compel a change of venue \u201cwithout pausing to\nexamine . . . the voir dire,\u201d Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723, 727\n(1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the\ncommunity\u2019s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that\nthe task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major chal\u00ad\nlenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far\neasier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story\nhad less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c[i]t\nwould not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have\ngranted Skilling\u2019s transfer motion.\u201d 554 F. 3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009).\nSkilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers\nclaim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth\nCircuit, see id., at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. ante, at\n12, n. 11.\n22               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the \u201cwide\ndiscretion\u201d owed to trial courts when it comes to jury\u00ad\nrelated issues. Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20\u2013\n21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public\nsentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox\u00ad\nimity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons\nin the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.\n\u201c[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an\nindependent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d Sheppard,\n384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well\nqualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented\nprocedures adequate to keep community prejudices from\ninfecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not\nbefit the circumstances of the case, the trial court\u2019s rulings\non impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See\nMorgan, 504 U. S., at 729\u2013730 (\u201c \u2018Without an adequate\nvoir dire the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospec\u00ad\ntive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the\ncourt\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be\nfulfilled\u2019 \u201d (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451\nU. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also\nMu\u2019Min, 500 U.

For Houstonians, Enron\u2019s collapse was an event\nof once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the\nvolume of media coverage \u201cimmense\u201d and frequently in\u00ad\ntemperate, but \u201cthe sheer number of victims\u201d created a\nclimate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthe desire for conviction was widely shared. 554 F. 3d, at\n559\u2013560.\n   The level of public animus toward Skilling dwarfed that\npresent in cases such as Murphy and Mu\u2019Min. The pre\u00ad\ntrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news\nreports, most of which were \u201clargely factual in nature.\u201d\nMurphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no indication that\nthe relevant communities had been captivated by the\ncases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In\ncontrast, the number of media reports in this case reached\nthe tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of\nSkilling were common. The much closer analogy is thus to\nIrvin, which similarly featured a \u201cbarrage\u201d of media cover\u00ad\nage and a \u201chuge . . . wave of public passion,\u201d 366 U. S., at\n725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve\ndirect harm to entire segments of the community.10\n   Attempting to distinguish Irvin, the majority suggests\nthat Skilling\u2019s economic offenses were less incendiary than\nIrvin\u2019s violent crime spree and that \u201cnews stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor\u00ad\nmation rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies\nand murders.\u201d Ante, at 28. Along similar lines, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court described \u201cthe facts of this case [as] neither\nheinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to Brief for United States\n10a. The majority also points to the four years that\npassed between Enron\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy and the\nstart of Skilling\u2019s trial, asserting that \u201cthe decibel level of\nmedia attention diminished somewhat\u201d over this time.\nAnte, at 17. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n   First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread\ncommunity outrage more readily than crimes involving\nmonetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 10 One of Skilling\u2019s experts noted that, \u201c[i]n cases involving 200 or\n\nmore articles, trial judges granted a change of venue 59% of the time.\u201d\nApp. \u00b630, p. 611a.\n24                    SKILLING v.

Indeed, the record in this case is\nreplete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling\nand other Enron executives. See, e.g., Record 39946\n(front-page, eve-of-trial story describing \u201cthe hurt and\nanger and resentment . . . churn[ing] inside\u201d the people of\nHouston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other\nthings, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terror\u00ad\nist.11 As one commentator observed, \u201c[i]t\u2019s a sign of how\nshocked Houstonians are about Enron\u2019s ignominious\ndemise that Sept. 11 can be invoked\u2014and is frequently\u2014\nto explain the shock of the company\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp.\nRecord 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and\nother top executives hired private security to protect\nthemselves from persons inclined to take the law into their\nown hands. See, e.g., App. 1154a (\u201cAfter taking the tem\u00ad\nperature of Enron\u2019s victims, [a local lawyer] says the\nEnron executives are wise to take security precautions\u201d).\n   Second, the passage of time did little to soften commu\u00ad\nnity sentiment. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, ante,\nat 17, this case in no way resembles Yount, where, by the\ntime of the defendant\u2019s retrial, \u201cprejudicial publicity [had]\ngreatly diminished\u201d and community animus had signifi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 See, e.g., 554 F. 3d, at 559, n. 42 (\u201cI\u2019m livid, absolutely livid . . . .

The Enron\nstory was a continuing saga, and \u201cpublicity remained\nintense throughout.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 560. Not only did\nEnron\u2019s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but\nso too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related\nevents.12 Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty\nplea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling\u2019s\ntrial. If anything, the time that elapsed between the\nbankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an\nunbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members\nof the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related\nguilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their\ncertainty that Skilling too had engaged in\u2014if not master\u00ad\nminded\u2014criminal acts, particularly given that the media\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress,\n\nand other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights;\nEnron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and\nsentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force\ncharged Enron CFO and Skilling-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Andrew Fastow with fraud,\nmoney laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees\npleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task\nForce indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr.\n(the company\u2019s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant\ntreasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband\nServices; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received\nprison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.\nIn 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and\nCausey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding\nLay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered\nguilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers\nwere defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal\ninvolving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held\nin Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various\npretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay,\nand Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey\npleaded guilty to securities fraud.\n26                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncoverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7\u20138. The trial\nof Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had\ncome before. See Record 40002 (noting that \u201cprosecutors\nfollowed the classic pattern of working their way up\nthrough the ranks\u201d). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,\nshortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services\nexecutives ended without convictions, \u201cThe real trial, the\ntrue measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu\u00ad\nary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We\u2019ve got\nbigger fish in need of frying.\u201d App. 1460a (paragraph\nbreaks omitted); see also ibid. (\u201cFrom the beginning, the\nEnron prosecution has had one true measure of success:\nLay and Skilling in a cold steel cage\u201d).\n   Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston\ncommunity remained overwhelmingly negative was dis\u00ad\npelled by prospective jurors\u2019 responses to the written\nquestionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5\u20137,\nmore than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew\nvictims of Enron\u2019s collapse or were victims themselves,\nand two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen\u00ad\ndant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling\nwas palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of\nthe prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re\u00ad\nsponses. And this was before Causey\u2019s guilty plea and the\nflurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of\ntrial. One of Skilling\u2019s experts, a political scientist who\nhad studied pretrial publicity \u201cfor over 35 years\u201d and\nconsulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he\nhad recommended against venue changes more often than\nnot), \u201cc[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of\nbias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at\nleast one of the very highest I have ever encountered.\u201d\nApp. \u00b6\u00b62, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).\n                              2\n     Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n362. As this Court has recognized, \u201c[i]n a community\nwhere most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying preju\u00ad\ndice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations may be\ndrawn into question.\u201d Murphy, 421 U. S., at 803; see also\nGroppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 510 (1971) (\u201c \u2018[A]ny\njudge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms\nthey are extremely likely to be impregnated by the envi\u00ad\nroning atmosphere\u2019 \u201d (quoting Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.\n309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps be\u00ad\ncause it had underestimated the public\u2019s antipathy toward\nSkilling, the District Court\u2019s 5-hour voir dire was mani\u00ad\nfestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.13\n  As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the\n\nthree previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were simi\u00ad\nlarly brief. See ante, at 23. The circumstances of those cases, however,\nwere very different. In particular, the defendants had not been person\u00ad\nally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism\nthat had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, e.g.,\nsupra, at 25\u201326, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely\nseen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclu\u00ad\nsion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice\nto select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the\nprocesses used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.\n  Moreover, in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case, I do\nnot mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the\nadequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one,\nshould be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always\ntake care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a\ndefendant\u2019s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court\u00ad\nled versus attorney-led voir dire. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,\nand I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial\njury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the\nscope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.\n28                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npursued at all. The majority accepts, for instance, that\n\u201cpublicity about a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea calls for in\u00ad\nquiry to guard against actual prejudice.\u201d Ante, at 19.\nImplying that the District Court undertook this inquiry,\nthe majority states that \u201c[o]nly two venire members re\u00ad\ncalled [Causey\u2019s] plea.\u201d Ibid. In fact, the court asked very\nfew prospective jurors any questions directed to their\nknowledge of or feelings about that event.14 Considering\nhow much news the plea generated, many more than two\nvenire members were likely aware of it. The lack of ques\u00ad\ntioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea\non those jurors impossible to assess.\n   The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to de\u00ad\nscribe personal interactions they may have had about the\ncase, or to consider whether they might have difficulty\navoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or\ncolleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The\ntidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects\nprovided cause for concern. In response to general media\u00ad\nrelated questions, several prospective jurors volunteered\nthat they had spoken with others about the case. Juror\n74, for example, indicated that her husband was the \u201cnews\nperson,\u201d that they had \u201ctalked about it,\u201d that she had also\nheard things \u201cfrom work,\u201d and that what she heard was\n\u201call negative, of course.\u201d App. 948a. The court, however,\ndid not seek elaboration about the substance of these\ninteractions. Surely many prospective jurors had similar\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court\u2019s\n\nquestion about whether he \u201crecall[ed] listening to any particular\nprograms about the case.\u201d App. 888a. Juror 96, meanwhile, told the\ncourt that he read the \u201cwhole\u201d Houston Chronicle every day, including\n\u201call the articles about Enron.\u201d Id., at 992a. The court, however, did not\nask any questions designed to elicit information about the Causey plea.\nInstead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling\u2019s counsel\nmanaged to squeeze in a follow-up as to whether he had \u201cread about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two.\u201d Id., at 993a.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Yet this too was a subject\nthe District Court did not adequately explore. On the few\noccasions when prospective jurors were asked whether\nthey would feel pressure from the public to convict, they\nacknowledged that it might be difficult to return home\nafter delivering a not-guilty verdict. Juror 75, for in\u00ad\nstance, told the court, \u201cI think a lot of people feel that\nthey\u2019re guilty. And maybe they\u2019re expecting something to\ncome out of this trial.\u201d Id., at 956a. It would be \u201ctough,\u201d\nshe recognized, \u201cto vote not guilty and go back into the\ncommunity.\u201d Id., at 957a; see also id., at 852a (Juror 10)\n(admitting \u201csome hesitancy\u201d about \u201ctelling people the\ngovernment didn\u2019t prove its case\u201d).\n  With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the\nDistrict Court\u2019s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly\ntroubling.15 Although Juror 101 responded in the negative\nwhen asked whether she had \u201cread anything in the news\u00ad\npaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,\u201d she volunteered that\nshe \u201cjust heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling\nand Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and\nthat there was an insurance policy that they could collect\non, also.\u201d Id., at 998a. This information, she explained,\n\u201cwas just something I overheard today\u2014other jurors\ntalking.\u201d Ibid. It seemed suspicious, she intimated, \u201cto\nhave an insurance policy ahead of time.\u201d Id., at 999a. The\ncourt advised her that \u201cmost corporations provide insur\u00ad\nance for their officers and directors.\u201d Ibid. The court,\nhowever, did not investigate the matter further, even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Portions of the voir dire transcript erroneously refer to this pro\u00ad\n\nspective juror as \u201cJuror 110.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 996a.\n30                 SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthough it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to\ntalk to each other about the case. Id., at 843a. It is thus\nnot apparent whether other prospective jurors also over\u00ad\nheard the information and whether they too believed that\nit reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar\u00ad\nent what other outside information may have been shared\namong the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101\u2019s\nstatements indicate that the court\u2019s questions were failing\nto bring to light the extent of jurors\u2019 exposure to poten\u00ad\ntially prejudicial facts and that some prospec-\ntive jurors were having difficulty following the court\u2019s\ndirectives.\n   The topics that the District Court did cover were ad\u00ad\ndressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were\nasked just a few yes/no questions about their general\nexposure to media coverage and a handful of additional\nquestions concerning any responses to the written ques\u00ad\ntionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their\nanswers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely\nsought to draw them out with open-ended questions about\ntheir impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited\npatience for counsel\u2019s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Thecourt\u2019s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:\n  \u201cQ.

See\nid., at 863a (\u201c[H]e said he thought that he would find them\nguilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said\nthat it would be worse than a German trying to say that\nthey didn\u2019t kill the Jews\u201d).19 Other jurors may well have\nencountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary\nrhetoric.\n  These deficiencies in the form and content of the voir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 The  majority\u2019s criticism of Skilling\u2019s counsel for failing to ask ques\u00ad\ntions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. ante, at 23\u201324, is thus\nmisplaced. Given the District Court\u2019s express warning early in the voir\ndire that it would not allow counsel \u201cto ask individual questions if\n[they] abuse[d]\u201d that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for\ndeclining to test the court\u2019s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the\ncourt\u2019s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave\ncounsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.\n   18 Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the com\u00ad\n\nmunity hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial\npublicity, acknowledging that \u201call of us have been exposed to substan\u00ad\ntial media attention about this case.\u201d Id., at 841a. The court even\nmade an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions,\n\u201cthe Nigerian barge case,\u201d apparently expecting that the prospective\njurors would understand the reference. Id., at 840a.\n   19 Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective ju\u00ad\n\nrors, Juror 17 stated that he \u201cthought the guy [on the radio] was pretty\nnarrow minded,\u201d that \u201ceveryone should be considered innocent totally\nuntil they get a chance to come [to] court,\u201d and that the Government\nmight have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions.\nId., at 863a\u2013864a. He added, however, that he \u201cbelieve[d] there was\nprobably some accounting fraud [at Enron].\u201d Id., at 864a. The District\nCourt denied the Government\u2019s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,\nbut he did not ultimately sit on the jury.\n32                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ndire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment\nof prospective jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality. Although\nthe Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran\u00ad\nscript indicates that the District Court essentially took\njurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In\u00ad\ndeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec\u00ad\ntive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar\u00ad\ntiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.\nJuror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that\nSkilling was \u201cnot an honest man.\u201d App. 881a. During\nquestioning, she acknowledged having previously thought\nthe defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost\n$50,000\u2013$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that\nshe would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,\n884a. Noting that she \u201cblame[d] Enron for the loss of her\nmoney\u201d and appeared to have \u201cunshakeable bias,\u201d Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The\ncourt, however, declined to remove her, stating that \u201cshe\nanswered candidly she\u2019s going to have an open mind now\u201d\nand \u201cagree[ing]\u201d with the Government\u2019s assertion that \u201cwe\nhave to take her at her word.\u201d Id., at 885a\u2013886a.20 As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 The  majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by\nnoting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a\nperemptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 31. The\nmajority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members\nwho were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments\nof these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar\u00ad\ntiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly \u201cpart of a community\ndeeply hostile to the accused\u201d and who may have been \u201cunwittingly\ninfluenced by it.\u201d Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also\nIrvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the\nDistrict Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror\n29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it\nthrough to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi\u00ad\ndence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (\u201c[T]he juror\u2019s\nassurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi\u00ad\ntive of the accused\u2019s rights\u201d); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728\n(\u201cWhere so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a\nstatement of impartiality can be given little weight\u201d).\n   Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions\naccepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal\non their face. Prospective jurors who \u201chope[d]\u201d they could\npresume innocence and did \u201cnot necessarily\u201d think Skill\u00ad\ning was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.\n932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her\nquestionnaire, \u201cShame on him.\u201d Id., at 931a.

The\ncourt then asked, \u201ccan you presume, as you start this trial,\nthat Mr. Lay is innocent?\u201d Id., at 932a. She responded, \u201cI\nhope so, but you know. I don\u2019t know.

Cf. ante, at\n25. Jurors who did not \u201cget into details\u201d of Enron\u2019s com\u00ad\nplicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless\nknew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that\nSkilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.\nJuror 63, for instance, told the court that she \u201cmay have\nheard a little bit\u201d about Enron-related litigation but had\nnot \u201creally pa[id] attention.\u201d Id., at 935a. Yet she was\nclearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire,\ndespite stating that she had not followed Enron-related\nnews, she wrote about \u201cwhistleblowers and Arthur Ander\u00ad\nsen lying about Enron\u2019s accounting,\u201d and she expressed\nthe view that Skilling and Lay \u201cprobably knew they were\nbreaking the law.\u201d Supp. App. 105sa\u2013106sa. During\nquestioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District\nCourt obtained no meaningful information about the\nactual extent of Juror 63\u2019s familiarity with the case or the\nbasis for her belief in Skilling\u2019s guilt.

This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and\nalternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost\njobs or money as a result of Enron\u2019s collapse\u2014a fact that does not strike\nme as particularly reassuring.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

App. 937a.22\n   Indeed, the District Court\u2019s anemic questioning did little\nto dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numer\u00ad\nous other seated jurors and alternates. In my estimation,\nmore than half of those seated made written and oral\ncomments suggesting active antipathy toward the defen\u00ad\ndants. The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts\nthat \u201cSkilling\u2019s seated jurors . . . exhibited nothing like the\ndisplay of bias shown in Irvin.\u201d Ante, at 29. Juror 10, for\ninstance, reported on his written questionnaire that he\nknew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he\npersonally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual\nfund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from\nthe \u201cHouston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels,\nFox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]\nTexas Lawyer Magazine\u201d; that he believed Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse \u201cwas due to greed and mismanagement\u201d; that \u201c[i]f\n[Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he\nwas really a poor manager/leader\u201d; and that the defen\u00ad\ndants were \u201csuspect.\u201d Supp. App. 11sa\u201319sa. During\nquestioning, he said he \u201cth[ought]\u201d he could presume\ninnocence and \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he could put the Government to\nits proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have\n\u201csome hesitancy\u201d \u201cin telling people the government didn\u2019t\nprove its case.\u201d App. 851a\u2013852a.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 As one of Skilling\u2019s jury experts observed, there is a \u201ctendency in\nvoir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their\nexposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any\nbiases they may have.\u201d App. 763a; see also id., at 637a (\u201cThose who\nperceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluc\u00ad\ntant to admit they cannot be fair\u201d).

Juror 13, for\ninstance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard\nabout the Enron cases from the \u201c[n]ews.\u201d Supp. App. 42sa.\nThe court questioned him for two minutes, during which\ntime he confirmed that he had \u201cheard what\u2019s on the news,\nbasically,\u201d including \u201cthat the trial had moved from the\n17th to the 31st.\u201d He added that the story \u201cwas all over\nthe news on every detail of Enron.\u201d App. 858a\u2013860a.

The court ques\u00ad\ntioned her for less than 90 seconds.

When the District\nCourt asked the prospective jurors as a group whether\nthey had any reservations about their ability to presume\ninnocence and put the Government to its proof, only two\nanswered in the affirmative, and both were excused for\ncause. Id., at 815a\u2013820a. The District Court\u2019s individual\nquestioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying\nprejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors\nwho had earlier expressed no concerns about their impar\u00ad\ntiality. See n. 7, supra. It thus strikes me as highly likely\nthat at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that\nthey could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more\nprobing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. Yount,\n467 U. S., at 1034, n. 10 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cparticularly extensive\u201d 10-day voir dire assured the jury\u2019s\nimpartiality).25\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nquestionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle and\n\u201cInternet news sources.\u201d Id., at 133sa.

Juror 99 wrote that she had not\nheard or read about the Enron cases and did not \u201cknow anything about\u201d\nEnron. Supp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely\none minute. She stated that she had \u201c[n]ot really\u201d learned more about\nthe case, but added that she had heard \u201cthis and that\u201d from her par\u00ad\nents. App. 995a\u2013996a. The court did not press further.\n  25 The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling \u201cchallenged only\n\none of the seated jurors for cause\u201d indicates that he did not believe the\nother jurors were biased. Ante, at 30. Our decisions, however, distin\u00ad\nguish claims involving \u201cthe partiality of an individual juror\u201d from\nantecedent claims directed at \u201cthe partiality of the trial jury as a\nwhole.\u201d Patton v.

This argument,\nhowever, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vin\u00ad\ndictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely\nbelieve in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor\ndisqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit\nwhere evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously\nresolving closer calls against the defendant rather than\ngiving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf. United States v.\nMcVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (preju\u00ad\ndice \u201cmay go unrecognized in those who are affected by it.\nThe prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a\nbias or discriminatory attitude.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131394. Argued March 1, 2010\u2014Decided June 24, 2010\nFounded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in\n  Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company\n  in America. Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was\n  Enron\u2019s chief executive officer from February until August 2001,\n  when he resigned. Less than four months later, Enron crashed into\n  bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value. After an investigation\n  uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron\u2019s stock prices by\n  overstating the company\u2019s financial well-being, the Government\n  prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the\n  scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of\n  command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.\n  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme\n  to deceive investors about Enron\u2019s true financial performance by ma\n  nipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false\n  and misleading statements. Count 1 of the indictment charged Skill\n  ing with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit \u201chonest-services\u201d wire\n  fraud, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its\n  shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services. Skilling\n  was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud,\n  wire fraud, making false representations to Enron\u2019s auditors, and in\n  sider trading.\n     In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contend\n  ing that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pre\n  trial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. He submitted hundreds\n  of news reports detailing Enron\u2019s downfall, as well as affidavits from\n  experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in\n  comparison to other potential venues. The District Court denied the\n  motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presump\n2                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\n    Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed,\n    media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional,\n    and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational. More\n    over, the court asserted, effective voir dire would detect juror bias.\n       In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for ques\n    tions it might use to screen prospective jurors. Rejecting the Gov\n    ernment\u2019s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling\u2019s more probing and\n    specific questions, the court converted Skilling\u2019s submission, with\n    slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document. The\n    questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news\n    and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron\n    and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and\n    their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\n    and to anyone affected by its demise. The court then mailed the\n    questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from\n    nearly all of them. It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 indi\n    viduals, and the parties, with the court\u2019s approval, further winnowed\n    the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical dis\n    ability. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospec\n    tive juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the de\n    fendants would prevent her from being impartial.\n       In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skill\n    ing\u2019s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty. Skilling re\n    newed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror question\n    naires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey\u2019s\n    guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. The court again declined to\n    move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided\n    safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. The court also de\n    nied Skilling\u2019s request for attorney-led voir dire on the ground that\n    potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with law\n    yers. But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask\n    follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined\n    individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants\n    jointly two extra peremptory challenges.\n       Voir dire began in January 2006. After questioning the venire as a\n    group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking\n    each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any\n    stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers\n    that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permit\n    ted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties\u2019\n    challenges for cause. Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective\n    jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to\n    empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.

S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud\n  conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.\n     On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here. First, he\n  contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented\n  him from obtaining a fair trial. Second, he alleged that the jury im\n  properly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire\n  fraud. As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that\n  the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\u2019s\n  collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. Stating, however,\n  that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the voir dire,\n  found it \u201cproper and thorough,\u201d and held that the District Court had\n  empaneled an impartial jury. The Court of Appeals also rejected\n  Skilling\u2019s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to\n  commit honest-services fraud. It did not address Skilling\u2019s argument\n  that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his ac\n  tions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.\nHeld:\n    1. Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skill\n ing from obtaining a fair trial. He did not establish that a presump\n tion of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\n tried him. Pp. 11\u201334.\n       (a) The District Court did not err in denying Skilling\u2019s requests\n for a venue transfer. Pp. 11\u201319.\n         (1) Although the Sixth Amendment and Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 3, pro\n vide for criminal trials in the State and district where the crime was\n committed, these place-of-trial prescriptions do not impede transfer\n of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice\n will prevent a fair trial. Pp. 11\u201312.\n         (2) The foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice\n from which the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis proceeded is Rideau v. Louisi\n ana, 373 U. S. 723. Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kid\n naped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interro\n gated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his\n confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised\n three times to large local audiences shortly before trial. After the\n Louisiana trial court denied Rideau\u2019s change-of-venue motion, he was\n convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal. This\n Court reversed. \u201c[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and\n heard it,\u201d the Court explained, the interrogation \u201cin a very real sense\n was Rideau\u2019s trial\u2014at which he pleaded guilty.\u201d             Id., at 726.\n \u201c[W]ithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire,\u201d the Court held that\n the \u201ckangaroo court proceedings\u201d trailing the televised confession vio\n lated due process. Id., at 726\u2013727. The Court followed Rideau in two\n other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal\n4                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    prosecutions. However, it later explained that those decisions \u201ccan\n    not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . .\n    news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the de\n    fendant of due process.\u201d Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 798\u2013799.\n    Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror\n    impartiality does not require ignorance. See, e.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366\n    U. S. 717, 722. A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme\n    case. Pp. 12\u201316.\n           (3) Important differences separate Skilling\u2019s prosecution from\n    those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice. First, the\n    Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community\n    in which the crime occurred. In contrast to the small-town setting in\n    Rideau, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation\u2019s\n    fourth most populous city. Given the large, diverse pool of residents\n    eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals\n    could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain. Second, al\n    though news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no\n    blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau\u2019s dramatically\n    staged admission of guilt. Third, unlike Rideau and other cases in\n    which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years\n    elapsed between Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and Skilling\u2019s trial. Although\n    reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the\n    decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years\n    following Enron\u2019s collapse. Finally, and of prime significance, Skill\n    ing\u2019s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly,\n    earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelm\n    ing victory for the Government. It would be odd for an appellate\n    court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run\n    counter to that presumption. Pp. 16\u201318.\n           (4) The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily\n    on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed\n    at Enron. But \u201cpretrial publicity\u2014even pervasive, adverse public\n    ity\u2014does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d Nebraska Press\n    Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 554. Here, news stories about Enron\n    did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court\n    has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Hous\n    ton\u2019s size and diversity diluted the media\u2019s impact. Nor did Enron\u2019s\n    sheer number of victims trigger a presumption. Although the wide\n    spread community impact necessitated careful identification and in\n    spection of prospective jurors\u2019 connections to Enron, the extensive\n    screening questionnaire and follow-up voir dire yielded jurors whose\n    links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated. Finally, while\n    Causey\u2019s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial\n    created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropri\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nate steps to mitigate that risk. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     (b) No actual prejudice contaminated Skilling\u2019s jury. The Court\nrejects Skilling\u2019s assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect\nand defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.\nPp. 20\u201334.\n       (1) No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or\nbreadth of voir dire. Jury selection is \u201cparticularly within the prov\nince of the trial judge.\u201d Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594\u2013595.\nWhen pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, \u201cprimary reliance on\nthe judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense\u201d be\ncause the judge \u201csits in the locale where the publicity is said to have\nhad its effect\u201d and may base her evaluation on her \u201cown perception of\nthe depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.\u201d\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427. The Court considers the ade\nquacy of jury selection in Skilling\u2019s case attentive to the respect due\nto district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the\nmeasures necessary to ensure that impartiality. Pp. 20\u201321.\n       (2) Skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of consti\ntutional requirements. The jury-selection process was insufficient,\nSkilling maintains, because voir dire lasted only five hours, most of\nthe District Court\u2019s questions were conclusory and failed adequately\nto probe jurors\u2019 true feelings, and the court consistently took prospec\ntive jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no mat\nter any other indications of bias. This Court\u2019s review of the record,\nhowever, yields a different appraisal. The District Court initially\nscreened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehen\nsive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey\nhelped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served\nas a springboard for further questions; voir dire thus was the culmi\nnation of a lengthy process. Moreover, inspection of the question\nnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstand\ning the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors\nlargely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the\ncorporation\u2019s collapse. Whatever community prejudice existed in\nHouston generally, Skilling\u2019s jurors were not under its sway. Relying\non Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S., at 727\u2013728, Skilling asserts the District\nCourt should not have accepted jurors\u2019 promises of fairness. But a\nnumber of factors show that the District Court had far less reason\nthan the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors\u2019 assurances of imparti\nality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the\nhorrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin\u2019s rampage of\nrobberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the ru\nral community in which Irvin\u2019s trial proceeded; circulation figures for\nHouston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n6                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    recorded in Irvin; and Skilling\u2019s seated jurors exhibited nothing like\n    the display of bias shown in Irvin. In any event, the District Court\n    did not simply take venire members at their word. It questioned\n    each juror individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face\n    opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with informa\n    tion from the questionnaires regarding jurors\u2019 backgrounds, opinions,\n    and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fit\n    ness for jury service. Pp. 22\u201330.\n            (3) Skilling\u2019s allegation that several jurors were openly biased\n    also fails. In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district\n    courts is at its pinnacle: \u201c \u2018A trial court\u2019s findings of juror impartiality\n    may be overturned only for manifest error.\u2019 \u201d Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at\n    428. Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the\n    seated jurors for cause, \u201cstrong evidence that he was convinced the\n    [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to\n    his guilt.\u201d Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557\u2013558. A review of\n    the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Ju\n    rors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, inter alia, that he or she\n    would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove\n    its case. Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded\n    with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no\n    signs of prejudice this Court can discern. Pp. 31\u201334.\n       2. Section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of \u201cthe\n    intangible right of honest services,\u201d is properly confined to cover only\n    bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling\u2019s alleged misconduct\n    entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within the Court\u2019s con\n    finement of \u00a71346\u2019s proscription. Pp. 34\u201351.\n          (a) To place Skilling\u2019s claim that \u00a71346 is unconstitutionally\n    vague in context, the Court reviews the origin and subsequent appli\n    cation of the honest-services doctrine. Pp. 34\u201338.\n            (1) In a series of decisions beginning in the 1940s, the Courts\n    of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the mail-fraud statute\u2019s\n    prohibition of \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud\u201d to include depriva\n    tions not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.\n    See, e.g., Shushan v. United States, 117 F. 2d 110, which stimulated\n    the development of the \u201chonest-services\u201d doctrine. Unlike traditional\n    fraud, in which the victim\u2019s loss of money or property supplied the de\n    fendant\u2019s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest\n    services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.\n    While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no depriva\n    tion of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been\n    deceived, provided the enrichment. Even if the scheme occasioned a\n    money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, ac\n    tionable harm lay in the denial of that party\u2019s right to the offender\u2019s\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\u201chonest services.\u201d Most often these cases involved bribery of public\nofficials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the\ndoctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to\nhis employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks. By 1982, all\nCourts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.\nPp. 34\u201337.\n        (2) In 1987, this Court halted the development of the intangi\nble-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360,\nwhich held that the mail-fraud statute was \u201climited in scope to the\nprotection of property rights.\u201d \u201cIf Congress desires to go further,\u201d the\nCourt stated, \u201cit must speak more clearly.\u201d Ibid. P. 37.\n        (3) Congress responded the next year by enacting \u00a71346, which\nprovides: \u201cFor the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the U. S. Code that\nprohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, \u00a71341, and wire fraud, \u00a71343], the\nterm \u2018scheme or artifice to defraud\u2019 includes a scheme or artifice to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\u201d Pp 37\u201338.\n     (b) Section 1346, properly confined to core cases, is not unconsti\ntutionally vague. Pp. 38\u201351.\n        (1) To satisfy due process, \u201ca penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people\ncan understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that\ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357. The void-for-vagueness doc\ntrine embraces these requirements. Skilling contends that \u00a71346\nmeets neither of the two due-process essentials. But this Court must,\nif possible, construe, not condemn, Congress\u2019 enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571. Alert to\n\u00a71346\u2019s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how\nbest to interpret the statute. Uniformly, however, they have declined\nto throw out the statute as irremediably vague. This Court agrees\nthat \u00a71346 should be construed rather than invalidated. P. 38\u201339.\n        (2) The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally\ncases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe in\ntangible right of honest services.\u201d There is no doubt that Congress\nintended \u00a71346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doc\ntrine recognized in Courts of Appeals\u2019 decisions before McNally de\nrailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. Congress, it bears em\nphasis, enacted \u00a71346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision\u2019s terminology. See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.\nPp. 39\u201340.\n        (3) To preserve what Congress certainly intended \u00a71346 to\ncover, the Court pares the pre-McNally body of precedent down to its\ncore: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes\nto deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks\n8                    SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. In parsing the\n    various pre-McNally decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skill\n    ing\u2019s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\n    were not models of clarity or consistency. It has long been the\n    Court\u2019s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as imper\n    missibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a\n    limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n    657. Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends\n    that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core be\n    cause the pre-McNally cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.\n    This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in Letter Carriers,\n    413 U. S., at 571\u2013572. Although some applications of the pre-\n    McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the\n    Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast\n    majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary\n    duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. Indeed, McNally\n    itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U. S., at\n    352\u2013353, 360. In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress\n    intended \u00a71346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Because read\n    ing the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would\n    raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that \u00a71346 criminalizes\n    only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.\n    Pp. 41\u201345.\n            (4) The Government urges the Court to go further by reading\n    \u00a71346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self\n    dealing by a public official or private employee. Neither of the Gov\n    ernment\u2019s arguments in support of this position withstands close in\n    spection. Contrary to the first, McNally itself did not center on non\n    disclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a\n    classic kickback scheme. See 483 U. S., at 352\u2013353, 360. Reading\n    \u00a71346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks\u2014and nothing more\u2014\n    satisfies Congress\u2019 undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n    Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the\n    pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of\n    the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\n    honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they\n    reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. Given the relative\n    infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies\n    they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting con\n    struction of \u00a71346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.\n    Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that \u201cambigu\n    ity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in\n    favor of lenity.\u201d Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25. The\n    Court therefore resists the Government\u2019s less constrained construc\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion of \u00a71346 absent Congress\u2019 clear instruction otherwise. \u201cIf Con\n  gress desires to go further,\u201d the Court reiterates, \u201cit must speak more\n  clearly than it has.\u201d McNally, 483 U. S., at 360. Pp. 45\u201347.\n          (5) Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback\n  schemes, \u00a71346 is not unconstitutionally vague. A prohibition on\n  fraudulently depriving another of one\u2019s honest services by accepting\n  bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary\n  prosecution problem. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. As to fair no\n  tice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute\n  honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101,\n  and the statute\u2019s mens rea requirement further blunts any notice\n  concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101\u2013104. As\n  to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that\n  the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out\n  of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not\n  only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes\n  proscribing and defining similar crimes. Pp. 48\u201349.\n       (c) Skilling did not violate \u00a71346, as the Court interprets the\n  statute. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to de\n  fraud Enron\u2019s shareholders by misrepresenting the company\u2019s fiscal\n  health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he\n  solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for\n  making these misrepresentations. Because the indictment alleged\n  three objects of the conspiracy\u2014honest-services wire fraud, money\n  or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud\u2014Skilling\u2019s conviction is\n  flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298. This determina\n  tion, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy\n  conviction, for errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless\n  error analysis. The Court leaves the parties\u2019 dispute about whether\n  the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the\n  question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of\n  Skilling\u2019s other convictions.

UNITED \n\n                    STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest\u00ad\nrevenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bank\u00ad\nruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising\nfrom the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron\nexecutive, for crimes committed before the corporation\u2019s\ncollapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community\nprejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?\nSecond, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of con\u00ad\nspiracy to commit \u201chonest-services\u201d wire fraud, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7371, 1343, 1346?\n   Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed Skilling\u2019s convictions. We conclude, in common\nwith the Court of Appeals, that Skilling\u2019s fair-trial argu\u00ad\nment fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a\npresumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias\ninfected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the\nFifth Circuit\u2019s honest-services ruling.      In proscribing\nfraudulent deprivations of \u201cthe intangible right of honest\nservices,\u201d \u00a71346, Congress intended at least to reach\nschemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Con\u00ad\n2               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstruing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that\ncore meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness\nshoal. We therefore hold that \u00a71346 covers only bribery\nand kickback schemes. Because Skilling\u2019s alleged miscon\u00ad\nduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within\n\u00a71346\u2019s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and\nvacate in part.\n                              I\n   Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its\nheadquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world\u2019s\nleading energy companies. Skilling launched his career\nthere in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company\u2019s founder,\nhired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily\nrose through the corporation\u2019s ranks, serving as president\nand chief operating officer, and then, beginning in Febru\u00ad\nary 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on\nAugust 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.\n   Less than four months after Skilling\u2019s departure, Enron\nspiraled into bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock, which had\ntraded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to\npennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend\nwhat caused the corporation\u2019s collapse, the U. S. Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising\nprosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation. The\nGovernment\u2019s investigation uncovered an elaborate con\u00ad\nspiracy to prop up Enron\u2019s short-run stock prices by over\u00ad\nstating the company\u2019s financial well-being. In the years\nfollowing Enron\u2019s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted\ndozens of Enron employees who participated in the\nscheme. In time, the Government worked its way up the\ncorporation\u2019s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand\njury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron\u2019s\nformer chief accounting officer.\n   These three defendants, the indictment alleged,\n    \u201cengaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the in\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

To support this assertion, Skill\u00ad\ning, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news\nreports detailing Enron\u2019s downfall; he also presented\naffidavits from the experts he engaged portraying commu\u00ad\nnity attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential\nvenues.\n   The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or\n\nwires in furtherance of \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtain\u00ad\ning money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.\u201d 18 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted\nEnron-related prosecutions,2 denied the venue-transfer\nmotion. Despite \u201cisolated incidents of intemperate com\u00ad\nmentary,\u201d the court observed, media coverage \u201cha[d]\n[mostly] been objective and unemotional,\u201d and the facts of\nthe case were \u201cneither heinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to\nBrief for United States 10a\u201311a.3 Moreover, \u201ccourts ha[d]\ncommonly\u201d favored \u201ceffective voir dire . . . to ferret out any\n[juror] bias.\u201d Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case,\nthe court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that\nSkilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.\nId., at 22a.\n   In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court\nsolicited from the parties questions the court might use to\nscreen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a ques-\ntionnaire\u2019s format and content, Skilling and the Govern\u00ad\nment submitted dueling documents.

Three judges residing in the area thus\nindependently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could\nobtain a fair trial in Houston.\n   3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding En\u00ad\n\nron\u2019s collapse, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s opinion relies heavily on affidavits\nof media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support\nof his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 2, 3, 4, 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 5, n. 2, and\n23, n. 10; post, at 26, and 35, n. 22. These Skilling-employed experts\nselected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories.\nBut the District Court Judge did not find the experts\u2019 samples repre\u00ad\nsentative of the coverage at large; having \u201c[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed]\nall of the evidence\u201d Skilling presented, the court concluded that \u201cinci\u00ad\ndents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language\u201d were\ndwarfed by \u201cthe largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.\u201d App. to\nBrief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a.

The court converted Skilling\u2019s submis\u00ad\nsion, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page\ndocument that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia,\ntheir sources of news and exposure to Enron-related pub\u00ad\nlicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its col\u00ad\nlapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possi\u00ad\nble guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company\nand to anyone affected by its demise.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Questions included the following: \u201cWhat are your opinions about the\ncompensation that executives of large corporations receive?\u201d; \u201cHave\nyou, any family members, or friends ever worked for or applied for work\nwith,\u201d \u201cdone business with,\u201d or \u201cowned stock in Enron Corporation or\nany Enron subsidiaries and partnership?\u201d; \u201cDo you know anyone . . .\nwho has been negatively affected or hurt in any way by what happened\nat Enron?\u201d; \u201cDo you have an opinion about the cause of the collapse of\nEnron?

The court granted hard\u00ad\nship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at\n11773\u201311774, and the parties, with the court\u2019s approval,\nfurther winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for\ncause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891,\n13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, \u201ceach\nand every\u201d prospective juror who said that a preexisting\nopinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her\nfrom impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at\n13668.\n   On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date\nscheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded\nguilty. Skilling\u2019s attorneys immediately requested a con\u00ad\ntinuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the pro\u00ad\nceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In\nthe interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion,\narguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive\nbias and that news accounts of Causey\u2019s guilty plea fur\u00ad\nther tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial\nvenue, Skilling urged that \u201cjurors need to be questioned\nindividually by both the Court and counsel\u201d concerning\ntheir opinions of Enron and \u201cpublicity issues.\u201d Id., at\n12074.\n   The District Court again declined to move the trial.\nSkilling, the court concluded, still had not \u201cestablish[ed]\nthat pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d]\na presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d Id., at 14115.\nThe questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed,\nprovided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence\npresented during the trial of . . .

I get more forthcoming responses from\n     potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I\n     don\u2019t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers\u2014\n     but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a\n     candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the\n     question.\u201d Id., at 11805.\nBut the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to\nask follow-up questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire\nmembers should be examined individually about pretrial\npublicity, id., at 11051\u201311053. The court also allotted the\ndefendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than\nthe standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Crimi\u00ad\nnal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673\u201313675.\n   Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court\nfirst emphasized to the venire the importance of impartial\u00ad\nity and explained the presumption of innocence and the\nGovernment\u2019s burden of proof. The trial, the court next\ninstructed, was not a forum \u201cto seek vengeance against\nEnron\u2019s former officers,\u201d or to \u201cprovide remedies for\u201d its\nvictims. App. 823a. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d the court stressed,\n\u201cis that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, consci\u00ad\nentiously and impartially serve if selected.\u201d Id., at 823a\u2013\n824a. In response to the court\u2019s query whether any pro\u00ad\nspective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these\ninstructions, two individuals indicated that they could not\nbe fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a,\n819a\u2013820a.\n   After questioning the venire as a group,5 the District\nCourt brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward\n\nthe victims of Enron\u2019s collapse or a desire to see justice done would\noverpower prospective jurors\u2019 impartiality.

Although the questions var\u00ad\nied, the process generally tracked the following format:\nThe court asked about exposure to Enron-related news\nand the content of any stories that stood out in the pro\u00ad\nspective juror\u2019s mind. Next, the court homed in on ques\u00ad\ntionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible\nbias. The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up\nquestions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away,\nthe court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.\nIn all, the court granted one of the Government\u2019s for-\ncause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the\ndefendants\u2019 challenges and denied six. The parties agreed\nto excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for\nhardship.\n   By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 pro\u00ad\nspective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremp\u00ad\ntory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.6\nBefore the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the\nseating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in\nfact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 Selection\n              procedures of similar style and duration took place in\nthree Enron-related criminal cases earlier prosecuted in Houston\u2014\nUnited States v.

The District Court\nsentenced Skilling to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019\nsupervised release, and $45 million in restitution.\n  On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his\nconvictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services\narguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the\nFifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and\nnegative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\u2019s\ncollapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554\nF. 3d 529, 559 (2009).8 The court also noted potential\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Skilling had requested an additional peremptory strike each time\n\nthe District Court rejected a for-cause objection. The court, which had\nalready granted two extra peremptories, see supra, at 7, denied each\nrequest.\n   8 The Fifth Circuit described the media coverage as follows:\n\n   \u201cLocal newspapers ran many personal interest stories in which\nsympathetic individuals expressed feelings of anger and betrayal\ntoward Enron. . . . Even the [Houston] Chronicle\u2019s sports page wrote of\nSkilling\u2019s guilt as a foregone conclusion. Similarly, the Chronicle\u2019s\n\u2018Pethouse Pet of the Week\u2019 section mentioned that a pet had \u2018enjoyed\nwatching those Enron jerks being led away in handcuffs.\u2019 These are\nbut a few examples of the Chronicle\u2019s coverage.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 559\n(footnote omitted).\n10               SKILLING v.

Id., at 559\u2013\n560.\n   The Court of Appeals stated, however, that \u201cthe pre\u00ad\nsumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,\u201d and it therefore\nexamined the voir dire to determine whether \u201cthe District\nCourt empanelled an impartial jury.\u201d Id., at 561 (internal\nquotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).\nThe voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cproper and\nthorough.\u201d Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skill-\ning had challenged only one seated juror\u2014Juror 11\u2014for\ncause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments\nabout corporate greed, the District Court \u201cobserved [his]\ndemeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would\nmake the government prove its case.\u201d Id., at 564. In sum,\nthe Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome\nthe presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not\n\u201cshow[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced\nagainst him.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling\u2019s claim that\nhis conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit\nhonest-services fraud. \u201c[T]he jury was entitled to convict\nSkilling,\u201d the court stated, \u201con these elements\u201d: \u201c(1) a\nmaterial breach of a fiduciary duty . . . (2) that results in a\ndetriment to the employer,\u201d including one occasioned by\nan employee\u2019s decision to \u201cwithhold material information,\ni.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a\nreasonable employer to change its conduct.\u201d Id., at 547.\nThe Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling\u2019s argument that\nthe honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude\nhis actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally\nvague.

We\ngranted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), and now affirm in\npart, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.9\nWe consider first Skilling\u2019s allegation of juror prejudice,\nand next, his honest-services argument.\n                              II\n  Pointing to \u201cthe community passion aroused by Enron\u2019s\ncollapse and the vitriolic media treatment\u201d aimed at him,\nSkilling argues that his trial \u201cnever should have proceeded\nin Houston.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 20. And even if it had\nbeen possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, \u201c[t]he\ntruncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out\nprejudices,\u201d he contends, so \u201c[f]ar from rebutting the pre\u00ad\nsumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively\nconfirmed it.\u201d Id., at 21. Skilling\u2019s fair-trial claim thus\nraises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court\nerr by failing to move the trial to a different venue based\non a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual preju\u00ad\ndice contaminate Skilling\u2019s jury?10\n                        A\n                        1\n  The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 We   also granted certiorari and heard arguments this Term in two\nother cases raising questions concerning the honest-services statute\u2019s\nscope. See Black v. United States, No. 08\u2013876; Weyhrauch v. United\nStates, No. 08\u20131196. Today we vacate and remand those decisions in\nlight of this opinion. Black, post, p. ___; Weyhrauch, post, p. ___.\n   10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of preju\u00ad\n\ndice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when,\nif ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Al\u00ad\nthough we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we\nconsider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the\nquestion we agreed to decide. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a).\n12                   SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe right to trial by an impartial jury.

See\nPlatt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U.

S. 454,\n462 (1907) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.). When\ndoes the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal\ndim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due proc\u00ad\ness requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence?\nBecause most cases of consequence garner at least some\npretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in\ndiverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing\nthe presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Skilling\u2019s case proceeded. The founda\u00ad\ntion precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723\n(1963).\n   Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana\ntown, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of\nthem. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel\npresent and obtained his confession. Without informing\nRideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the\ninterrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before\nthe trial, a local television station broadcast the film to\naudiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.\nRideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could\nnot receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime oc\u00ad\ncurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000\npeople. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury\neventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Lou\u00ad\nisiana upheld the conviction.\n   We reversed. \u201cWhat the people [in the community] saw\non their television sets,\u201d we observed, \u201cwas Rideau, in jail,\nflanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in\ndetail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and\nmurder.\u201d Id., at 725. \u201c[T]o the tens of thousands of people\nwho saw and heard it,\u201d we explained, the interrogation \u201cin\na very real sense was Rideau\u2019s trial\u2014at which he pleaded\nguilty.\u201d Id., at 726. We therefore \u201cd[id] not hesitate to\nhold, without pausing to examine a particularized tran\u00ad\n14                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscript of the voir dire,\u201d that \u201c[t]he kangaroo court proceed\u00ad\nings\u201d trailing the televised confession violated due process.\nId., at 726\u2013727.\n    We followed Rideau\u2019s lead in two later cases in which\nmedia coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.\nIn Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 538 (1965), extensive\npublicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure\nduring preliminary court proceedings as reporters and\ntelevision crews overran the courtroom and \u201cbombard[ed]\n. . . the community with the sights and sounds of\u201d the\npretrial hearing. The media\u2019s overzealous reporting ef\u00ad\nforts, we observed, \u201cled to considerable disruption\u201d and\ndenied the \u201cjudicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol\nEstes] was entitled.\u201d Id., at 536.\n    Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nnews reporters extensively covered the story of Sam\nSheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant\nwife to death. \u201c[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during\nthe trial and newsmen took over practically the entire\ncourtroom,\u201d thrusting jurors \u201cinto the role of celebrities.\u201d\nId., at 353, 355. Pretrial media coverage, which we char\u00ad\nacterized as \u201cmonths [of] virulent publicity about\nSheppard and the murder,\u201d did not alone deny due proc\u00ad\ness, we noted. Id., at 354. But Sheppard\u2019s case involved\nmore than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder\nconviction because a \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d pervaded the\ntrial, id., at 358.\n    In each of these cases, we overturned a \u201cconviction\nobtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted\nby press coverage\u201d; our decisions, however, \u201ccannot be\nmade to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to\n. . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively\ndeprives the defendant of due process.\u201d Murphy v. Flor\nida, 421 U. S. 794, 798\u2013799 (1975).12 See also, e.g., Patton\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 12 Murphy   involved the robbery prosecution of the notorious Jack\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S. 1025 (1984).13 Prominence does not\nnecessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality, we\nhave reiterated, does not require ignorance. Irvin v.\nDowd, 366 U. S. 717, 722 (1961) (Jurors are not required\nto be \u201ctotally ignorant of the facts and issues involved\u201d;\n\u201cscarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will\nnot have formed some impression or opinion as to the\nmerits of the case.\u201d); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S.\n145, 155\u2013156 (1879) (\u201c[E]very case of public interest is\nalmost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention\nof all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely\nany one can be found among those best fitted for jurors\nwho has not read or heard of it, and who has not some\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMurphy, a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the 1964 heist\nof the Star of India sapphire from New York\u2019s American Museum of\nNatural History. Pointing to \u201cextensive press coverage\u201d about him,\nMurphy moved to transfer venue. 421 U. S., at 796. The trial court\ndenied the motion and a jury convicted Murphy. We affirmed. Mur\u00ad\nphy\u2019s trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings\nat issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723 (1963), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966),\nwhich \u201centirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a\ndefendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of\nfairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.\u201d 421 U. S., at 799. Voir dire\nrevealed no great hostility toward Murphy; \u201c[s]ome of the jurors had a\nvague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each\nhad some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief\nin the relevance of [his] past to the present case.\u201d Id., at 800 (footnote\nomitted).\n  13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount\u2019s confession to a brutal\n\nmurder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed\ndue to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). During\nvoir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an\nopinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates\nadmitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt. 467 U. S., at\n1029\u20131030.       Nevertheless, we rejected Yount\u2019s presumption-of\u00ad\nprejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we\nnoted, were at their height prior to Yount\u2019s first trial, four years before\nthe second prosecution; time had helped \u201csooth[e] and eras[e]\u201d commu\u00ad\nnity prejudice, id., at 1034.\n16                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nimpression or some opinion in respect to its merits.\u201d). A\npresumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends\nonly the extreme case.\n                             3\n   Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling as\u00ad\nserts that we need not pause to examine the screening\nquestionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury\u2019s\nverdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differ\u00ad\nences separate Skilling\u2019s prosecution from those in which\nwe have presumed juror prejudice.14\n   First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size\nand characteristics of the community in which the crime\noccurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the mur\u00ad\nder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.\nHouston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in\nthe Nation: At the time of Skilling\u2019s trial, more than 4.5\nmillion individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the\nHouston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of\npotential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial indi\u00ad\nviduals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 429 (1991) (potential\nfor prejudice mitigated by the size of the \u201cmetropolitan\nWashington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a popula\u00ad\ntion of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hun\u00ad\ndreds of murders are committed each year\u201d); Gentile v.\nState Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1044 (1991) (plurality\nopinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was\ndrawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Skilling\u2019s reliance on Estes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced;\n\nthose cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings\nduring trial. See supra, at 14. Skilling does not assert that news\ncoverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.\n  15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with\n\nhis first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named\nhim when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not\nkind, they contained no confession or other blatantly\nprejudicial information of the type readers or viewers\ncould not reasonably be expected to shut from sight.\nRideau\u2019s dramatically staged admission of guilt, for in\u00ad\nstance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of any\u00ad\none who watched it. Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62,\n72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s own con\u00ad\nfession [is] probably the most probative and damaging\nevidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skill\u00ad\ning was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of\nthe smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpa\u00ad\nbility. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F. 2d 241, 251\u2013\n252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (\u201cA jury may have difficulty in\ndisbelieving or forgetting a defendant\u2019s opinion of his own\nguilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of\nothers because they may not be well-founded.\u201d).\n  Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a\nwidely reported crime, e.g., Rideau, 373 U. S., at 724, over\nfour years elapsed between Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related\nnews throughout this period, the decibel level of media\nattention diminished somewhat in the years following\nEnron\u2019s collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467\nU. S., at 1032, 1034.\n  Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling\u2019s jury acquit\u00ad\nted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier\ninstituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no over\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nApp. 375a\u2013376a. In response to the follow-up question \u201c[w]hat words \n\ncome to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?\u201d, two-thirds of\n\nrespondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43%\n\neither had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind\n\nwhen they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling\u2019s name was\n\nassociated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210\u2013\n\n3211; see App. 417a\u2013492a. \n\n18                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhelming victory for the Government.16 In Rideau, Estes,\nand Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury\u2019s verdict did\nnot undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias. It\nwould be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice\nin a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run counter to that pre\u00ad\nsumption. See, e.g., United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867\nF. 2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (\u201cThe jury\u2019s ability to discern\na failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes\nindicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and\nreinforces our belief and conclusion that the media cover\u00ad\nage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an\nimpartial trial.\u201d).\n                               4\n   Skilling\u2019s trial, in short, shares little in common with\nthose in which we approved a presumption of juror preju\u00ad\ndice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion\nbased primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of\nmedia attention directed at Enron. But \u201cpretrial public\u00ad\nity\u2014even pervasive, adverse publicity\u2014does not inevita\u00ad\nbly lead to an unfair trial.\u201d Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stu\nart, 427 U. S. 539, 554 (1976). In this case, as just noted,\nnews stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid,\nunforgettable information we have recognized as particu\u00ad\nlarly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston\u2019s size and\ndiversity diluted the media\u2019s impact.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 As  the United States summarizes, \u201c[i]n Hirko, the jury deliberated\nfor several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly,\nwhich was routinely described as \u2018the first Enron criminal trial,\u2019 the\njury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron execu\u00ad\ntive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of\nslightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that\nthe true loss . . . was $40 million.\u201d Brief for United States 9\u201310 (cita\u00ad\ntion omitted).\n   17 The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention\n\naimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron\u2019s downfall more generally.\nData submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor did Enron\u2019s \u201csheer number of victims,\u201d 554 F. 3d, at\n560, trigger a presumption of prejudice. Although the\nwidespread community impact necessitated careful identi\u00ad\nfication and inspection of prospective jurors\u2019 connections to\nEnron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow\u00ad\nup voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight\nshows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra,\nat 24, jurors\u2019 links to Enron were either nonexistent or\nattenuated.\n   Finally, although Causey\u2019s \u201cwell-publicized decision to\nplead guilty\u201d shortly before trial created a danger of juror\nprejudice, 554 F. 3d, at 559, the District Court took appro\u00ad\npriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the\nproceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that\ndevelopment. And during voir dire, the court asked about\nprospective jurors\u2019 exposure to recent publicity, including\nnews regarding Causey. Only two venire members re\u00ad\ncalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and\nneither ultimately served on Skilling\u2019s jury. App. 888a,\n993a. Although publicity about a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea\ncalls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does\nnot ordinarily\u2014and, we are satisfied, it did not here\u2014\nwarrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.\n   Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 we conclude\nthat the District Court, in declining to order a venue\nchange, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntransfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories\nspecifically named him. App. 572a. \u201c[W]hen publicity is about the\nevent, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen\nany prejudicial impact.\u201d United States v. Hueftle, 687 F. 2d 1305, 1310\n(CA10 1982).\n  18 The parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can\n\nbe rebutted, and, if it can, what standard of proof governs that issue.\nCompare Brief for Petitioner 25\u201335 with Brief for United States 24\u201332,\n35\u201336. Because we hold that no presumption arose, we need not, and\ndo not, reach these questions.\n  19 The dissent acknowledges that \u201cthe prospect of seating an unbiased\n20                 SKILLING v.

Voir dire, Skilling asserts, did not ade\u00ad\nquately detect and defuse juror bias. \u201c[T]he record . . .\naffirmatively confirm[s]\u201d prejudice, he maintains, because\nseveral seated jurors \u201cprejudged his guilt.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 21.

See United States v. Wood, 299\nU. S. 123, 145\u2013146 (1936) (\u201cImpartiality is not a technical\nconception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of\nthis mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Con\u00ad\nstitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is\nnot chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d). Jury\nselection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is \u201cparticularly\nwithin the province of the trial judge.\u201d Ristaino v. Ross,\n424 U.

The dissent\u2019s conclusion that Skilling did\nnot receive a fair trial accordingly turns on its perception of the ade\u00ad\nquacy of the jury-selection process.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

See Reynolds, 98 U. S., at 156\u2013157. In contrast to\nthe cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in\u00ad\nthe-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more inti\u00ad\nmate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s\nfitness for jury service. We consider the adequacy of jury\nselection in Skilling\u2019s case, therefore, attentive to the\nrespect due to district-court determinations of juror im\u00ad\npartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that\nimpartiality.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 The  dissent recognizes \u201cthe \u2018wide discretion\u2019 owed to trial courts\nwhen it comes to jury-related issues,\u201d post, at 22 (quoting Mu\u2019Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U. S. 415, 427 (1991)), but its analysis of the District\nCourt\u2019s voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness. For\nexample, the dissent faults the District Court for not questioning\nprospective jurors regarding their \u201cknowledge of or feelings about\u201d\nCausey\u2019s guilty plea. Post, at 28. But the court could reasonably\ndecline to ask direct questions involving Causey\u2019s plea to avoid tipping\noff until-that-moment uninformed venire members that the plea had\noccurred. Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to\nfind a way to question venire members about Causey \u201cwithout mention\u00ad\ning anything\u201d). Nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about\nvenire members\u2019 knowledge of the plea; indeed, counsel posed such a\nquestion, id., at 993a; cf. post, at 28, n. 14 (acknowledging that counsel\n\u201csqueeze[d] in\u201d an inquiry whether a venire member had \u201cread about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). From this Court\u2019s lofty and \u201cpanoramic\u201d\nvantage point, post, at 22, lines of voir dire inquiry that \u201cmight be\nhelpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial\u201d are not hard to\nconceive. Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 425. \u201cTo be constitutionally compelled,\nhowever, it is not enough that such questions might be helpful. Rather,\n22                 SKILLING v.

Our review of the record, however,\nyields a different appraisal.21\n   As noted, supra, at 4\u20136, and n. 4, the District Court\ninitially screened venire members by eliciting their re\u00ad\nsponses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large\npart by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospec\u00ad\ntive jurors excusable for cause and served as a spring\u00ad\nboard for further questions put to remaining members of\nthe array. Voir dire thus was, in the court\u2019s words, the\n\u201cculmination of a lengthy process.\u201d App. 841a; see 554\nF. 3d, at 562, n. 51 (\u201cWe consider the . . . questionnaire in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to ask these questions must render the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d Id., at 425\u2013426. According appro\u00ad\npriate deference to the District Court, we cannot characterize jury\u00ad\nselection in this case as fundamentally unfair. Cf. supra, at 8, n. 6\n(same selection process was used in other Enron-related prosecutions).\n  21 In addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire, our decisions\n\nhave also \u201ctake[n] into account . . . other measures [that] were used to\nmitigate the adverse effects of publicity.\u201d Nebraska Press Assn. v.\nStuart, 427 U. S. 539, 565 (1976). We have noted, for example, the\nprophylactic effect of \u201cemphatic and clear instructions on the sworn\nduty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in\nopen court.\u201d Id., at 564. Here, the District Court\u2019s instructions were\nunequivocal; the jurors, the court emphasized, were duty bound \u201cto\nreach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the\nevidence [they] hear[d] and read in th[e] courtroom.\u201d App. 1026a.\nPeremptory challenges, too, \u201cprovid[e] protection against [prejudice],\u201d\nUnited States ex rel.

See\nsupra, at 8, n. 6.23\n   The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware\nof the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity,\nto ensure against jury bias. At Skilling\u2019s urging, the court\nexamined each prospective juror individually, thus pre\u00ad\nventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other\nvenire members. See Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 425. To en\u00ad\ncourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that\nthere were \u201cno right and wrong answers to th[e] ques\u00ad\ntions.\u201d E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling\u2019s re\u00ad\nquest for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience,\npotential jurors were \u201cmore forthcoming\u201d when the court,\nrather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805.\nThe parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask\nfollow-up questions of every prospective juror brought to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   22 The dissent\u2019s analysis undervalues the 77-item questionnaire, a\n\npart of the selection process difficult to portray as \u201ccursory,\u201d post, at 30,\nor \u201canemic,\u201d post, at 35. Notably, the \u201copen-ended questions about\n[prospective jurors\u2019] impressions of Enron or Skilling\u201d that the dissent\ncontends should have been asked, post, at 30, were asked\u2014on the\nquestionnaire, see supra, at 5\u20136, n. 4. Moreover, the District Court\ngave Skilling\u2019s counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about\ntheir responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g., App. 869a\u2013870a; id., at\n878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus follow-up opportunity to\ninterrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling\u2019s counsel \u201cclear ave\u00ad\nnue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.\u201d But see post, at 31, n. 17. See also\nApp. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (\u201cJudge, for the record, if I don\u2019t ask\nany questions, it\u2019s because the Court and other counsel have covered\nit.\u201d).\n   23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the \u201cBig Five\u201d public ac\u00ad\n\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen. See supra, at 8, n. 6. Among media\nreaders and auditors, the name and reputation of Arthur Andersen\nlikely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of\nJeffrey Skilling.

Skilling\u2019s counsel declined to ask\nanything of more than half of the venire members ques\u00ad\ntioned individually, including eight eventually selected for\nthe jury, because, he explained, \u201cthe Court and other\ncounsel have covered\u201d everything he wanted to know.\nApp. 967a.\n   Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the\nindividuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,\nnotwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection\nprocess successfully secured jurors who were largely un\u00ad\ntouched by Enron\u2019s collapse.24 Eleven of the seated jurors\nand alternates reported no connection at all to Enron,\nwhile all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial\nlink. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (\u201cI once met a\nguy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his\nname.\u201d).25 As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alter\u00ad\nnates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention\nto Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a\u2013860a (Juror\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury,\n\nthe dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that\njury. See, e.g., post, at 6, n. 4 (quoting the questionnaires of ten venire\nmembers; all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced, see\nRecord 11891); post, at 7, n. 6 (quoting the questionnaires of 15 venire\nmembers; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury); post, at 10\u201311, n. 7 (quoting voir\ndire testimony of six venire members; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury); post,\nat 28\u201334 (reporting at length voir dire testimony of Venire Members 17,\n29, 61, 74, 75, and 101; none sat on Skilling\u2019s jury). Statements by\nnonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury\u00ad\nselection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one\nindicator that the process fulfilled its function. Critically, as discussed\ninfra, at 24\u201326, the seated jurors showed little knowledge of or interest\nin, and were personally unaffected by, Enron\u2019s downfall.\n  25 See also Supp. App. 11sa (Juror 10) (\u201cknew some casual co-workers\n\nthat owned Enron stock\u201d); id., at 26sa (Juror 11) (\u201cwork[s] with some\u00ad\none who worked at Enron\u201d); id., at 117sa; App. 940a (Juror 64) (two\nacquaintances lost money due to Enron\u2019s collapse); Supp. App. 236sa\n(Juror 116) (work colleague lost money as a result of Enron\u2019s\nbankruptcy).\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

They reported [Irvin\u2019s] offer to plead\n    guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the de\u00ad\n    termination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to\n    secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had con\u00ad\n    fessed to 24 burglaries (the modus operandi of these\n    robberies was compared to that of the murders and\n    the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed\n    the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing\n    [Irvin\u2019s] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin]\n    as remorseless and without conscience but also as\n    having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of\n    doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described\n    as the \u2018confessed slayer of six,\u2019 a parole violator and\n    fraudulent-check artist.       [Irvin\u2019s] court-appointed\n    counsel was quoted as having received \u2018much criticism\n    over being Irvin\u2019s counsel\u2019 and it was pointed out, by\n28               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject\n     to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On\n     the day before the trial the newspapers carried the\n     story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of\n     [one victim] as well as \u2018the robbery-murder of [a sec\u00ad\n     ond individual]; the murder of [a third individual],\n     and the slaughter of three members of [a different\n     family].\u2019 \u201d Id., at 725\u2013726.\n\u201c[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were\ndelivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in\u201d the county\nwhere the trial occurred, which had a population of only\n30,000; \u201cradio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed\nthat county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the\nsame incidents.\u201d Id., at 725.\n  Reviewing Irvin\u2019s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that\n\u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice\u201d in the commu\u00ad\nnity \u201cwas clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir\ndire\u201d: \u201c370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those exam\u00ad\nined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,\u201d\nand \u201c[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.\u201d\nId., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although\nthese jurors declared they could be impartial, we held\nthat, \u201c[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much\nthat [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so\nhuge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one\nin which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing\nany testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.\u201d Id., at\n728.\n  In this case, as noted, supra, at 17, news stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor\u00ad\nmation rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies\nand murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in\ncommon with the rural community in which Irvin\u2019s trial\nproceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media\nsources were far lower than the 95% saturation level\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling\u2019s seated jurors, moreover, exhib\u00ad\nited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin. See\nsupra, at 24\u201326 (noting, inter alia, that none of Skilling\u2019s\njurors answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they \u201cha[d] an opinion\nabout . . . Skilling\u201d).

In\nlight of these large differences, the District Court had far\nless reason than did the trial court in Irvin to discredit\njurors\u2019 promises of fairness.\n   The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire\nmembers who proclaimed their impartiality at their\nword.30 As noted, all of Skilling\u2019s jurors had already af\u00ad\nfirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no\ntrouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.\nNevertheless, the court followed up with each individually\nto uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to\ngauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information\nfrom the questionnaires regarding jurors\u2019 backgrounds,\nopinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy\nfoundation to assess fitness for jury service. See 554 F. 3d,\nat 562 (The District Court made \u201cthorough\u201d credibility\ndeterminations that \u201crequir[ed] more than just the [venire\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 The court viewed with skepticism, for example, Venire Member\n\n104\u2019s promises that she could \u201cabide by law,\u201d follow the court\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntions, and find Skilling not guilty if the Government did not prove its\ncase, App. 1004a; \u201cI have to gauge . . . demeanor, all the answers she\ngave me,\u201d the court stated, and \u201c[s]he persuaded me that she could not\nbe fair and impartial, so she\u2019s excused,\u201d id., at 1006a.\n30                  SKILLING v.

Skill\u00ad\ning, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell short\nof constitutional requirements.31\n                                3\n    Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and\ncontends they were openly biased. See United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304, 316 (2000) (\u201c[T]he seat\u00ad\ning of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause\n. . . require[s] reversal.\u201d).

S., at 428\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover,\nunsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for\ncause, \u201cstrong evidence that he was convinced the [other]\njurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as\nto his guilt.\u201d Beck v. Washington, 369 U. S. 541, 557\u2013558\n(1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to\nSkilling\u2019s specific allegations of juror partiality.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  31 Skillingemphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who\nsuffered from Enron\u2019s collapse because the District Court failed to grant\nhis for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund\nlost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron\nstock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on\nSkilling\u2019s jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory chal\u00ad\nlenge. \u201c[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge\u2019s erroneous for\u00ad\ncause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently\nconvicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,\u201d we have held, \u201che has\nnot been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.\u201d United States v.\nMartinez-Salazar, 528 U.

Indeed, the \u201cuse [of] a\nperemptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error\u201d\nexemplifies \u201ca principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the\nconstitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Id., at 316.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

In response to follow-up questions from\nSkilling\u2019s counsel, she again stated she would not presume\nthat Skilling violated any laws and could \u201c[a]bsolutely\u201d\ngive her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a\u2013938a.\n\u201cJurors,\u201d we have recognized, \u201ccannot be expected invaria\u00ad\nbly to express themselves carefully or even consistently.\u201d\nYount, 467 U. S., at 1039.

From where\nwe sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.\n   The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have\nexcluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign\nof prejudice we can discern.

Skilling\u2019s counsel\ndeclined to ask follow-up questions of any of these jurors\nand, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because\nshe \u201cgave all the right answers.\u201d Id., at 972a. Whatever\nSkilling\u2019s reasons for wanting to strike these four indi\u00ad\nviduals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they dis\u00ad\nplayed a disqualifying bias.33\n   In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption\nof prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that\ntried him. Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended,\nneed not enter the box with empty heads in order to de\u00ad\ntermine the facts impartially. \u201cIt is sufficient if the ju\u00ad\nror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d\nIrvin, 366 U. S., at 723. Taking account of the full record,\nrather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from\nit, we find no cause to upset the lower courts\u2019 judgment\nthat Skilling\u2019s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling that Skilling received a fair\ntrial.34\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 Although  Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at\ntrial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for\nPetitioner 14\u201315; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas,\nthe voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that\nthey were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a\u2013853a (Juror 10) (did not\nprejudge Skilling\u2019s guilt, indicated he could follow the court\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair\nto Skilling, and said he would \u201cjudge on the facts\u201d); id., at 974a (Juror\n87) (had \u201cnot formed an opinion\u201d on whether Skilling was guilty and\naffirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).\n   34 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror\n34                  SKILLING v.

The honest-services statute, \u00a71346,\nSkilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alterna\u00ad\ntively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within\nthe statute\u2019s compass.\n                              A\n  To place Skilling\u2019s constitutional challenge in context,\nwe first review the origin and subsequent application of\nthe honest-services doctrine.\n                             1\n   Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the\npredecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws,\nproscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to\nadvance \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud.\u201d See McNally\nv. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 356 (1987). In 1909, Con\u00ad\ngress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today,\n\u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money\nor property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises.\u201d \u00a71341 (emphasis added); see\nid., at 357\u2013358. Emphasizing Congress\u2019 disjunctive phras\u00ad\ning, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted\nthe term \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d to include depri\u00ad\nvations not only of money or property, but also of intangi\u00ad\nble rights.\n   In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S. 415;\nPatton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S.\n794 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest\nconveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a\npremise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions\nwhen they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence\npresented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and\nthe District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

United States, 117 F. 2d 110\n(1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecu\u00ad\ntion of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from\nentrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial\nto the bribe payers. \u201cIt is not true that because the [city]\nwas to make and did make a saving by the operations\nthere could not have been an intent to defraud,\u201d the Court\nof Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. \u201cA scheme to get a\npublic contract on more favorable terms than would likely\nbe got otherwise by bribing a public official,\u201d the court\nobserved, \u201cwould not only be a plan to commit the crime of\nbribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.\u201d\nId., at 115.\n   The Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Shushan stimulated the\ndevelopment of an \u201chonest-services\u201d doctrine. Unlike\nfraud in which the victim\u2019s loss of money or property\nsupplied the defendant\u2019s gain, with one the mirror image\nof the other, see, e.g., United States v. Starr, 816 F. 2d 94,\n101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted cor\u00ad\nruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender\nprofited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of\nmoney or property; instead, a third party, who had not\nbeen deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a\ncity mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third\nparty in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,\nyet the contract terms were the same as any that could\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length, the city (the be\u00ad\ntrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally,\n483 U. S., at 360. Even if the scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned,\nactionable harm lay in the denial of that party\u2019s right to\nthe offender\u2019s \u201chonest services.\u201d See, e.g., United States v.\nDixon, 536 F. 2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).\n   \u201cMost often these cases . . . involved bribery of public\nofficials,\u201d United States v.

Crim. L. Rev.\n423, 456 (1983).35\n                                    2\n  In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States,\nstopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine\nin its tracks. McNally involved a state officer who, in\nselecting Kentucky\u2019s insurance agent, arranged to procure\na share of the agent\u2019s commissions via kickbacks paid to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  35 In addition to upholding honest-services prosecutions, courts also\n\nincreasingly approved use of the mail-fraud statute to attack corruption\nthat deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights, including\nelection fraud and privacy violations. See, e.g., Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 18, n. 2 (2000); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.\n350, 362\u2013364, and nn. 1\u20134 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The prosecutor did not charge that, \u201cin the absence of\nthe alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid\na lower premium or secured better insurance.\u201d Ibid. In\u00ad\nstead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback\nscheme \u201cdefraud[ed] the citizens and government of Ken\u00ad\ntucky of their right to have the Commonwealth\u2019s affairs\nconducted honestly.\u201d Id., at 353.\n  We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.\n\u201cRather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that\nleaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the\nFederal Government in setting standards of disclosure and\ngood government for local and state officials,\u201d we read the\nstatute \u201cas limited in scope to the protection of property\nrights.\u201d Id., at 360. \u201cIf Congress desires to go further,\u201d we\nstated, \u201cit must speak more clearly.\u201d Ibid.\n                              3\n   Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it\nenacted a new statute \u201cspecifically to cover one of the\n\u2018intangible rights\u2019 that lower courts had protected . . . prior\nto McNally: \u2018the intangible right of honest services.\u2019 \u201d\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 19\u201320 (2000). In\nfull, the honest-services statute stated:\n    \u201cFor the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United\n    States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud,\n    \u00a71341, and wire fraud, \u00a71343], the term \u2018scheme or\n    artifice to defraud\u2019 includes a scheme or artifice to\n    deprive another of the intangible right of honest ser\u00ad\n    vices.\u201d \u00a71346.\n                             B\n  Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not\nclearly: He asserts that \u00a71346 is unconstitutionally vague.\nTo satisfy due process, \u201ca penal statute [must] define the\ncriminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordi\u00ad\n38                 SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\u201d Kolender v. Lawson, 461\nU. S. 352, 357 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine\nembraces these requirements.\n  According to Skilling, \u00a71346 meets neither of the two\ndue process essentials. First, the phrase \u201cthe intangible\nright of honest services,\u201d he contends, does not adequately\ndefine what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38\u201339.\nSecond, he alleges, \u00a71346\u2019s \u201cstandardless sweep allows\npolicemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal\npredilections,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat[ing] opportunistic and\narbitrary prosecutions.\u201d Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461\nU. S., at 358).\n  In urging invalidation of \u00a71346, Skilling swims against\nour case law\u2019s current, which requires us, if we can, to\nconstrue, not condemn, Congress\u2019 enactments. See, e.g.,\nCivil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571\n(1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products\nCorp., 372 U. S. 29, 32 (1963) (stressing, in response to a\nvagueness challenge, \u201c[t]he strong presumptive validity\nthat attaches to an Act of Congress\u201d). Alert to \u00a71346\u2019s\npotential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on\nhow best to interpret the statute.36 Uniformly, however,\nthey have declined to throw out the statute as irremedia\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  36 Courts have disagreed about whether \u00a71346 prosecutions must be\n\nbased on a violation of state law, compare, e.g., United States v. Brum\nley, 116 F. 3d 728, 734\u2013735 (CA5 1997) (en banc), with, e.g., United\nStates v. Weyhrauch, 548 F. 3d 1237, 1245\u20131246 (CA9 2008), vacated\nand remanded, post, p. ___; whether a defendant must contemplate that\nthe victim suffer economic harm, compare, e.g., United States v. Sun-\nDiamond Growers of Cal., 138 F. 3d 961, 973 (CADC 1998), with, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Black, 530 F. 3d 596, 600\u2013602 (CA7 2008), vacated and\nremanded, post, p. ___; and whether the defendant must act in pursuit\nof private gain, compare, e.g., United States v. Bloom, 149 F. 3d 649,\n655 (CA7 1998), with, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F. 3d 678,\n692 (CA3 2002).\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   39\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbly vague.37\n   We agree that \u00a71346 should be construed rather than\ninvalidated. First, we look to the doctrine developed in\npre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the mean\u00ad\ning of the phrase \u201cthe intangible right of honest services.\u201d\nSecond, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the\nstatute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to\nits core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved\nfraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services\nthrough bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who\nhad not been deceived. Confined to these paramount\napplications, \u00a71346 presents no vagueness problem.\n                               1\n  There is no doubt that Congress intended \u00a71346 to refer\nto and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized\nin Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions before McNally derailed the\nintangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner\n39; Brief for United States 37\u201338; post, at 2, 8 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress\nenacted \u00a71346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the\nstatute using that decision\u2019s terminology. See 483 U. S.,\nat 355 (\u201cintangible righ[t]\u201d); id., at 362 (STEVENS, J., dis\u00ad\nsenting) (\u201cright to . . . honest services\u201d).38 As the Second\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  37 See, e.g., United States v.

Bryan, 58 F. 3d 933, 941 (CA4 1995).\n  38 Although verbal formulations varied slightly, the words employed\n\nby the Courts of Appeals prior to McNally described the same concept:\n\u201chonest services,\u201d e.g., United States v. Bruno, 809 F. 2d 1097, 1105\n(CA5 1987); \u201chonest and faithful services,\u201d e.g., United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit observed in its leading analysis of \u00a71346:\n     \u201cThe definite article \u2018the\u2019 suggests that \u2018intangible\n     right of honest services\u2019 had a specific meaning to\n     Congress when it enacted the statute\u2014Congress was\n     recriminalizing mail- and wire-fraud schemes to de\u00ad\n     prive others of that \u2018intangible right of honest ser\u00ad\n     vices,\u2019 which had been protected before McNally, not\n     all intangible rights of honest services whatever they\n     might be thought to be.\u201d United States v. Rybicki, 354\n     F. 3d 124, 137\u2013138 (2003) (en banc).39\n                               2\n  Satisfied that Congress, by enacting \u00a71346, \u201cmeant to\nreinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law,\u201d\npost, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), we have surveyed that\ncase law. See infra, at 42\u201344, 46. In parsing the Courts of\nAppeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling\u2019s vague\u00ad\nness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions\npreceding McNally were not models of clarity or consis\u00ad\ntency. See Brief for Petitioner 39\u201342 (describing divisions\nof opinions). See also post, at 3\u20137 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nWhile the honest-services cases preceding McNally domi\u00ad\nnantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to brib\u00ad\nery and kickback schemes\u2014schemes that were the basis of\nmost honest-services prosecutions\u2014there was consider\u00ad\nable disarray over the statute\u2019s application to conduct\noutside that core category.

Moreover, \u201c[a]lthough not as\nnumerous as the bribery and kickback cases,\u201d the Gov\u00ad\nernment asserts, \u201cthe pre-McNally cases involving undis\u00ad\nclosed self-dealing were abundant.\u201d Ibid.\n   Neither of these contentions withstands close inspec\u00ad\ntion. McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 36\u2013\n37, 43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public offi\u00ad\ncial, in exchange for routing Kentucky\u2019s insurance busi\u00ad\nness through a middleman company, arranged for that\ncompany to share its commissions with entities in which\nthe official held an interest. 483 U. S., at 352\u2013353, 360.\nThis was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest;\nrather, the official conspired with a third party so that\nboth would profit from wealth generated by public con\u00ad\ntracts. See id., at 352\u2013353. Reading \u00a71346 to proscribe\nbribes and kickbacks\u2014and nothing more\u2014satisfies Con\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlion\u2019s share of honest-services cases, limiting \u00a71346 to these heartland\napplications is surely \u201cfairly possible.\u201d Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,\n331 (1988); cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380 (2005) (opinion of\nthe Court by SCALIA, J.) (when adopting a limiting construction, \u201c[t]he\nlowest common denominator, as it were, must govern\u201d). So construed,\nthe statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 47\u201348; post, at\n8. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged\nthrough a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step\nwith precedent.\n46              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019 undoubted aim to reverse McNally on its facts.\n   Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of\u00ad\ninterest cases constitute core applications of the honest\u00ad\nservices doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld\nhonest-services convictions for \u201csome schemes of non\u00ad\ndisclosure and concealment of material information,\u201d\nMandel, 591 F. 2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on\nwhich schemes qualified. In light of the relative infre\u00ad\nquency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to\nbribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit incon\u00ad\nsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable\nlimiting construction of \u00a71346 must exclude this amor\u00ad\nphous category of cases.\n   Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar\nprinciple that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal\nstatutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Cleveland,\n531 U. S., at 25 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.

E.g., United States v. Universal C. I. T.\nCredit Corp., 344 U.

Recall\nthat the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns\nabout (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory\nprosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. A prohibi\u00ad\ntion on fraudulently depriving another of one\u2019s honest\nservices by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present\na problem on either score.\n   As to fair notice, \u201cwhatever the school of thought con\u00ad\ncerning the scope and meaning of \u201d \u00a71346, it has always\nbeen \u201cas plain as a pikestaff that\u201d bribes and kickbacks\nconstitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951), and the statute\u2019s mens rea\nrequirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g.,\nScrews v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 101\u2013104 (1945)\n(plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU.

The\nGovernment proposes a standard that prohibits the \u201ctaking of official\naction by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial\ninterests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he\nowes a fiduciary duty,\u201d so long as the employee acts with a specific\nintent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim\nto change its behavior. Id., at 43\u201344. See also id., at 40\u201341. That\nformulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct\nor significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To\nwhat extent does the official action have to further that interest in\norder to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and\nwhat information should it convey? These questions and others call for\nparticular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohi\u00ad\nbition in this context.\n48                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little\nrelevance . . . where appellants\u2019 conduct falls squarely\nwithin the \u2018hard core\u2019 of the statute\u2019s proscriptions.\u201d).\nToday\u2019s decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls\nwithin \u00a71346\u2019s province. See United States v. Lanier, 520\nU. S. 259, 266 (1997) (\u201c[C]larity at the requisite level may\nbe supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain\nstatute.\u201d).\n   As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant\nrisk that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it\ntoday, will be stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on\nbribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-\nMcNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscrib\u00ad\ning\u2014and defining\u2014similar crimes. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7201(b), 666(a)(2); 41 U. S. C. \u00a752(2) (\u201cThe term \u2018kick\u00ad\nback\u2019 means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift,\ngratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind\nwhich is provided, directly or indirectly, to [enumerated\npersons] for the purpose of improperly obtaining or re\u00ad\nwarding favorable treatment in connection with [enumer\u00ad\nated circumstances].\u201d).45 See also, e.g., United States v.\nGanim, 510 F. 3d 134, 147\u2013149 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.)\n(reviewing honest-services conviction involving bribery in\nlight of elements of bribery under other federal statutes);\nUnited States v.

A criminal defendant who participated in\na bribery or kickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably\ncomplain about prosecution under \u00a71346 on vagueness\ngrounds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  45 Overlap with other federal statutes does not render \u00a71346 superflu\u00ad\n\nous. The principal federal bribery statute, \u00a7201, for example, generally\napplies only to federal public officials, so \u00a71346\u2019s application to state\nand local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct\nthat might otherwise go unpunished.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Skilling\u2019s honest-services prosecution, the\nGovernment concedes, was not \u201cprototypical.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 49. The Government charged Skilling with\nconspiring to defraud Enron\u2019s shareholders by misrepre\u00ad\nsenting the company\u2019s fiscal health, thereby artificially\ninflating its stock price. It was the Government\u2019s theory\nat trial that Skilling \u201cprofited from the fraudulent scheme\n. . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and\nthrough the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron\nstock, which netted him $89 million.\u201d Id., at 51.\n    The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skill\u00ad\ning solicited or accepted side payments from a third party\nin exchange for making these misrepresentations. See\nRecord 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government\nto the District Court) (\u201c[T]he indictment does not allege,\nand the government\u2019s evidence did not show, that [Skill\u00ad\ning] engaged in bribery.\u201d). It is therefore clear that, as we\nread \u00a71346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.\n    Because the indictment alleged three objects of the con-\nspiracy\u2014honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property\nwire fraud, and securities fraud\u2014Skilling\u2019s conviction\nis flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298\n(1957) (constitutional error occurs when a jury is in\u00ad\nstructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a\ngeneral verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory).\nThis determination, however, does not necessarily require\nreversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently con\u00ad\nfirmed, in Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008) (per\ncuriam), that errors of the Yates variety are subject to\nharmless-error analysis. The parties vigorously dispute\nwhether the error was harmless. Compare Brief for\nUnited States 52 (\u201c[A]ny juror who voted for conviction\nbased on [the honest-services theory] also would have\nfound [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities\n50                  SKILLING v.

We leave this dispute for\nresolution on remand.46\n   Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count\ntouches any of Skilling\u2019s other convictions is also an open\nquestion. All of his convictions, Skilling contends, hinged\non the conspiracy count and, like dominoes, must fall if it\nfalls. The District Court, deciding Skilling\u2019s motion for\nbail pending appeal, found this argument dubious, App.\n1141a\u20131142a, but the Fifth Circuit had no occasion to rule\non it. That court may do so on remand.\n                        *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\nruling on Skilling\u2019s fair-trial argument, vacate its ruling\non his conspiracy conviction, and remand the case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                       It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  46 The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, \u201cif\n\nany of the three objects of Skilling\u2019s conspiracy offers a legally insuffi\u00ad\ncient theory,\u201d it \u201cmust set aside his conviction.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 543.

I therefore join Parts\nI and II of the Court\u2019s opinion. I also agree that the deci\u00ad\nsion upholding Skilling\u2019s conviction for so-called \u201chonest\u00ad\nservices fraud\u201d must be reversed, but for a different rea\u00ad\nson. In my view, the specification in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71346\n(2006 ed., Supp. II) that \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d in\nthe mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343\n(2006 ed.), includes \u201ca scheme or artifice to deprive an\u00ad\nother of the intangible right of honest services,\u201d is vague,\nand therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility\nin proclaiming that our task is \u201cnot to destroy the Act . . .\nbut to construe it,\u201d ante, at 42 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in transforming the prohibition of \u201chonest\u00ad\nservices fraud\u201d into a prohibition of \u201cbribery and kick\u00ad\nbacks\u201d it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the\npower to define new federal crimes. See United States v.\nHudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\n2                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it\nproscribes, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague\ncannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see Lan\nzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939), nor by\njudicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its\ntext does not contain, see United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.\n214, 219\u2013221 (1876). Our cases have described vague\nstatutes as failing \u201cto provide a person of ordinary intelli\u00ad\ngence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so\nstandardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seri\u00ad\nously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d United States v. Wil\nliams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). Here, Skilling argues\nthat \u00a71346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages\narbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of\nthe right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.\nBrief for Petitioner 38\u201339, 42\u201344. In my view Skilling is\ncorrect.\n   The Court maintains that \u201cthe intangible right of honest\nservices \u201d means the right not to have one\u2019s fiduciaries\naccept \u201cbribes or kickbacks.\u201d Its first step in reaching\nthat conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to\n\u201cthe doctrine developed\u201d in cases decided by lower federal\ncourts prior to our decision in McNally v. United States,\n483 U. S. 350 (1987). Ante, at 39. I do not contest that. I\nagree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the\nlower-court case law that had been disapproved by\nMcNally\u2014what the Court calls \u201cthe pre-McNally honest\u00ad\nservices doctrine,\u201d ante, at 42. The problem is that that\ndoctrine provides no \u201cascertainable standard of guilt,\u201d\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89\n(1921), and certainly is not limited to \u201cbribes or kick\u00ad\nbacks.\u201d\n   Investigation into the meaning of \u201cthe pre-McNally\nhonest-services doctrine\u201d might logically begin with\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

That case repudiated the\nmany Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the\nmeaning of \u201cfraud\u201d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud stat\u00ad\nutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483\nU. S., at 360. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibi\u00ad\ntion of \u201cbribery and kickbacks,\u201d one would have expected\nthose words to appear in the opinion\u2019s description of the\ncases. In fact, they do not. Not at all. Nor did McNally\neven provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing\ntheory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right\nof citizens \u201cto have the [State]\u2019s affairs conducted hon\u00ad\nestly,\u201d id., at 353, to \u201chonest and impartial government,\u201d\nid., at 355, to \u201cgood government,\u201d id., at 356, and \u201cto have\npublic officials perform their duties honestly,\u201d id., at 358.\nIt described prior case law as holding that \u201ca public official\nowes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office\nfor private gain is a fraud,\u201d id., at 355.\n   But the pre-McNally Court of Appeals opinions were not\nlimited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held\nthat those fiduciaries subject to the \u201chonest services\u201d\nobligation included private individuals who merely par\u00ad\nticipated in public decisions, see, e.g., United States v.\nGray, 790 F. 2d 1290, 1295\u20131296 (CA6 1986) (citing\nUnited States v. Margiotta, 688 F. 2d 108, 122 (CA2\n1982)), and even private employees who had no role in\npublic decisions, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720\nF. 2d 1327, 1335\u20131336 (CADC 1983); United States v. Von\nBarta, 635 F. 2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, \u201cto say\nthat a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it\ngives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations\ndoes he owe as a fiduciary?\u201d SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318\nU. S. 80, 85\u201386 (1943). None of the \u201chonest services\u201d\ncases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those\npertaining to private employees, defined the nature and\ncontent of the fiduciary duty central to the \u201cfraud\u201d offense.\n   There was not even universal agreement concerning the\n4                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nsource of the fiduciary obligation\u2014whether it must be\npositive state or federal law, see, e.g., United States v.\nRabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely gen\u00ad\neral principles, such as the \u201cobligations of loyalty and\nfidelity\u201d that inhere in the \u201cemployment relationship,\u201d\nLemire, supra, at 1336. The decision McNally reversed\nhad grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific)\ntrust law, see Gray, supra, at 1294, a corpus juris fes\u00ad\ntooned with various duties. See, e.g., Restatement (Sec\u00ad\nond) of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7169\u2013185 (1976). Another pre-McNally\ncase referred to the general law of agency, United States v.\nBallard, 663 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on\nother grounds by 680 F. 2d 352 (1982), which imposes\nduties quite different from those of a trustee.1 See Re\u00ad\nstatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7377\u2013398 (1957).\n   This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes\nthat the pre-McNally cases developed a federal, common\u00ad\nlaw fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly unde\u00ad\nfined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad\nlanguage. Blachly v. United States, 380 F. 2d 665 (CA5\n1967), loftily declared that \u201c[l]aw puts its imprimatur on\nthe accepted moral standards and condemns conduct\nwhich fails to match the \u2018reflection of moral uprightness,\nof fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the\ngeneral and business life of members of society.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n671 (quoting Gregory v. United States, 253 F. 2d 104, 109\n(CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any\nscheme \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d was also condemned by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        Court is untroubled by these divisions because \u201cthese debates\nwere rare in bribe and kickback cases,\u201d in which \u201c[t]he existence of a\nfiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually\nbeyond dispute,\u201d ante, at 43, n. 41. This misses the point. The Courts\nof Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a\nbribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not\nconsistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a\nfiduciary.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe statute, United States v. Bohonus, 628 F. 2d 1167,\n1171 (CA9 1980). See also United States v. Mandel, 591\nF. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is \u201ccontrary\nto public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of\nmoral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and\nright dealing\u201d). Even opinions that did not indulge in such\ngrandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond\nloyalty or honesty, see, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1005\u2013\n1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be\ngreater for public officials than for private employees, see,\ne.g., Lemire, supra, at 1337, n. 13; Ballard, supra, at 541,\nn. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never\nmade clear.\n   The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many\ncourts held that some je-ne-sais-quoi beyond a mere\nbreach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest\u00ad\nservices fraud. See, e.g., Von Barta, supra, at 1006 (col\u00ad\nlecting cases); United States v. George, 477 F. 2d 508, 512\n(CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute\nabout that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing\nduties to the public. See United States v. Price, 788 F. 2d\n234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that\ndid require something additional where a public official\nwas involved, there was disagreement as to what the\naddition should be. For example, in United States v. Bush,\n522 F. 2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that mate\u00ad\nrial misrepresentations and active concealment were\nenough, id., at 647\u2013648. But in Rabbitt, 583 F. 2d 1014,\nthe Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was\nneeded, id., at 1026.\n   Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private\nemployees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must\nuse his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare\nLemire, supra, at 1335 (yes), with United States v. Bron\nston, 658 F. 2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion\nupheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the\n6                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and\nconsulting fees from [his employer\u2019s] suppliers resulted in\na breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of\nhis loyal and honest services.\u201d United States v. Bryza, 522\nF. 2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however,\ndemanded more than an intentional failure to disclose:\n\u201cThere must be a failure to disclose something which in\nthe knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an\nindependent business risk to the employer.\u201d Lemire, 720\nF. 2d, at 1337. Other courts required that the victim\nsuffer some loss, see, e.g., Ballard, supra, at 541\u2013542\u2014a\nproposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Newman, 664 F. 2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981);\nUnited States v. O\u2019Malley, 535 F. 2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).\nThe Court\u2019s statement today that there was a deprivation\nof honest services even if \u201cthe scheme occasioned a money\nor property gain for the betrayed party,\u201d ante, at 35, is\ntherefore true, except to the extent it is not.\n   In short, the first step in the Court\u2019s analysis\u2014holding\nthat \u201cthe intangible right of honest services\u201d refers to \u201cthe\nhonest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecisions before McNally,\u201d ante, at 39\u2014is a step out of the\nfrying pan into the fire. The pre-McNally cases provide no\nclear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of\nhonest services. The possibilities range from any action\nthat is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to\nonly the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his\nprincipal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator\u2019s position\nof trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The\nduty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but\nmaybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the\ncase of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time \u00a71346\nwas enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing\namong these options, for conclusively settling what was in\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

It knows that adopting\nby reference \u201cthe pre-McNally honest-services doctrine,\u201d\nante, at 42, is adopting by reference nothing more precise\nthan the referring term itself (\u201cthe intangible right of\nhonest services\u201d). Hence the deus ex machina: \u201c[W]e pare\nthat body of precedent down to its core,\u201d ante, at 39. Since\nthe honest-services doctrine \u201chad its genesis\u201d in bribery\nprosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for\nSkilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as \u201ccore\u201d\nor \u201cparadigm\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d examples, or \u201c[t]he most obvious\nform,\u201d of honest-services fraud, ante, at 43 (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel for\nthe Government say that they formed the \u201cvast majority,\u201d\nor \u201cmost\u201d or at least \u201c[t]he bulk\u201d of honest-services cases,\nante, at 42\u201344 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nTHEREFORE it must be the case that they are all\nCongress meant by its reference to the honest-services\ndoctrine.\n   Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it\nwould not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the stat\u00ad\nute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what\nacts constitute a breach of the \u201chonest services\u201d obligation\nunder the pre-McNally law. But it would not solve the\nmost fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the\n\u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d to which the bribery and kickback\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Courts since \u00a71346\u2019s enactment have fared no better, reproducing\n\nsome of the same disputes that predated McNally. See, e.g., Sorich v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3\u20134) (collecting cases). We have previ\u00ad\nously found important to our vagueness analysis \u201cthe conflicting results\nwhich have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges\nin seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.\u201d\nUnited States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921). I am at\na loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.\n8                      SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                             Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nrestriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials?\nOr in addition to private individuals who contract with the\npublic? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer\nhere? The pre-McNally case law does not provide an\nanswer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limita\u00ad\ntion the statute does not answer the question \u201cWhat is the\ncriterion of guilt?\u201d\n   But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvi\u00ad\nous that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was\nnot the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and\nkickbacks represented \u201cthe core\u201d of the doctrine, or that\nmost cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,\nis not to say that they are the doctrine. All it proves is\nthat the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with\nregard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much\nmore. Among all the pre-McNally sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord-offerings\nof varieties of honest-services fraud, not one is limited to\nbribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has\ncooked up all on its own.\n   Thus, the Court\u2019s claim to \u201crespec[t] the legislature,\u201d\nante, at 44, n. 43 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely\nclear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to\nreinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law; and\nentirely clear that that prohibited much more (though\nprecisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kick\u00ad\nbacks. Perhaps it is true that \u201cCongress intended \u00a71346 to\nreach at least bribes and kickbacks,\u201d ante, at 44. That\nsimply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that \u201c\u00a71346\ncriminalizes only\u201d bribery and kickbacks, ibid.\n   Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation\nbut invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal stan\u00ad\ndard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (in\u00ad\ncluded within the vague one) that can pass constitutional\nmuster. I know of no precedent for such \u201cparing down,\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The   only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is Civil Ser\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nand it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power. This is\nnot, as the Court claims, ante, at 41, simply a matter of\nadopting a \u201climiting construction\u201d in the face of potential\nunconstitutionality. To do that, our cases have been care\u00ad\nful to note, the narrowing construction must be \u201cfairly\npossible,\u201d Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988), \u201crea\u00ad\nsonable,\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895),\nor not \u201cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d Edward\nJ. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &\nConstr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). As we\nhave seen (and the Court does not contest), no court before\nMcNally concluded that the \u201cdeprivation of honest ser\u00ad\nvices\u201d meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If\nit were a \u201cfairly possible\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d construction, not\n\u201ccontrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d one would think that\nsome court would have adopted it. The Court does not\neven point to a post-McNally case that reads \u00a71346 to\ncover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the\nCourt so heavily relies, see ante, at 41\u201342, states that\n\u201cwhen the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvice Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). That case in\u00ad\nvolved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of\nthe Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a\nvagueness challenge\u2014not, however, by \u201cparing down\u201d the adjudications\nto a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what\nthey held was not vague. See id., at 571\u2013574. The string of cases the\nCourt lists, see ante, at 41, n. 40, (almost none of which addressed\nclaims of vagueness), have nothing to do with \u201cparing down.\u201d The one\nthat comes closest, United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S.\n363 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized\nby statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be\ncommenced and completed. That is not much different from \u201creading\nin\u201d a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in con\u00ad\ntracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or \u201cparing down\u201d of\nthe statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that\nthe proceedings would be prompt, id., at 370\u2013371, and noted that\n(unlike here) it was not \u201cdecid[ing] issues of policy,\u201d id., at 372.\n10               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nstatute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations,\nby one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the\nother valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction\nwhich will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.\u201d\nUnited States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909); see also United\nStates v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45 (1953) (describing the\ncanon as decisive \u201cin the choice of fair alternatives\u201d). Here\nthere is no choice to be made between two \u201cfair alterna\u00ad\ntives.\u201d Until today, no one has thought (and there is no\nbasis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohib\u00ad\nited only bribery and kickbacks.\n   I certainly agree with the Court that we must, \u201cif we\ncan,\u201d uphold, rather than \u201ccondemn,\u201d Congress\u2019s enact\u00ad\nments, ante, at 38. But I do not believe we have the\npower, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.\nCongress enacted the entirety of the pre-McNally honest\u00ad\nservices law, the content of which is (to put it mildly)\nunclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the\ntemptation to make all things right with the stroke of our\npen. See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974).\nI would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s conviction on the basis that \u00a71346 provides no \u201cascer\u00ad\ntainable standard\u201d for the conduct it condemns, L. Cohen,\n255 U. S., at 89. Instead, the Court today adds to our\nfunctions the prescription of criminal law.\n                              III\n   A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted\nsupra, at 2, Skilling has argued that \u00a71346 cannot be\nconstitutionally applied to him because it affords no defi\u00ad\nnition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though\nthis reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling\u2019s\nchallenge a \u201cfacial\u201d one, in the sense that it seeks invalida\u00ad\ntion of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to\npreventing its enforcement against him. I continue to\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See Chicago v.\nMorales, 527 U. S. 41, 77 (1999) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIn the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skill\u00ad\ning identifies in \u00a71346 may mean that if he wins, anyone\nelse prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see\nSmith, supra, at 576\u2013578. But Skilling only asks that his\nconviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57\u201358, so the\nremedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.\n  I would therefore reverse Skilling\u2019s conviction under\n\u00a71346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it\nprohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions\u2014\nobvious from my reasoning in the case\u2014would be a matter\nfor stare decisis.\n                        *    *     *\n  It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the\ndescription of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be\ndone, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness\nopinions, United States v. Reese, 92 U. S., at 221:\n       \u201cThe question, then, to be determined, is, whether\n    we can introduce words of limitation into a penal\n    statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it\n    is general only.\n         \u201cIt would certainly be dangerous if the legislature\n    could set a net large enough to catch all possible of\u00ad\n    fenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and\n    say who could be rightfully detained, and who should\n    be set at large.

Of course, evidence of pretrial media\nattention and widespread community hostility may play a\nrole in the bias inquiry. Such evidence may be important\nin assessing the adequacy of voir dire, see, e.g., Mu\u2019Min v.\nVirginia, 500 U.

There are occasions in which such evidence\nweighs heavily in favor of a change of venue.

Where there is extraordinary pretrial\npublicity and community hostility, he contends, a court\nmust presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of\nvenue. Brief for Petitioner 25\u201334. I disagree. Careful voir\ndire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even\nwhere pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile\ncommunity sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been\nselected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to\ninsulate jurors from media coverage during the course of\nthe trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is \u201can\nimpartial jury.\u201d If the jury that sits and returns a verdict\nis impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth\nAmendment requires.\n   The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text\nof the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It re\nquires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse\npretrial media coverage and community hostility in a\nparticular case has reached a certain level of severity, but\nthere is no clear way of demarcating that level or of de\ntermining whether it has been met.\n   Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960\u2019s\u2014\nSheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), Estes v. Texas,\n381 U. S. 532 (1965), and Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S.\n723 (1963). I do not read those cases as demanding peti\ntioner\u2019s suggested approach.          As the Court notes,\nSheppard and Estes primarily \u201cinvolved media interfer\nence with courtroom proceedings during trial.\u201d Ante, at\n16, n. 14; see also post, at 20 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part).

I respect\u00ad\nfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nJeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial\njury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the\npublic\u2019s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a\ncourt must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the\njury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The\nsudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of\npeople in the Houston area and shocked the entire com\u00ad\nmunity. The accompanying barrage of local media cover\u00ad\nage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As\nEnron\u2019s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the\nstorm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not\nconstitutionally compel a change of venue, they required\nthe District Court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which\nprospective jurors\u2019 attitudes about the case were closely\nscrutinized. The District Court\u2019s inquiry lacked the neces\u00ad\nsary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether\nthe jury empaneled to decide Skilling\u2019s case was capable of\nrendering an impartial decision based solely on the evi\u00ad\ndence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would\n2                SKILLING v.

The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.\nVirtually overnight, what had been the city\u2019s \u201clargest,\nmost visible, and most prosperous company,\u201d its \u201cforemost\nsocial and charitable force,\u201d and \u201ca source of civic pride\u201d\nwas reduced to a \u201cshattered shell.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b611, 13, pp.\n649a\u2013650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company\u2019s employ\u00ad\nees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings van\u00ad\nish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,\nthousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses\nshuttered, and community groups that once benefited from\nEnron\u2019s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in con\u00ad\ntributions. See, e.g., 3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also\n554 F. 3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (\u201cAccounting firms that\nserviced Enron\u2019s books had less work, hotels had more\nopen rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on\u201d).\nEnron\u2019s community ties were so extensive that the entire\nlocal U.

See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).\n   With Enron\u2019s demise affecting the lives of so many\nHoustonians, local media coverage of the story saturated\nthe community.

A Chronicle report on\nSkilling\u2019s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the\ncoverage. It began, \u201cAcross Houston, Enron employees\nwatched former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling\u2019s congres\u00ad\nsional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry\nand then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy\nand detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance\nabout critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed\nenergy giant.\u201d App. 1218a. \u201c \u2018He is lying; he knew every\u00ad\nthing,\u2019 said [an employee], who said she had seen Skilling\nfrequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling\nwas known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at\nthe company. \u2018I am getting sicker by the minute.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n1219a.

The conventional wisdom that blame for\nEnron\u2019s devastating implosion and the ensuing human\ntragedy ultimately rested with Skilling and former Enron\nChairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the\npopular imagination that references to their involvement\neven turned up on the sports pages: \u201cIf you believe the\nstory about [Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do\nwith the end of Emmitt Smith\u2019s Cowboys career, then you\nprobably believe in other far-fetched concepts.

A\nChronicle editorial opined that \u201cCausey\u2019s admission of\nsecurities fraud . . . . makes less plausible Lay\u2019s claim that\nmost of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial\npressure rather than actual wrongdoing.\u201d Id., at 12391.\n   With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling re\u00ad\nnewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the\nquestionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea con\u00ad\nfirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In\nthe alternative, Skilling asserted that \u201cdefendants are\nentitled to a more thorough jury selection process than\ncurrently envisioned by the [c]ourt.\u201d Id., at 12067. The\ncourt had announced its intention to question individual\njurors at the bench with one attorney for each side pre\u00ad\nsent, and to complete the voir dire in a single day. See,\ne.g., id., at 11804\u201311805, 11808. Skilling proposed, inter\nalia, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in\nquestioning, id., at 12074; that jurors be questioned pri\u00ad\nvately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would\nbe easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,\nclients, and jury consultants, id., at 12070\u201312072; and\nthat the court \u201cavoid leading questions,\u201d which \u201ctend to\n[e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that\nmay not reflect their actual views,\u201d id., at 12072. At a\nminimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a\ncontinuance of at least 30 days and send a revised ques\u00ad\ntionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. Id., at\n12074\u201312075.\n   The District Court denied Skilling\u2019s motion without a\nhearing, stating in a brief order that it was \u201cnot persuaded\nthat the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . .\nestablish that pretrial publicity and/or community preju\u00ad\ndice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d Id.,\nat 14115. According to the court, the \u201cjury questionnaires\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the\ncourt\u2019s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide\nadequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the\nselection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.\u201d Id., at\n14115\u201314116. The court did agree to delay the trial by\ntwo weeks, until January 30, 2006.\n  The coming trial featured prominently in local news\noutlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle\ndescribed \u201cthe hurt and anger and resentment\u201d that had\nbeen \u201cchurn[ing] inside\u201d Houstonians since Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse. Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for\noffering a \u201cdoofus defense\u201d (\u201ca plea of not guilty by reason\nof empty-headedness\u201d), the paper stated that \u201cLay and\nSkilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet\nnow fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.\u201d\nIbid. The article allowed that the defendants\u2019 guilt,\n\u201cthough perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an\nassertion. A jury now takes up the task of deciding\nwhether that assertion is valid.\u201d Id., at 39947. The next\nparagraph, however, assured readers that \u201cit\u2019s normal for\nyour skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe\u00ad\neyed innocence that they were unaware that something\nwas amiss at Enron. The company\u2019s utter failure belies\nthe claim.\u201d Ibid. (one paragraph break omitted); see also\nid., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would \u201chave\nto offer a convincing explanation for how executives once\ntouted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark\nabout the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their\nown company\u201d).\n  It is against this backdrop of widespread community\nimpact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection\nin Skilling\u2019s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective\njurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse lo\u00ad\ncated \u201cabout six blocks from Enron\u2019s former headquar\u00ad\nters.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the\nDistrict Court began by briefly describing the case and\n10                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nproviding a standard admonition about the need to be fair\nand impartial and to decide the case based solely on the\ntrial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked\nwhether anyone had \u201cany reservations about your ability\nto conscientiously and fairly follow these very important\nrules.\u201d App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands\nand were called forward to the bench. One told the court\nthat he thought Lay and Skilling \u201cknew exactly what they\nwere doing\u201d and would have to prove their innocence. Id.,\nat 818a\u2013819a. The second juror, who had stated on his\nwritten questionnaire that he held no opinion that would\npreclude him from being impartial, declared that he\n\u201cwould dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to\nclaim responsibility, at least 1\u204412 of the responsibility, for\nputting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their\nlives.\u201d Id., at 819a\u2013820a. The court excused both jurors\nfor cause.\n   The court proceeded to question individual jurors from\nthe bench. As the majority recounts, ante, at 7\u20138, the\ncourt asked them a few general yes/no questions about\ntheir exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of,\n\u201cDo you recall any particular articles that stand out that\nyou\u2019ve read about the case?\u201d App. 850a. The court also\nasked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,\nfocusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly\npartial comments, the prospective jurors believed they\n\u201ccould be fair\u201d and \u201cput the government to its proof.\u201d Id.,\nat 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues\nraised by the court. The court made clear, however, that\nits patience would be limited, see, e.g., id., at 879a, and\nquestioning tended to be brief\u2014generally less than five\nminutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying\nbiases among several prospective jurors who had earlier\nexpressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 See   App. 894a (Juror 43) (expressed the view that the defendants\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Once it identified 38 qualified prospective jurors, the\ncourt allowed the defense and Government to exercise\ntheir allotted peremptory challenges. This left 12 jurors\nand 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for\nthe first time, \u201cnot [to] read anything dealing with the\ncase or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or\ntelevision or access any Internet sites that may deal with\nthe case\u201d and to \u201cinform your friends and family members\nthat they should not discuss with you anything they may\nhave read or heard about this case.\u201d Id., at 1026a. Start\nto finish, the selection process took about five hours.\n  Skilling\u2019s trial commenced the next day and lasted four\nmonths. After several days of deliberations, the jury\nfound Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities\nfraud, 5 counts of making false representations to audi\u00ad\ntors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 in\u00ad\nsider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all\ncounts.\n  On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his\nconstitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\nAddressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by\ndisavowing the District Court\u2019s findings concerning \u201ccom\u00ad\nmunity hostility.\u201d There was, the court concluded, \u201csuffi\u00ad\ncient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding\nof presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense\nvolume of coverage.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 559. \u201c[P]rejudice was\n[also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator\u2019s well\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cstole money\u201d from their employees); id., at 922a (Juror 55) (admitted\nthat she \u201clean[ed] towards prejudging\u201d the defendants); id., at 946a\n(Juror 71) (stated that she would place the burden of proof on the\ndefendants); id., at 954a\u2013960a (Juror 75) (indicated that she could not\nset aside her view that there was fraud at Enron); id., at 1003a\u20131006a\n(Juror 104) (stated that she questioned the defendants\u2019 innocence and\nthat she \u201cwould be very upset with the government if they could not\nprove their case\u201d); id., at 1008a (Juror 112) (expressed that the view\nthat the defendants were guilty).\n12              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\npublicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.\u201d\nIbid. The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District\nCourt for failing to \u201cconsider the wider context.\u201d Id., at\n560. \u201c[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess\nthe tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the\nvolume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the\nreal inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrele\u00ad\nvant sources.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]he district court\nseemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more\nthan just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer\nnumber of victims.\u201d Ibid.\n  Having determined that \u201cSkilling was entitled to a\npresumption of prejudice,\u201d the Court of Appeals proceeded\nto explain that \u201cthe presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the\ngovernment may demonstrate from the voir dire that an\nimpartial jury was actually impanelled.\u201d Id., at 561 (in\u00ad\nternal quotation marks omitted). Describing the voir dire\nas \u201cexemplary,\u201d \u201csearching,\u201d and \u201cproper and thorough,\u201d\nid., at 562, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he government\n[had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that\nconvicted Skilling was impartial,\u201d id., at 564\u2013565. On this\nbasis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling\u2019s claim and\naffirmed his convictions.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and\nthe due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guaran\u00ad\ntee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside\npreconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and\ndecide guilt or innocence \u201cbased on the evidence presented\nin court.\u201d Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see\nalso Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966).\nCommunity passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial\npublicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsome instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of\nthe community becomes so severe as to give rise to a \u201cpre\u00ad\nsumption of [juror] prejudice.\u201d Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S.\n1025, 1031 (1984).\n   The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of pre\u00ad\nsumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework:\nOnce the defendant musters sufficient evidence of com\u00ad\nmunity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to\nprove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly\nenvisions a fixed point at which public passions become so\nintense that prejudice to a defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights\nmust be presumed. The majority declines, however, to\ndecide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the\nCourt of Appeals held.\n   This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive\nprejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely\nconvey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of\npublic enmity rises, so too does the danger that the preju\u00ad\ndices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The under\u00ad\nlying question has always been this: Do we have confi\u00ad\ndence that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cinduced only by evidence\nand argument in open court, and not by any outside influ\u00ad\nence, whether of private talk or public print\u201d? Patterson v.\nColorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U. S. 454,\n462 (1907).\n   The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a\njury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the\nintensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial\npublicity and community animus.           Reviewing courts,\nmeanwhile, must assess whether the trial court\u2019s proce\u00ad\ndures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury\nfree from disqualifying bias. Cf. Murphy v. Florida, 421\nU. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for \u201cany\nindications in the totality of circumstances that peti\u00ad\ntioner\u2019s trial was not fundamentally fair\u201d). This Court\u2019s\nprecedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different\n14              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsituations to safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional right\nto a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n   At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare\noccasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circum\u00ad\nstances that it has reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction\n\u201cwithout pausing to examine . . . the voir dire examination\nof the members of the jury.\u201d Rideau v. Louisiana, 373\nU. S. 723, 727 (1963). In Rideau, repeated television\nbroadcasts of the defendant\u2019s confession to murder, rob\u00ad\nbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local senti\u00ad\nment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir\ndire could have secured an impartial jury. A change of\nvenue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to\nassure a fair trial. Ibid.; see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a723.2(a), p. 264\n(3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (\u201cThe best reading of\nRideau is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial\npublicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that\nthe voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the\nlikely prejudice among prospective jurors\u201d).\n   As the majority describes, ante, at 14, this Court\nreached similar conclusions in Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S.\n532 (1965), and Sheppard, 384 U. S. 333. These cases\ninvolved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media\ndisruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argu\u00ad\nment that the defendants were not entitled to relief from\ntheir convictions because they \u201cha[d] established no isola\u00ad\ntable prejudice,\u201d the Court described the \u201cuntoward cir\u00ad\ncumstances\u201d as \u201cinherently suspect.\u201d Estes, 381 U. S., at\n542, 544. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to\nhave been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the \u201cbed\u00ad\nlam\u201d that surrounded them. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355.\nCriticizing the trial courts\u2019 failures \u201cto protect the jury\nfrom outside influence,\u201d id., at 358, the Court stressed\nthat, \u201cwhere there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudi\u00ad\ncial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nshould continue the case until the threat abates, or trans\u00ad\nfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.\u201d\nId., at 363. Estes and Sheppard thus applied Rideau\u2019s\ninsight that in particularly extreme circumstances even\nthe most rigorous voir dire cannot suffice to dispel the\nreasonable likelihood of jury bias.\n   Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has\ndeclined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead\nexamined the particulars of the jury selection process to\ndetermine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted\nby pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court\nhas recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant\npervades the community there is a high risk that biased\njurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is\nnot merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately\nhide their prejudices, but also that, as \u201cpart of a commu\u00ad\nnity deeply hostile to the accused,\u201d \u201cthey may unwittingly\n[be] influenced\u201d by the fervor that surrounds them. Mur\nphy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in such\nadverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully con\u00ad\nsider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors\nand then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assur\u00ad\nances of fairness. Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719,\n729 (1992) (\u201c[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right\nto an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify\nunqualified jurors\u201d).\n   Irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial\ncourt\u2019s voir dire did not suffice to counter the \u201cwave of\npublic passion\u201d that had swept the community prior to the\ndefendant\u2019s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news media\nhad \u201cextensively covered\u201d the crimes (a murder spree),\n\u201carous[ing] great excitement and indignation.\u201d Id., at 719\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin\u2019s\narrest, the press \u201cblanketed\u201d the community with \u201ca bar\u00ad\nrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pic\u00ad\ntures\u201d communicating numerous unfavorable details about\n16               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nIrvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. Id., at\n725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors ex\u00ad\namined during the trial court\u2019s voir dire \u201centertained some\nopinion as to guilt\u2014ranging in intensity from mere suspi\u00ad\ncion to absolute certainty.\u201d Id., at 727. Of the 12 jurors\nseated, 8 \u201cthought petitioner was guilty,\u201d although \u201ceach\nindicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could ren\u00ad\nder an impartial verdict.\u201d Id., at 727, 724.\n    Despite the seated jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality,\nthis Court invalidated Irvin\u2019s conviction for want of due\nprocess. \u201cIt is not required,\u201d this Court declared, \u201cthat the\njurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\n. . . It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression\nor opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence\npresented in court.\u201d Id., at 722\u2013723. The Court empha\u00ad\nsized, however, that a juror\u2019s word on this matter is not\ndecisive, particularly when \u201cthe build-up of prejudice [in\nthe community] is clear and convincing.\u201d Id., at 725.\nMany of Irvin\u2019s jurors, the Court noted, had been influ\u00ad\nenced by \u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown\nto be present throughout the community.\u201d Id., at 727\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not\n\u201cdoubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he\nwould be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so\nmany, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a state\u00ad\nment of impartiality can be given little weight.\u201d Id., at\n728.\n    The media coverage and community animosity in Irvin\nwas particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this\nCourt recognized that high-profile cases may generate\nsubstantial publicity without stirring similar public pas\u00ad\nsions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court\nclarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case\nsuch as Irvin. So long as the trial court conducts a rea\u00ad\nsonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the abil\u00ad\nity of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S. 794, involved\na well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publi\u00ad\ncized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied\nhis motion for a change of venue and during voir dire\nexcused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distin\u00ad\nguishing Irvin, this Court saw no indication in the voir\ndire of \u201csuch hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who\nserved in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not\nbe laid aside.\u201d 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors\n\u201chad a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Mur\u00ad\nphy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his]\npast crimes,\u201d \u201cnone betrayed any belief in the relevance of\n[Murphy\u2019s] past to the present case.\u201d Ibid.; see also ibid.,\nn. 4 (contrasting a juror\u2019s \u201cmere familiarity with [a defen\u00ad\ndant] or his past\u201d with \u201can actual predisposition against\nhim\u201d). \u201c[T]hese indicia of impartiality,\u201d the Court sug\u00ad\ngested, \u201cmight be disregarded in a case where the general\natmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently\ninflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Mur\u00ad\nphy\u2019s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.\u201d Id., at 802.\n  In a second case, Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, the defendant\nwas granted a new trial four years after being convicted of\nmurder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial\npublicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had\npreviously been convicted and had made confessions that\nwould be inadmissible in court. The state trial court\ndenied Yount\u2019s motion and seated a jury following a 10\u00ad\nday voir dire of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Of course, even if the jury selection process is adequate, a trial court\n\nviolates a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies\na for-cause challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on\nthe jury. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S. 304,\n316 (2000) (\u201c[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed\nfor cause . . . would require reversal\u201d).\n18               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nprospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent\n\u201cadmitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.\u201d\nId., at 1029. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas\nreview, this Court stressed the significant interval be\u00ad\ntween Yount\u2019s first trial\u2014when \u201cadverse publicity and the\ncommunity\u2019s sense of outrage were at their height\u201d\u2014and\nhis second trial, which \u201cdid not occur until four years later,\nat a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly dimin\u00ad\nished and community sentiment had softened.\u201d Id., at\n1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had\n\u201cat some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt,\u201d\nthe \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d voir dire confirmed that \u201ctime\nhad weakened or eliminated any\u201d bias they once may have\nharbored. Id., at 1029\u20131030, 1034, n. 10, 1033. Accord\u00ad\ningly, this Court concluded, \u201cthe trial court did not commit\nmanifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was\nimpartial.\u201d Id., at 1032.\n   This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of\npretrial publicity in Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415\n(1991). Mu\u2019Min stood accused of murdering a woman\nwhile out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper\narticles about the crime, Mu\u2019Min moved for a change of\nvenue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and at\u00ad\ntempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of\nthe 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard\nabout the case from media or other sources. Dividing\nthese prospective jurors into panels of four, the court\nasked further general questions about their ability to be\nfair given what they had heard or read. One juror an\u00ad\nswered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The\ncourt refused Mu\u2019Min\u2019s request to ask more specific ques\u00ad\ntions \u201crelating to the content of news items that potential\njurors might have read or seen.\u201d Id., at 419. Of the 12\npersons who served on the jury, \u201c8 had at one time or\nanother read or heard something about the case. None\nhad indicated that he had formed an opinion about the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncase or would be biased in any way.\u201d Id., at 421.\n   Rejecting Mu\u2019Min\u2019s attempt to analogize his case to\nIrvin, this Court observed that \u201cthe cases differ both in the\nkind of community in which the coverage took place and in\nextent of media coverage.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429. Mu\u2019Min\u2019s\noffense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C.,\narea, \u201cwhich has a population of over 3 million, and in\nwhich, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed\neach year.\u201d Ibid. While the crime garnered \u201csubstantial\u201d\npretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in\nIrvin and \u201cdid not contain the same sort of damaging\ninformation.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429\u2013430. Moreover, in con\u00ad\ntrast to Irvin, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed\nhaving ever formed an opinion about the case. Given\nthese circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu\u2019Min\u2019s asser\u00ad\ntion that the trial court committed constitutional error by\ndeclining to \u201cmake precise inquiries about the contents of\nany news reports that potential jurors have read.\u201d 500\nU. S., at 424. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling\nwas context-specific: \u201cHad the trial court in this case been\nconfronted with the \u2018wave of public passion\u2019 engendered by\npretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin\u2019s\ntrial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment might well have required more extensive examina\u00ad\ntion of potential jurors than it undertook here.\u201d Id., at\n429.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to determine how this case compares to\nour existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances\nso inherently prejudicial that, as in Rideau, even the most\nscrupulous voir dire would have been \u201cbut a hollow formal\u00ad\nity\u201d incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury? 373\nU. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not of this charac\u00ad\nter, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process\nsufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and\n20              SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncommunity animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable\nof presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial\ninfluences?\n                              A\n   Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that\nthe prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was\nnot so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District\nCourt acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\u2019s mo\u00ad\ntion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this\nconclusion. First, as the Court observes, ante, at 16, the\nsize and diversity of the Houston community make it\nprobable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number\nof persons who were unaffected by Enron\u2019s collapse, neu\u00ad\ntral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the\npublic furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while\nubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court\npoints out, ante, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or\nsimilar \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence of specific criminal acts.\nFor many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefen\u00ad\ndant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the\npleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt\nsuggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds\nexposed to such information would not necessarily have\nformed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was\nguilty as charged. Cf. Rideau, 373 U. S., at 726 (a major\u00ad\nity of the county\u2019s residents were \u201cexposed repeatedly and\nin depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing\nin detail to the crimes with which he was later to be\ncharged\u201d). Third, there is no suggestion that the court\u00ad\nroom in this case became, as in Estes and Sheppard, a\n\u201ccarnival\u201d in which the \u201ccalmness and solemnity\u201d of the\nproceedings was compromised. Sheppard, 384 U. S., at\n358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus\nappropriate to examine the voir dire and determine\nwhether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the\n                       Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                        21\n\n                         Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\njury actually selected.9\n                                B\n   In concluding that the voir dire \u201cadequately detect[ed]\nand defuse[d] juror bias,\u201d ante, at 20, the Court downplays\nthe extent of the community\u2019s antipathy toward Skilling\nand exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.\nThe devastating impact of Enron\u2019s collapse and the relent\u00ad\nless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the\npart of the District Court to ensure the seating of an im\u00ad\npartial jury. While the procedures employed by the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court might have been adequate in the typical high\u00ad\nprofile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary\ncircumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling\u2019s constitu\u00ad\ntional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Whether   the District Court abused its discretion in declining to\nchange venue pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a\ndifferent question. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 21(a) (\u201cUpon the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that\ndefendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a\nprejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that\nthe defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there\u201d). As this\nCourt has indicated, its supervisory powers confer \u201cmore latitude\u201d to set\nstandards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.\nMu\u2019Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 424 (1991). While the circumstances\nmay not constitutionally compel a change of venue \u201cwithout pausing to\nexamine . . . the voir dire,\u201d Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723, 727\n(1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the\ncommunity\u2019s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that\nthe task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major chal\u00ad\nlenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far\neasier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story\nhad less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c[i]t\nwould not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have\ngranted Skilling\u2019s transfer motion.\u201d 554 F. 3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009).\nSkilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers\nclaim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth\nCircuit, see id., at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. ante, at\n12, n. 11.\n22               SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the \u201cwide\ndiscretion\u201d owed to trial courts when it comes to jury\u00ad\nrelated issues. Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. ante, at 20\u2013\n21. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public\nsentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Prox\u00ad\nimity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons\nin the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.\n\u201c[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an\nindependent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d Sheppard,\n384 U. S., at 362. In particular, reviewing courts are well\nqualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented\nprocedures adequate to keep community prejudices from\ninfecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not\nbefit the circumstances of the case, the trial court\u2019s rulings\non impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See\nMorgan, 504 U. S., at 729\u2013730 (\u201c \u2018Without an adequate\nvoir dire the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospec\u00ad\ntive jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the\ncourt\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be\nfulfilled\u2019 \u201d (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451\nU. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also\nMu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cOur\nwillingness to accord substantial deference to a trial\ncourt\u2019s finding of juror impartiality rests on our expecta\u00ad\ntion that the trial court will conduct a sufficient voir dire\nto determine the credibility of a juror professing to be\nimpartial\u201d).\n                             1\n   As the Court of Appeals apprehended, the District Court\ngave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public\nhostility. For Houstonians, Enron\u2019s collapse was an event\nof once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the\nvolume of media coverage \u201cimmense\u201d and frequently in\u00ad\ntemperate, but \u201cthe sheer number of victims\u201d created a\nclimate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthe desire for conviction was widely shared. 554 F. 3d, at\n559\u2013560.\n   The level of public animus toward Skilling dwarfed that\npresent in cases such as Murphy and Mu\u2019Min. The pre\u00ad\ntrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news\nreports, most of which were \u201clargely factual in nature.\u201d\nMurphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no indication that\nthe relevant communities had been captivated by the\ncases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In\ncontrast, the number of media reports in this case reached\nthe tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of\nSkilling were common. The much closer analogy is thus to\nIrvin, which similarly featured a \u201cbarrage\u201d of media cover\u00ad\nage and a \u201chuge . . . wave of public passion,\u201d 366 U. S., at\n725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve\ndirect harm to entire segments of the community.10\n   Attempting to distinguish Irvin, the majority suggests\nthat Skilling\u2019s economic offenses were less incendiary than\nIrvin\u2019s violent crime spree and that \u201cnews stories about\nEnron contained nothing resembling the horrifying infor\u00ad\nmation rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies\nand murders.\u201d Ante, at 28. Along similar lines, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court described \u201cthe facts of this case [as] neither\nheinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to Brief for United States\n10a. The majority also points to the four years that\npassed between Enron\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy and the\nstart of Skilling\u2019s trial, asserting that \u201cthe decibel level of\nmedia attention diminished somewhat\u201d over this time.\nAnte, at 17. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n   First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread\ncommunity outrage more readily than crimes involving\nmonetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 10 One of Skilling\u2019s experts noted that, \u201c[i]n cases involving 200 or\n\nmore articles, trial judges granted a change of venue 59% of the time.\u201d\nApp. \u00b630, p. 611a.\n24                    SKILLING v.

Indeed, the record in this case is\nreplete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling\nand other Enron executives. See, e.g., Record 39946\n(front-page, eve-of-trial story describing \u201cthe hurt and\nanger and resentment . . . churn[ing] inside\u201d the people of\nHouston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other\nthings, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terror\u00ad\nist.11 As one commentator observed, \u201c[i]t\u2019s a sign of how\nshocked Houstonians are about Enron\u2019s ignominious\ndemise that Sept. 11 can be invoked\u2014and is frequently\u2014\nto explain the shock of the company\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp.\nRecord 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and\nother top executives hired private security to protect\nthemselves from persons inclined to take the law into their\nown hands. See, e.g., App. 1154a (\u201cAfter taking the tem\u00ad\nperature of Enron\u2019s victims, [a local lawyer] says the\nEnron executives are wise to take security precautions\u201d).\n   Second, the passage of time did little to soften commu\u00ad\nnity sentiment. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, ante,\nat 17, this case in no way resembles Yount, where, by the\ntime of the defendant\u2019s retrial, \u201cprejudicial publicity [had]\ngreatly diminished\u201d and community animus had signifi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 See, e.g., 554 F. 3d, at 559, n. 42 (\u201cI\u2019m livid, absolutely livid . . . .

The Enron\nstory was a continuing saga, and \u201cpublicity remained\nintense throughout.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at 560. Not only did\nEnron\u2019s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but\nso too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related\nevents.12 Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty\nplea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling\u2019s\ntrial. If anything, the time that elapsed between the\nbankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an\nunbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members\nof the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related\nguilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their\ncertainty that Skilling too had engaged in\u2014if not master\u00ad\nminded\u2014criminal acts, particularly given that the media\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress,\n\nand other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights;\nEnron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and\nsentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force\ncharged Enron CFO and Skilling-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Andrew Fastow with fraud,\nmoney laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees\npleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task\nForce indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr.\n(the company\u2019s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant\ntreasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband\nServices; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received\nprison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.\nIn 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and\nCausey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding\nLay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered\nguilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers\nwere defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal\ninvolving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held\nin Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various\npretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay,\nand Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey\npleaded guilty to securities fraud.\n26                SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncoverage reinforced this view. See supra, at 7\u20138. The trial\nof Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had\ncome before. See Record 40002 (noting that \u201cprosecutors\nfollowed the classic pattern of working their way up\nthrough the ranks\u201d). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,\nshortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services\nexecutives ended without convictions, \u201cThe real trial, the\ntrue measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in Janu\u00ad\nary. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We\u2019ve got\nbigger fish in need of frying.\u201d App. 1460a (paragraph\nbreaks omitted); see also ibid. (\u201cFrom the beginning, the\nEnron prosecution has had one true measure of success:\nLay and Skilling in a cold steel cage\u201d).\n   Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston\ncommunity remained overwhelmingly negative was dis\u00ad\npelled by prospective jurors\u2019 responses to the written\nquestionnaires. As previously indicated, supra, at 5\u20137,\nmore than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew\nvictims of Enron\u2019s collapse or were victims themselves,\nand two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen\u00ad\ndant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling\nwas palpable. See nn. 4, 6, supra. Only a small fraction of\nthe prospective jurors raised no red flags in their re\u00ad\nsponses. And this was before Causey\u2019s guilty plea and the\nflurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of\ntrial. One of Skilling\u2019s experts, a political scientist who\nhad studied pretrial publicity \u201cfor over 35 years\u201d and\nconsulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he\nhad recommended against venue changes more often than\nnot), \u201cc[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of\nbias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at\nleast one of the very highest I have ever encountered.\u201d\nApp. \u00b6\u00b62, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).\n                              2\n     Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n362. As this Court has recognized, \u201c[i]n a community\nwhere most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying preju\u00ad\ndice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations may be\ndrawn into question.\u201d Murphy, 421 U. S., at 803; see also\nGroppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 510 (1971) (\u201c \u2018[A]ny\njudge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms\nthey are extremely likely to be impregnated by the envi\u00ad\nroning atmosphere\u2019 \u201d (quoting Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.\n309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps be\u00ad\ncause it had underestimated the public\u2019s antipathy toward\nSkilling, the District Court\u2019s 5-hour voir dire was mani\u00ad\nfestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.13\n  As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the\n\nthree previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were simi\u00ad\nlarly brief. See ante, at 23. The circumstances of those cases, however,\nwere very different. In particular, the defendants had not been person\u00ad\nally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism\nthat had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, e.g.,\nsupra, at 25\u201326, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely\nseen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclu\u00ad\nsion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice\nto select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the\nprocesses used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.\n  Moreover, in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case, I do\nnot mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the\nadequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one,\nshould be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always\ntake care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a\ndefendant\u2019s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court\u00ad\nled versus attorney-led voir dire. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,\nand I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial\njury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the\nscope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.\n28                  SKILLING v.

In fact, the court asked very\nfew prospective jurors any questions directed to their\nknowledge of or feelings about that event.14 Considering\nhow much news the plea generated, many more than two\nvenire members were likely aware of it. The lack of ques\u00ad\ntioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea\non those jurors impossible to assess.\n   The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to de\u00ad\nscribe personal interactions they may have had about the\ncase, or to consider whether they might have difficulty\navoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or\ncolleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The\ntidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects\nprovided cause for concern. In response to general media\u00ad\nrelated questions, several prospective jurors volunteered\nthat they had spoken with others about the case. Juror\n74, for example, indicated that her husband was the \u201cnews\nperson,\u201d that they had \u201ctalked about it,\u201d that she had also\nheard things \u201cfrom work,\u201d and that what she heard was\n\u201call negative, of course.\u201d App. 948a. The court, however,\ndid not seek elaboration about the substance of these\ninteractions. Surely many prospective jurors had similar\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court\u2019s\n\nquestion about whether he \u201crecall[ed] listening to any particular\nprograms about the case.\u201d App. 888a. Juror 96, meanwhile, told the\ncourt that he read the \u201cwhole\u201d Houston Chronicle every day, including\n\u201call the articles about Enron.\u201d Id., at 992a. The court, however, did not\nask any questions designed to elicit information about the Causey plea.\nInstead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling\u2019s counsel\nmanaged to squeeze in a follow-up as to whether he had \u201cread about\nany guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two.\u201d Id., at 993a.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Yet this too was a subject\nthe District Court did not adequately explore. On the few\noccasions when prospective jurors were asked whether\nthey would feel pressure from the public to convict, they\nacknowledged that it might be difficult to return home\nafter delivering a not-guilty verdict. Juror 75, for in\u00ad\nstance, told the court, \u201cI think a lot of people feel that\nthey\u2019re guilty. And maybe they\u2019re expecting something to\ncome out of this trial.\u201d Id., at 956a. It would be \u201ctough,\u201d\nshe recognized, \u201cto vote not guilty and go back into the\ncommunity.\u201d Id., at 957a; see also id., at 852a (Juror 10)\n(admitting \u201csome hesitancy\u201d about \u201ctelling people the\ngovernment didn\u2019t prove its case\u201d).\n  With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the\nDistrict Court\u2019s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly\ntroubling.15 Although Juror 101 responded in the negative\nwhen asked whether she had \u201cread anything in the news\u00ad\npaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,\u201d she volunteered that\nshe \u201cjust heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling\nand Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and\nthat there was an insurance policy that they could collect\non, also.\u201d Id., at 998a. This information, she explained,\n\u201cwas just something I overheard today\u2014other jurors\ntalking.\u201d Ibid. It seemed suspicious, she intimated, \u201cto\nhave an insurance policy ahead of time.\u201d Id., at 999a. The\ncourt advised her that \u201cmost corporations provide insur\u00ad\nance for their officers and directors.\u201d Ibid. The court,\nhowever, did not investigate the matter further, even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Portions of the voir dire transcript erroneously refer to this pro\u00ad\n\nspective juror as \u201cJuror 110.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 996a.\n30                 SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthough it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to\ntalk to each other about the case. Id., at 843a. It is thus\nnot apparent whether other prospective jurors also over\u00ad\nheard the information and whether they too believed that\nit reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it appar\u00ad\nent what other outside information may have been shared\namong the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101\u2019s\nstatements indicate that the court\u2019s questions were failing\nto bring to light the extent of jurors\u2019 exposure to poten\u00ad\ntially prejudicial facts and that some prospec-\ntive jurors were having difficulty following the court\u2019s\ndirectives.\n   The topics that the District Court did cover were ad\u00ad\ndressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were\nasked just a few yes/no questions about their general\nexposure to media coverage and a handful of additional\nquestions concerning any responses to the written ques\u00ad\ntionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their\nanswers were unenlightening.16 Yet the court rarely\nsought to draw them out with open-ended questions about\ntheir impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited\npatience for counsel\u2019s followup efforts. See, e.g., id., at\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Thecourt\u2019s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat on the jury) is typical:\n  \u201cQ.

S. ____ (2010)                      31\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n879a, 966a.17 When prospective jurors were more forth\u00ad\ncoming, their responses tended to highlight the ubiquity\nand negative tone of the local news coverage, thus under\u00ad\nscoring the need to press the more guarded members of\nthe venire for further information.18 Juror 17, for exam\u00ad\nple, mentioned hearing a radio program that very morning\nin which a former Enron employee compared persons who\ndid not think Skilling was guilty to Holocaust deniers. See\nid., at 863a (\u201c[H]e said he thought that he would find them\nguilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said\nthat it would be worse than a German trying to say that\nthey didn\u2019t kill the Jews\u201d).19 Other jurors may well have\nencountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary\nrhetoric.\n  These deficiencies in the form and content of the voir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 The  majority\u2019s criticism of Skilling\u2019s counsel for failing to ask ques\u00ad\ntions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. ante, at 23\u201324, is thus\nmisplaced. Given the District Court\u2019s express warning early in the voir\ndire that it would not allow counsel \u201cto ask individual questions if\n[they] abuse[d]\u201d that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for\ndeclining to test the court\u2019s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the\ncourt\u2019s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave\ncounsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.\n   18 Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the com\u00ad\n\nmunity hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial\npublicity, acknowledging that \u201call of us have been exposed to substan\u00ad\ntial media attention about this case.\u201d Id., at 841a. The court even\nmade an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions,\n\u201cthe Nigerian barge case,\u201d apparently expecting that the prospective\njurors would understand the reference. Id., at 840a.\n   19 Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective ju\u00ad\n\nrors, Juror 17 stated that he \u201cthought the guy [on the radio] was pretty\nnarrow minded,\u201d that \u201ceveryone should be considered innocent totally\nuntil they get a chance to come [to] court,\u201d and that the Government\nmight have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions.\nId., at 863a\u2013864a. He added, however, that he \u201cbelieve[d] there was\nprobably some accounting fraud [at Enron].\u201d Id., at 864a. The District\nCourt denied the Government\u2019s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,\nbut he did not ultimately sit on the jury.\n32                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ndire questions contributed to a deeper problem: The Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment\nof prospective jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality. Although\nthe Court insists otherwise, ante, at 26, the voir dire tran\u00ad\nscript indicates that the District Court essentially took\njurors at their word when they promised to be fair. In\u00ad\ndeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospec\u00ad\ntive juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impar\u00ad\ntiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.\nJuror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that\nSkilling was \u201cnot an honest man.\u201d App. 881a. During\nquestioning, she acknowledged having previously thought\nthe defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost\n$50,000\u2013$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse. Id., at 880a, 883a. But she ultimately agreed that\nshe would be able to presume innocence. Id., at 881a,\n884a. Noting that she \u201cblame[d] Enron for the loss of her\nmoney\u201d and appeared to have \u201cunshakeable bias,\u201d Skill\u00ad\ning\u2019s counsel challenged her for cause. Id., at 885a. The\ncourt, however, declined to remove her, stating that \u201cshe\nanswered candidly she\u2019s going to have an open mind now\u201d\nand \u201cagree[ing]\u201d with the Government\u2019s assertion that \u201cwe\nhave to take her at her word.\u201d Id., at 885a\u2013886a.20 As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 The  majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by\nnoting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a\nperemptory challenge to remove her. See ante, at 30, n. 31. The\nmajority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members\nwho were not ultimately seated. See ante, at 24, n. 24. The comments\nof these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impar\u00ad\ntiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly \u201cpart of a community\ndeeply hostile to the accused\u201d and who may have been \u201cunwittingly\ninfluenced by it.\u201d Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794, 803 (1975); see also\nIrvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the\nDistrict Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror\n29 goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire. If Juror 29 made it\nthrough to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confi\u00ad\ndence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    33\n\n                        Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthis Court has made plain, jurors\u2019 assurances of impartial\u00ad\nity simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic signifi\u00ad\ncance. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (\u201c[T]he juror\u2019s\nassurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be disposi\u00ad\ntive of the accused\u2019s rights\u201d); Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728\n(\u201cWhere so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, . . . a\nstatement of impartiality can be given little weight\u201d).\n   Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions\naccepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal\non their face. Prospective jurors who \u201chope[d]\u201d they could\npresume innocence and did \u201cnot necessarily\u201d think Skill\u00ad\ning was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App.\n932a, 857a. Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her\nquestionnaire, \u201cShame on him.\u201d Id., at 931a. Asked by\nthe court about this, she stated that, \u201cinnocent or guilty,\nhe was at the helm\u201d and \u201cshould have known what was\ngoing on at the company.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 934a\n(Skilling is \u201cprobably\u201d \u201cin the same boat as\u201d Lay). The\ncourt then asked, \u201ccan you presume, as you start this trial,\nthat Mr. Lay is innocent?\u201d Id., at 932a. She responded, \u201cI\nhope so, but you know. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t honestly\nanswer that one way or the other.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at\n933a (\u201cI bring in my past history. I bring in my biases. I\nwould like to think I could rise above those, but I\u2019ve never\nbeen in this situation before. So I don\u2019t know how I could\nhonestly answer that question one way or the other. . . . I\ndo have some concerns\u201d). Eventually, however, Juror 61\nanswered \u201cYes\u201d when the court asked if she would be able\nto acquit if she had \u201ca reasonable doubt that the defen\u00ad\ndants are guilty.\u201d Id., at 933a\u2013934a. Challenging her for\ncause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received\n\u201ca clear and unequivocal answer\u201d about her ability to be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nlittle is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave \u00a723.2(f), at 288 (\u201cThe\n\nresponses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated\n\njurors who were familiar with the same publicity\u201d). \n\n34                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nfair. Ibid. The court denied the challenge, stating, \u201cYou\nknow, she tried.\u201d Ibid.\n                               3\n  The majority takes solace in the fact that most of the\npersons actually seated as jurors and alternates \u201cspecifi\u00ad\ncally stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron\u00ad\nrelated news.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325, and n. 26.21 In context,\nhowever, these general declarations reveal little about the\nseated jurors\u2019 actual knowledge or views or the possible\npressure they might have felt to convict, and thus cannot\ninstill confidence that the jurors \u201cwere not under [the]\nsway\u201d of the prevailing community sentiment. Cf. ante, at\n25. Jurors who did not \u201cget into details\u201d of Enron\u2019s com\u00ad\nplicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless\nknew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that\nSkilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.\nJuror 63, for instance, told the court that she \u201cmay have\nheard a little bit\u201d about Enron-related litigation but had\nnot \u201creally pa[id] attention.\u201d Id., at 935a. Yet she was\nclearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire,\ndespite stating that she had not followed Enron-related\nnews, she wrote about \u201cwhistleblowers and Arthur Ander\u00ad\nsen lying about Enron\u2019s accounting,\u201d and she expressed\nthe view that Skilling and Lay \u201cprobably knew they were\nbreaking the law.\u201d Supp. App. 105sa\u2013106sa. During\nquestioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District\nCourt obtained no meaningful information about the\nactual extent of Juror 63\u2019s familiarity with the case or the\nbasis for her belief in Skilling\u2019s guilt. Yet it nevertheless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors\n\nand alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection. Ante, at\n24, and n. 25. This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and\nalternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost\njobs or money as a result of Enron\u2019s collapse\u2014a fact that does not strike\nme as particularly reassuring.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    35\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\naccepted her assurance that she could \u201cabsolutely\u201d pre\u00ad\nsume innocence. App. 937a.22\n   Indeed, the District Court\u2019s anemic questioning did little\nto dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numer\u00ad\nous other seated jurors and alternates. In my estimation,\nmore than half of those seated made written and oral\ncomments suggesting active antipathy toward the defen\u00ad\ndants. The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts\nthat \u201cSkilling\u2019s seated jurors . . . exhibited nothing like the\ndisplay of bias shown in Irvin.\u201d Ante, at 29. Juror 10, for\ninstance, reported on his written questionnaire that he\nknew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he\npersonally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual\nfund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from\nthe \u201cHouston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels,\nFox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]\nTexas Lawyer Magazine\u201d; that he believed Enron\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse \u201cwas due to greed and mismanagement\u201d; that \u201c[i]f\n[Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he\nwas really a poor manager/leader\u201d; and that the defen\u00ad\ndants were \u201csuspect.\u201d Supp. App. 11sa\u201319sa. During\nquestioning, he said he \u201cth[ought]\u201d he could presume\ninnocence and \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he could put the Government to\nits proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have\n\u201csome hesitancy\u201d \u201cin telling people the government didn\u2019t\nprove its case.\u201d App. 851a\u2013852a.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 As one of Skilling\u2019s jury experts observed, there is a \u201ctendency in\nvoir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their\nexposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any\nbiases they may have.\u201d App. 763a; see also id., at 637a (\u201cThose who\nperceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluc\u00ad\ntant to admit they cannot be fair\u201d). For this reason, the fact that \u201cnone\nof the seated jurors and alternates checked the \u2018yes\u2019 box\u201d on the written\nquestionnaire when \u201casked whether they \u2018ha[d] an opinion about\n[Skilling],\u2019 \u201d ante, at 26, is of minimal significance, particularly given\nthat the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant\nmedia coverage after the questionnaires were submitted.\n36                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  Juror 11 wrote that he \u201cwork[ed] with someone who\nworked at Enron\u201d; that he got Enron-related news from\nthe \u201cHouston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13\nNews, O\u2019Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co\u00ad\nworkers\u201d; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site;\nthat \u201cgreed on Enron\u2019s part\u201d caused the company\u2019s col\u00ad\nlapse; and that \u201ca lot of people were hurt financially.\u201d\nSupp. App. 26sa\u201330sa. During questioning, he stated that\nhe would have \u201cno problem\u201d requiring the Government to\nprove its case, but he also told the court that he believed\nLay was \u201cgreedy\u201d and that corporate executives are often\n\u201cstretching the legal limits . . . . I\u2019m not going to say that\nthey\u2019re all crooks, but, you know.\u201d App. 857a, 854a.\nAsked whether he would \u201cstar[t] the case with sort of an\ninkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done\nsomething illegal,\u201d he offered an indeterminate \u201cnot neces\u00ad\nsarily.\u201d Id., at 857.23\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly trou\u00ad\n\nbling sentiments. See, e.g., Supp. App. 57sa\u201360sa (Juror 20) (obtained\nEnron-related news from the Chronicle and \u201clocal news stations\u201d;\nblamed Enron\u2019s collapse on \u201c[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective\naudit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets\u201d; and\nwas \u201cangry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement\nsavings\u201d); id., at 72sa\u201375sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news\nfrom various sources, including the Chronicle; was \u201cangry about what\nhappened\u201d; and \u201cfe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and invested in\nthe corp[oration] only to have it all taken away\u201d); id., at 117sa\u2013118sa\n(Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money;\nheard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as\n\u201csad\u201d because \u201cpeople lost jobs [and] money\u2014lots of money\u201d; and\nbelieved the Government \u201cdid the right thing\u201d in its investigation); id.,\nat 177sa\u2013181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the\nChronicle, Channel 13 news, the O\u2019Reilly Factor, Internet news sources,\nand friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron\u2019s collapse to\n\u201c[p]oor management [and] bad judgment\u2014greed\u201d; lamented \u201c[t]he sad\nstate of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their\nretirement accounts\u201d; and \u201cadmire[d] [the] bravery\u201d of Enron whistle\u00ad\nblower Sherron Watkins \u201cfor bringing the situation to the attention of\nthe public, which stopped things from getting worse\u201d); id., at 191sa\u2013\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Juror 13, for\ninstance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard\nabout the Enron cases from the \u201c[n]ews.\u201d Supp. App. 42sa.\nThe court questioned him for two minutes, during which\ntime he confirmed that he had \u201cheard what\u2019s on the news,\nbasically,\u201d including \u201cthat the trial had moved from the\n17th to the 31st.\u201d He added that the story \u201cwas all over\nthe news on every detail of Enron.\u201d App. 858a\u2013860a. No\nmeaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes\nwas obtained. Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not\nfollowed Enron-related news but was aware that \u201c[m]any\npeople lost their jobs.\u201d Supp. App. 151sa. The court ques\u00ad\ntioned her for less than 90 seconds. During that time, she\nacknowledged that she had \u201ccaught glimpses\u201d of the cov\u00ad\nerage and \u201ckn[e]w generally, you know, that the company\nwent bankrupt\u201d and that there \u201cwere some employees that\nwent off and did their own businesses.\u201d App. 969a. Little\nmore was learned.24\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news from his wife, co-workers,\nand television; wrote that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not right for someone . . . to take\u201d away\nthe money that the \u201csmall average worker saves . . . for retirement all\nhis life\u201d; and described the Government\u2019s Enron investigation as \u201ca\ngood thing\u201d); id., at 221sa\u2013225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information\nabout Enron from a \u201cco-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs.\nFastow\u2019s trial\u201d; worked for an employer who lost money as a result of\nEnron\u2019s collapse; found it \u201csad\u201d that the collapse had affected \u201csuch a\nhuge number of people\u201d; and thought \u201csomeone had to be doing some\u00ad\nthing illegal\u201d); id., at 236sa\u2013237sa (Juror 116) (knew a colleague who\nlost money in Enron\u2019s collapse; obtained Enron-related news from the\n\u201cHouston Chronicle, Time Magazine, local TV news [and] radio, friends,\nfamily, [and] co-workers, [and] internet news sources\u201d; and noted\nthat what stood out was \u201c[t]he employees and retirees that lost their\nsavings\u201d).\n  24 Several other jurors fell into this category. Juror 67 wrote on his\n38                  SKILLING v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n   In assessing the likelihood that bias lurked in the minds\nof at least some of these seated jurors, I find telling the\nway in which voir dire played out. When the District\nCourt asked the prospective jurors as a group whether\nthey had any reservations about their ability to presume\ninnocence and put the Government to its proof, only two\nanswered in the affirmative, and both were excused for\ncause. Id., at 815a\u2013820a. The District Court\u2019s individual\nquestioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying\nprejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors\nwho had earlier expressed no concerns about their impar\u00ad\ntiality. See n. 7, supra. It thus strikes me as highly likely\nthat at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that\nthey could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more\nprobing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. Yount,\n467 U. S., at 1034, n. 10 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cparticularly extensive\u201d 10-day voir dire assured the jury\u2019s\nimpartiality).25\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nquestionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle and\n\u201cInternet news sources.\u201d Id., at 133sa. He was questioned for 90\nseconds, during which time he indicated that he had read an article on\nthe Internet the preceding night \u201cabout the jury selection taking place\ntoday, stuff like that.\u201d App. 944a. Juror 99 wrote that she had not\nheard or read about the Enron cases and did not \u201cknow anything about\u201d\nEnron. Supp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely\none minute. She stated that she had \u201c[n]ot really\u201d learned more about\nthe case, but added that she had heard \u201cthis and that\u201d from her par\u00ad\nents. App. 995a\u2013996a. The court did not press further.\n  25 The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling \u201cchallenged only\n\none of the seated jurors for cause\u201d indicates that he did not believe the\nother jurors were biased. Ante, at 30. Our decisions, however, distin\u00ad\nguish claims involving \u201cthe partiality of an individual juror\u201d from\nantecedent claims directed at \u201cthe partiality of the trial jury as a\nwhole.\u201d Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025, 1036 (1984); see also Frazier v.\nUnited States, 335 U. S. 497, 514 (1948) (\u201c[T]he two sorts of challenge[s]\nare distinct and are therefore to be dealt with separately\u201d). If the jury\nselection process does not, as here, give a defendant a fair opportunity\nto identify biased jurors, the defendant can hardly be faulted for failing\nto make for-cause challenges.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           39\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n  The majority suggests, ante, at 17\u201318, 30, that the jury\u2019s\ndecision to acquit Skilling on nine relatively minor insider\ntrading charges confirms its impartiality. This argument,\nhowever, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vin\u00ad\ndictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely\nbelieve in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor\ndisqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit\nwhere evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously\nresolving closer calls against the defendant rather than\ngiving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf. United States v.\nMcVeigh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448221\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448221/united-states-v-mcveigh/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It includes an impairment\nof the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from\nevidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to some\u00ad\nthing not included in the evidence. That something has its\nmost powerful effect if it generates strong emotional re\u00ad\nsponses\u201d). In this regard, it is significant that the Gov\u00ad\nernment placed relatively little emphasis on the nine\ninsider trading counts during its closing argument, declin\u00ad\ning to explain its theory on those counts in any detail\nwhatsoever. Record 37010. The acquittals on those\ncounts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of\nprejudice.\n                        *     *     *\n  In sum, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that\nvoir dire gave the District Court \u201ca sturdy foundation to\nassess fitness for jury service.\u201d Cf. ante, at 29. Taken\ntogether, the District Court\u2019s failure to cover certain vital\nsubjects, its superficial coverage of other topics, and its\nuncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave\nme doubtful that Skilling\u2019s jury was indeed free from the\ndeep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at\nlarge. \u201c[R]egardless of the heinousness of the crime\n40              SKILLING v.

Irvin, 366\nU. S., at 722. Because I do not believe Skilling\u2019s trial met\nthis standard, I would grant him relief.\n</pre>",
