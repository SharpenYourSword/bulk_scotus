HOLDER, ATTORNEY \n\n                   GENERAL\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u201360. Argued March 31, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nPetitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, faced de\n  portation after committing two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas.\n  For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received\n  20 days in jail. For the second, possession without a prescription of\n  one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days. Texas law, like federal\n  law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that\n  petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but\n  Texas did not seek such an enhancement here. After the second con\n  viction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings. Peti\n  tioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eli\n  gible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration\n  and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any\n  \u201caggravated felony,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3). Section 1101(a)(43)(B)\n  defines that term to include, inter alia, \u201cillicit trafficking in a con\n  trolled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c), which, in turn, defines a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d\n  as a \u201cfelony punishable under,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe Controlled Substances\n  Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).\u201d A felony is a crime for which the\n  \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\u201d is \u201cmore than one\n  year.\u201d \u00a73559(a). Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misde\n  meanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction \u201cafter a\n  prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State . . .\n  has become final\u201d\u2014a \u201crecidivist\u201d simple possession offense\u2014is \u201cpun\n  ishable\u201d as a \u201cfelony\u201d under \u00a7924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sen\n  tence. Only this \u201crecidivist\u201d simple possession category might be an\n  \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43). A prosecutor must\n  charge the existence of the prior conviction.           See 21 U. S. C.\n2                 CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    \u00a7851(a)(1). Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity,\n    \u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment\n    based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites\n    to \u201cauthorize\u201d a felony punishment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a), for the sim\n    ple possession offense at issue.\n       Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioner\u2019s second simple\n    possession conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that made him in\n    eligible for cancellation of removal. The Board of Immigration Ap\n    peals and Fifth Circuit affirmed. Relying on the holding in Lopez v.\n    Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 56\u2014that to be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for im\n    migration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable\n    as a felony under federal law\u2014the court used a \u201chypothetical ap\n    proach,\u201d concluding that because petitioner\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d could have\n    been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it\n    could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.\nHeld: Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggra\n vated felonies under \u00a71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state con\n viction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction. Pp. 9\u201319.\n    (a) Considering the disputed provisions\u2019 terms and their \u201ccommon\n sense conception,\u201d Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53, it would be counterintui\n tive and \u201cunorthodox\u201d to apply an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or \u201cillicit traf\n ficking\u201d label to petitioner\u2019s recidivist possession, see id., at 54. The\n same is true for his penalty. One does not usually think of a 10-day\n sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an\n \u201caggravated felony.\u201d This Court must be very wary in this case be\n cause the Government seeks a result that \u201cthe English language tells\n [the Court] not to expect.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (b) The Government\u2019s position\u2014that \u201cconduct punishable as a fel\n ony\u201d should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when\n the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal law\u2014\n is unpersuasive. First, it ignores the INA\u2019s text, which limits the At\n torney General\u2019s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a nonciti\n zen \u201chas . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n \u00a71229b(a)(3). Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not\n what might have or could have been charged. Under the Controlled\n Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sen\n tence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidi\n vist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend\n against that charge. Here, petitioner\u2019s record of conviction contains\n no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense. An immigration court\n cannot, ex post, enhance the state offense of record just because facts\n known to it would have authorized a greater penalty. The Govern\n ment contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court\n under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \u201caggra\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  vated felony\u201d for immigration law purposes. But his circumstances\n  were not identical to the Government\u2019s hypothesis. And the Govern\n  ment\u2019s approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3),\n  which requires an \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction\u2014not that the non\n  citizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.\n  Second, the Government\u2019s position fails to effectuate 21 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7851\u2019s mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great\n  practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are in\n  tegral to the structure and design of federal drug laws. They author\n  ize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pur\n  sue a recidivist enhancement. So do many state criminal codes,\n  including Texas\u2019. Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own\n  recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecu\n  tors\u2019 independent judgment to execute such laws. Third, the Fifth\n  Circuit misread Lopez. This Court never used a \u201chypothetical ap\n  proach\u201d in its analysis. By focusing on facts known to the immigra\n  tion court that could have but did not serve as the basis for the state\n  conviction and punishment, the Circuit\u2019s approach introduces a level\n  of conjecture that has no basis in Lopez. Fourth, the Government\u2019s\n  argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts,\n  for it is quite unlikely that petitioner\u2019s conduct would have been pun\n  ished as a felony in federal court. Finally, as the Court noted in Leo\n  cal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8, ambiguities in criminal statutes\n  referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti\n  zen\u2019s favor. Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has com\n  mitted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d is relevant to the type of relief he may\n  obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact remov\n  able. Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney\n  General\u2019s discretion.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo, a lawful\npermanent resident who has lived in the United States\nsince he was five years old, faced deportation under fed\neral law after he committed two misdemeanor drug pos\nsession offenses in Texas. For the first, possession of less\nthan two ounces of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.\nFor the second, possession without a prescription of one\ntablet of a common antianxiety medication, he received 10\ndays in jail. After this second offense, the Federal Gov\nernment initiated removal proceedings against him. He\nconceded that he was removable, but claimed he was\neligible for discretionary relief from removal under 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71229b(a).\n   To decide whether Carachuri-Rosendo is eligible to seek\ncancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility under\n\u00a71229b(a), we must decide whether he has been convicted\nof an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3), a category of\ncrimes singled out for the harshest deportation conse\nquences. The Court of Appeals held that a simple drug\npossession offense, committed after the conviction for a\n2                CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst possession offense became final, is always an aggra\nvated felony. We now reverse and hold that second or\nsubsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated\nfelonies under \u00a71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state\nconviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.\n                               I\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66\nStat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., a lawful\npermanent resident subject to removal from the United\nStates may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal\nif, inter alia, he \u201chas not been convicted of any aggravated\nfelony,\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3). The statutory definition of the term\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d includes a list of numerous federal\noffenses,1 one of which is \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled\nsubstance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as de\nfined in section 924(c) of title 18).\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). Sec\ntion 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to\nmean \u201cany felony punishable under,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe Con\ntrolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).\u201d A felony\nis a crime for which the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\nauthorized\u201d is \u201cmore than one year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a).2\n   The maze of statutory cross-references continues. Sec\ntion 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes\nsimple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in\nthis case. But it prescribes punishment for both misde\nmeanor and felony offenses. Except for simple possession\nof crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple\npossession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maxi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Theterm \u201caggravated felony\u201d \u201capplies to an offense . . . whether in\nviolation of Federal or State law\u201d (or, in certain circumstances, \u201cthe law\nof a foreign country\u201d). 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\n   2 The Controlled Substances Act itself defines the term \u201cfelony\u201d as\n\n\u201cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State\nlaw as a felony.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(13). The Government concedes that\nthe classification of felonies under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a) controls in this\ncase. Brief for Respondent 4.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmum term authorized for such a conviction is less than\none year. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a). However, a conviction for a\nsimple possession offense \u201cafter a prior conviction under\nthis subchapter [or] under the law of any State . . . has\nbecome final\u201d\u2014what we will call recidivist simple posses\nsion3\u2014may be punished as a felony, with a prison sen\ntence of up to two years. Ibid.4 Thus, except for simple\npossession offenses involving isolated categories of drugs\nnot presently at issue, only recidivist simple possession\noffenses are \u201cpunishable\u201d as a federal \u201cfelony\u201d under the\nControlled Substances Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2). And\nthus only a conviction within this particular category of\nsimple possession offenses might, conceivably, be an \u201cag\ngravated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43).\n   For a subsequent simple possession offense to be eligible\nfor an enhanced punishment, i.e., to be punishable as a\nfelony, the Controlled Substances Act requires that a\nprosecutor charge the existence of the prior simple posses\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Although    \u00a7844(a) does not expressly define a separate offense of\n\u201crecidivist simple possession,\u201d the fact of a prior conviction must none\ntheless be found before a defendant is subject to a felony sentence.\nTrue, the statutory scheme comports with Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), in which we explained that the\nConstitution does not require treating recidivism as an element of the\noffense. In other words, Congress has permissibly set out a criminal\noffense for simple possession whereby a recidivist finding by the judge,\nby a preponderance of the evidence, authorizes a punishment that\nexceeds the statutory maximum penalty for a simple possession offense.\nBut the fact of a prior conviction must still be found\u2014if only by a judge\nand if only by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014before a defendant is\nsubject to felony punishment. For present purposes, we therefore view\n\u00a7844(a)\u2019s felony simple possession provision as separate and distinct\nfrom the misdemeanor simple possession offense that section also\nprescribes.\n   4 The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates this\n\nsubsection may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more\nthan 1 year . . . except that if he commits such offense after a prior\nconviction . . . he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not\nless than 15 days but not more than 2 years . . . .\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a).\n4                CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsion conviction before trial, or before a guilty plea. See 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7851(a)(1).5 Notice, plus an opportunity to chal\nlenge the validity of the prior conviction used to enhance\nthe current conviction, \u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c), are mandatory pre\nrequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of a\nprior conviction.6 And they are also necessary prerequi\nsites under federal law to \u201cauthorize\u201d a felony punish\nment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a), for the type of simple posses\nsion offense at issue in this case.\n   Neither the definition of an \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d offense\nunder 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) nor that of a \u201cdrug traf\nficking crime\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) describes or\nreferences any state offenses. The \u201caggravated felony\u201d\ndefinition does explain that the term applies \u201cto an offense\ndescribed in this paragraph whether in violation of Fed\neral or State law.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43). But in Lopez v. Gonzales,\n549 U. S. 47, 56 (2006), we determined that, in order to be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This subsection provides: \u201cNo person who stands convicted of an\n\noffense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by\nreason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before\nentry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information\nwith the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or\ncounsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be\nrelied upon.\u201d \u00a7851(a)(1).\n  6 We have previously recognized the mandatory nature of these re\n\nquirements, as have the courts of appeals. See United States v. La-\nBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 754, n. 1 (1997) (\u201cWe note that imposition of an\nenhanced penalty [for recidivism] is not automatic. . . . If the Govern\nment does not file such notice [under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851(a)(1)] . . . the\nlower sentencing range will be applied even though the defendant may\notherwise be eligible for the increased penalty\u201d); see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Beasley, 495 F. 3d 142, 148 (CA4 2007); United States v.\nCeballos, 302 F. 3d 679, 690\u2013692 (CA7 2002); United States v. Dodson,\n288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002); United States v. Mooring, 287 F. 3d 725,\n727\u2013728 (CA8 2002). Although \u00a7851\u2019s procedural safeguards are not\nconstitutionally compelled, see Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 247,\nthey are nevertheless a mandatory feature of the Controlled Substances\nAct and a prerequisite to securing a felony conviction under \u00a7844(a) for\na successive simple possession offense.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan \u201caggravated felony\u201d for immigration law purposes, a\nstate drug conviction must be punishable as a felony\nunder federal law. We held that \u201ca state offense consti\ntutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Sub\nstances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a\nfelony under that federal law.\u201d Id., at 60. Despite the fact\nthat the Lopez petitioner had been punished as a felon\nunder state law\u2014and, indeed, received a 5-year sen\ntence\u2014the conduct of his offense was not punishable as a\nfelony under federal law, and this prevented the state\nconviction from qualifying as an aggravated felony for\nimmigration law purposes. Id., at 55 (\u201cUnless a state\noffense is punishable as a federal felony it does not\ncount\u201d).\n   In the case before us, the Government argues that Cara\nchuri-Rosendo, despite having received only a 10-day\nsentence for his Texas misdemeanor simple possession\noffense, nevertheless has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d within the meaning of the INA. This is so,\nthe Government contends, because had Carachuri-\nRosendo been prosecuted in federal court instead of state\ncourt, he could have been prosecuted as a felon and re\nceived a 2-year sentence based on the fact of his prior\nsimple possession offense. Our holding in Lopez teaches\nthat, for a state conviction to qualify as an \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201d under the INA, it is necessary for the underlying\nconduct to be punishable as a federal felony. Id., at 60.\nWe now must determine whether the mere possibility, no\nmatter how remote, that a 2-year sentence might have\nbeen imposed in a federal trial is a sufficient basis for\nconcluding that a state misdemeanant who was not\ncharged as a recidivist has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71229b(a)(3).\n                         II\n  Carachuri-Rosendo was born in Mexico in 1978.          He\n6               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncame to the United States with his parents in 1983 and\nhas been a lawful permanent resident of Texas ever since.\nHis common-law wife and four children are American\ncitizens, as are his mother and two sisters.\n   Like so many in this country, Carachuri-Rosendo has\ngotten into some trouble with our drug laws. In 2004, he\npleaded guilty to possessing less than two ounces of mari\njuana, a Class B misdemeanor, and was sentenced to\nconfinement for 20 days by a Texas court. See App. 19a\u2013\n22a; Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7481.121(a) and\n(b)(1) (West 2003). In 2005, he pleaded nolo contendere to\npossessing less than 28 grams\u2014one tablet\u2014of alprazolam\n(known commercially as Xanax) without a prescription, a\nClass A misdemeanor. See App. 31a\u201334a; Tex. Health &\nSafety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7481.117(a) and (b). Although Texas\nlaw, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhance\nment if the prosecutor proved that Carachuri-Rosendo had\nbeen previously convicted of an offense of a similar class,\nthe State did not elect to seek an enhancement based on\nhis criminal history. App. 32a.\n   In 2006, on the basis of Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s second\npossession offense, the Federal Government initiated\nremoval proceedings against him. Appearing pro se before\nthe Immigration Judge, Carachuri-Rosendo did not dis\npute that his conviction for possessing one tablet of Xanax\nwithout a prescription made him removable,7 but he ap\nplied for a discretionary cancellation of removal pursuant\nto 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a). Under that statutory provision,\nthe Attorney General may cancel an order of removal or\nan order of inadmissibility so long as, inter alia, the non\ncitizen \u201chas not been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(a)(3). The Immigration Judge held that peti\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 But for trivial marijuana possession offenses (such as Carachuri-\n\nRosendo\u2019s 2004 state offense), virtually all drug offenses are grounds\nfor removal under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntioner\u2019s second simple possession conviction was an \u201cag\ngravated felony\u201d that made him ineligible for cancellation\nof removal.\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) followed Cir\ncuit precedent and affirmed that decision, but it disagreed\nwith the Immigration Judge\u2019s legal analysis. In its en\nbanc opinion, the BIA ruled that in cases arising in Cir\ncuits in which the question had not yet been decided, the\nBIA would not treat a second or successive misdemeanor\nconviction as an aggravated felony unless the conviction\ncontained a finding that the offender was a recidivist.\nIn re Carachuri-Rosendo, 24 I. & N. Dec. 382, 387, 391\n(2007).\n   The BIA explained that the statutory question is com\nplicated by the fact that \u201c \u2018recidivist possession\u2019 \u201d is not a\n\u201cdiscrete offense under Federal law.\u201d Id., at 388. While\nmost federal offenses are defined by elements that must be\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, recidivist\npossession is an \u201camalgam of elements, substantive sen\ntencing factors, and procedural safeguards.\u201d Id., at 389.\nSection 844(a) defines simple possession by reference to\nstatutory elements, but \u201cfacts leading to recidivist felony\npunishment, such as the existence of a prior conviction, do\nnot qualify as \u2018elements\u2019 in the traditional sense.\u201d Ibid.\n   The BIA observed, however, that \u201c21 U. S. C. \u00a7851\nprecludes a Federal judge from enhancing a drug of\nfender\u2019s sentence on the basis of recidivism absent compli\nance with a number of safeguards that, among other\nthings, serve to protect the right of the accused to notice\nand an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of an\nincreased punishment based on prior convictions.\u201d Ibid.\nTherefore, these requirements \u201care part and parcel of\nwhat it means for a crime to be a \u2018recidivist\u2019 offense.\u201d Id.,\nat 391. \u201c[U]nless the State successfully sought to impose\npunishment for a recidivist drug conviction,\u201d the BIA\nconcluded, a state simple possession \u201cconviction cannot\n8               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2018proscribe conduct punishable as\u2019 recidivist possession\u201d\nunder federal law. Ibid.\n   On review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the BIA\u2019s\ndecision in Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s case, reading our decision\nin Lopez as dictating its outcome. \u201c[I]f the conduct pro\nscribed by the state offense could have been prosecuted as\na felony\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act, the court\nreasoned, then the defendant\u2019s conviction qualifies as an\naggravated felony. 570 F. 3d 263, 267 (CA5 2009) (citing\nLopez, 549 U. S., at 60). The court deemed its analysis\n\u201cthe hypothetical approach,\u201d a term it derived from its\nunderstanding of our method of analysis in Lopez. 570\nF. 3d, at 266, and n. 3; see also United States v. Pacheco-\nDiaz, 513 F. 3d 776, 779 (CA7 2008) (per curiam) (employ\ning the \u201chypothetical-federal-felony approach\u201d). Under\nthis approach, as the Court of Appeals understood it,\ncourts \u201cg[o] beyond the state statute\u2019s elements to look at\nthe hypothetical conduct a state statute proscribes.\u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 266, n. 3. Accordingly, any \u201cconduct\u201d that \u201chypo\nthetically\u201d \u201ccould have been punished as a felony\u201d \u201chad [it]\nbeen prosecuted in federal court\u201d is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nfor federal immigration law purposes. Id., at 265. In\napplying this hypothetical approach, the Court of Appeals\ndid not discuss the \u00a7851 procedural requirements. In\nstead, it concluded that because Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s\n\u201cconduct\u201d could have been prosecuted as simple possession\nwith a recidivist enhancement under state law\u2014even\nthough it was not\u2014it could have also been punished as a\nfelony under federal law. Thus, in the Court of Appeals\u2019\nview, his conviction for simple possession under state law,\nwithout a recidivist enhancement, was an \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201d for immigration law purposes.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Since the Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, Cara\n\nchuri-Rosendo has been removed.

S. ____\n(2009).\n                               III\n   When interpreting the statutory provisions under dis\npute, we begin by looking at the terms of the provisions\nand the \u201ccommonsense conception\u201d of those terms. Lopez,\n549 U. S., at 53. Carachuri-Rosendo is ineligible for can\ncellation of removal only if he was \u201cconvicted of a[n] ag\ngravated felony,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a), which, in this case,\ncould only be a conviction for \u201cillicit trafficking in a con\ntrolled substance . . . . including a drug trafficking crime,\u201d\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B).\n   A recidivist possession offense such as Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s does not fit easily into the \u201ceveryday under\nstanding\u201d of those terms, Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53. This\ntype of petty simple possession offense is not typically\nthought of as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or as \u201cillicit traffick\ning.\u201d We explained in Lopez that \u201cordinarily \u2018trafficking\u2019\nmeans some sort of commercial dealing.\u201d Id., at 53\u201354\n(citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004)). And\njust as in Lopez, \u201c[c]ommerce . . . was no part of\u201d Cara\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRosendo was not convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and if he contin\nues to satisfy the requirements of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a), he may still seek\ncancellation of removal even after having been removed. See \u00a71229b(a)\n(\u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who\nis inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u201d meets\nseveral criteria).\n   9 Compare 570 F. 3d 263 (CA5 2009) (holding state conviction for\n\nsimple possession after prior conviction for simple possession is a felony\nunder the Controlled Substances Act and thus an aggravated felony),\nand Fernandez v. Mukasey, 544 F. 3d 862 (CA7 2008) (same), with\nBerhe v. Gonzales, 464 F. 3d 74 (CA1 2006) (taking contrary view),\nAlsol v. Mukasey, 548 F. 3d 207 (CA2 2008) (same), Gerbier v. Holmes,\n280 F. 3d 297 (CA3 2002) (same), and Rashid v. Mukasey, 531 F. 3d 438\n(CA6 2008) (same).\n10           CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchuri-Rosendo\u2019s possessing a single tablet of Xanax, \u201cand\ncertainly it is no element of simple possession.\u201d 549 U. S.,\nat 54. As an initial matter, then, we observe that a read\ning of this statutory scheme that would apply an \u201caggra\nvated\u201d or \u201ctrafficking\u201d label to any simple possession of\nfense is, to say the least, counterintuitive and\n\u201cunorthodox,\u201d ibid.\n  The same is true for the type of penalty at issue. We do\nnot usually think of a 10-day sentence for the unauthor\nized possession of a trivial amount of a prescription drug\nas an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d A \u201cfelony,\u201d we have come to\nunderstand, is a \u201cserious crime usu[ally] punishable by\nimprisonment for more than one year or by death.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nBlack\u2019s). An \u201caggravated\u201d offense is one \u201cmade worse or\nmore serious by circumstances such as violence, the pres\nence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another\ncrime.\u201d Id., at 75. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is unique\nto Title 8, which covers immigration matters; it is not a\nterm used elsewhere within the United States Code. Our\nstatutory criminal law classifies the most insignificant of\nfederal felonies\u2014\u201cClass E\u201d felonies\u2014as carrying a sen\ntence of \u201cless than five years but more than one year.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73559(a)(5). While it is true that a defendant\u2019s\ncriminal history might be seen to make an offense \u201cworse\u201d\nby virtue thereof, Black\u2019s 75, it is nevertheless unorthodox\nto classify this type of petty simple possession recidivism\nas an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d\n  Of course, as Justice Souter observed in his opinion for\nthe Court in Lopez, Congress, like \u201cHumpty Dumpty,\u201d has\nthe power to give words unorthodox meanings. 549 U. S.,\nat 54. But in this case the Government argues for a result\nthat \u201cthe English language tells us not to expect,\u201d so we\nmust be \u201cvery wary of the Government\u2019s position.\u201d Ibid.\nBecause the English language tells us that most aggra\nvated felonies are punishable by sentences far longer than\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n10 days, and that mere possession of one tablet of Xanax\ndoes not constitute \u201ctrafficking,\u201d Lopez instructs us to be\ndoubly wary of the Government\u2019s position in this case.10\n                              IV\n   The Government\u2019s position, like the Court of Appeals\u2019\n\u201chypothetical approach,\u201d would treat all \u201cconduct punish\nable as a felony\u201d as the equivalent of a \u201cconviction\u201d of a\nfelony whenever, hypothetically speaking, the underlying\nconduct could have received felony treatment under fed\neral law. We find this reasoning\u2014and the \u201chypothetical\napproach\u201d itself\u2014unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n   First, and most fundamentally, the Government\u2019s posi\ntion ignores the text of the INA, which limits the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a\nnoncitizen \u201chas . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated\nfelony.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3) (emphasis added). The\ntext thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction\nitself as our starting place, not to what might have or\ncould have been charged. And to be convicted of an aggra\nvated felony punishable as such under the Controlled\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The Court stated in Lopez that \u201crecidivist possession, see 21\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7844(a), clearly fall[s] within the definitions used by Congress\nin 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) and 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2), regardless of\nwhether these federal possession felonies or their state counterparts\nconstitute \u2018illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u2019 or \u2018drug traffick\ning\u2019 as those terms are used in ordinary speech.\u201d 549 U. S., at 55, n. 6.\nOur decision today is not in conflict with this footnote; it is still true\nthat recidivist simple possession offenses charged and prosecuted as\nsuch \u201cclearly fall\u201d within the definition of an aggravated felony. What\nwe had no occasion to decide in Lopez, and what we now address, is\nwhat it means to be convicted of an aggravated felony. Lopez teaches\nus that it is necessary that the conduct punished under state law\ncorrespond to a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\nto be an aggravated felony under \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But it does not\ninstruct as to whether the mere possibility that conduct could be\u2014but\nis not\u2014charged as an offense punishable as a felony under federal law\nis sufficient.\n12               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nSubstances Act, the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\nauthorized\u201d must be \u201cmore than one year,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73559(a)(5). Congress, recall, chose to authorize only a 1\nyear sentence for nearly all simple possession offenses, but\nit created a narrow exception for those cases in which a\nprosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist\nand the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to\ndefend against that charge. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851; Part I,\nsupra.\n   Indisputably, Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s record of conviction\ncontains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.\nCarachuri-Rosendo argues that even such a finding would\nbe insufficient, and that a prosecutorial charge of recidi\nvism and an opportunity to defend against that charge\nalso would be required before he could be deemed \u201ccon\nvicted\u201d of a felony punishable under the Controlled Sub\nstances Act. In the absence of any finding of recidivism,\nwe need not, and do not, decide whether these additional\nprocedures would be necessary. Although a federal immi\ngration court may have the power to make a recidivist\nfinding in the first instance, see, e.g., Almendarez-Torres\nv. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), it cannot,\nex post, enhance the state offense of record just because\nfacts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty\nunder either state or federal law.11 Carachuri-Rosendo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Our decision last Term in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009),\n\nalso relied upon by the Government, is not to the contrary. In that\ncase, we rejected the so-called categorical approach employed in cases\nlike United States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), when assessing\nwhether, under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i), a noncitizen has commit\nted \u201can offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n. . . victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d Our analysis was tailored to the \u201ccircum\nstance-specific\u201d language contained in that particular subsection of the\naggravated felony definition. Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). And we specifically distinguished the \u201cgeneric\u201d categories of aggra\nvated felonies for which a categorical approach might be appropriate\u2014\nincluding the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d provision\u2014from the \u201ccircumstance\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a7844(a) under identical circumstances,\nhe would have committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for im\nmigration law purposes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\u201337. This is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nspecific\u201d offense at hand. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137, 8). Moreover,\nunlike the instant case, there was no debate in Nijhawan over whether\nthe petitioner actually had been \u201cconvicted\u201d of fraud; we only consid\nered how to calculate the amount of loss once a conviction for a particu\nlar category of aggravated felony has occurred.\n   12 Linking our inquiry to the record of conviction comports with how\n\nwe have categorized convictions for state offenses within the definition\nof generic federal criminal sanctions under the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e). The United States urges that our\ndecision in Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, an ACCA case, supports its\nposition in this case. Brief for Respondent 29\u201330. To the extent that\nRodriquez is relevant to the issue at hand, we think the contrary is\ntrue. In that decision we considered whether a recidivist finding under\nstate law that had the effect of increasing the \u201cmaximum term of\nimprisonment\u201d to 10 years, irrespective of the actual sentence imposed,\nmade the offense a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d within the meaning of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1) and therefore an ACCA predicate offense. 553 U. S.,\nat 382. We held that a recidivist finding could set the \u201cmaximum term\nof imprisonment,\u201d but only when the finding is a part of the record of\nconviction. Id., at 389. Indeed, we specifically observed that \u201cin those\ncases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show\nthat the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it\nmay well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing\nthat a conviction was for a qualifying offense.\u201d Ibid. In other words,\nwhen the recidivist finding giving rise to a 10-year sentence is not\napparent from the sentence itself, or appears neither as part of the\n\u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d nor the \u201cformal charging document,\u201d ibid., the\nGovernment will not have established that the defendant had a prior\nconviction for which the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years\nor more (assuming the recidivist finding is a necessary precursor to\nsuch a sentence).\n14           CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso, the Government suggests, because the only statutory\ntext that matters is the word \u201cpunishable\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(2): Whatever conduct might be \u201cpunishable\u201d as a\nfelony, regardless of whether it actually is so punished or\nnot, is a felony for immigration law purposes. But for the\nreasons just stated, the circumstances of Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s prosecution were not identical to those hypothe\nsized by the Government. And the Government\u2019s ab\nstracted approach to \u00a7924(c)(2) cannot be reconciled with\nthe more concrete guidance of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3),\nwhich limits the Attorney General\u2019s cancellation authority\nonly when the noncitizen has actually been \u201cconvicted of\na[n] aggravated felony\u201d\u2014not when he merely could have\nbeen convicted of a felony but was not.\n   Second, and relatedly, the Government\u2019s position fails to\ngive effect to the mandatory notice and process require\nments contained in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851. For federal law\npurposes, a simple possession offense is not \u201cpunishable\u201d\nas a felony unless a federal prosecutor first elects to\ncharge a defendant as a recidivist in the criminal informa\ntion. The statute, as described in Part I, supra, at 3\u20134,\nspeaks in mandatory terms, permitting \u201c[n]o person\u201d to be\nsubject to a recidivist enhancement\u2014and therefore, in this\ncase, a felony sentence\u2014\u201cunless\u201d he has been given notice\nof the Government\u2019s intent to prove the fact of a prior\nconviction. Federal law also gives the defendant an oppor\ntunity to challenge the fact of the prior conviction itself.\n\u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c). The Government would dismiss these proce\ndures as meaningless, so long as they may be satisfied\nduring the immigration proceeding.\n   But these procedural requirements have great practical\nsignificance with respect to the conviction itself and are\nintegral to the structure and design of our drug laws.\nThey authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when\nelecting whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.

S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cWhereas the prior version of [\u00a7851(a)] made enhance\nments for prior offenses mandatory, the new statutory\nscheme gave prosecutors discretion whether to seek en\nhancements based on prior convictions\u201d). Because the\nprocedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence,\n\u00a7851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek\na conviction that is \u201cpunishable\u201d as a felony under \u00a7844(a).\nUnderscoring the significance of the \u00a7851 procedures,\nthe United States Attorney\u2019s Manual places decisions\nwith respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on\npar with the filing of a criminal charge against a\ndefendant. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attor-\nneys\u2019 Manual \u00a79\u201327.300(B) comment. (1997), online\nat    http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/\nusam/title9/27mcrm.htm#9-27.300 (as visited June 3,\n2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). (\u201cEvery\nprosecutor should regard the filing of an information\nunder 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851 . . . as equivalent to the filing of\ncharges\u201d).\n   Many state criminal codes, like the federal scheme,\nafford similar deference to prosecutorial discretion when\nprescribing recidivist enhancements. Texas is one such\nState. See, e.g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712.42, 12.43\n(West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available \u201c[i]f it is\nshown on the trial\u201d that defendant was previously con\nvicted of identified categories of felonies and misdemean\nors). And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected\nto \u201c[a]bandon\u201d a recidivist enhancement under state law.\nApp. 32a (reproducing state judgment). Were we to permit\na federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist\nenhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen\u2019s\noffense \u201cpunishable\u201d as a felony for immigration law pur\nposes, we would denigrate the independent judgment of\nstate prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.\n   Third, the Court of Appeals\u2019 hypothetical felony ap\nproach is based on a misreading of our decision in Lopez.\n16            CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nWe never used the term \u201chypothetical\u201d to describe our\nanalysis in that case. We did look to the \u201cproscribe[d]\nconduct\u201d of a state offense to determine whether it is\n\u201cpunishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d 549 U. S.,\nat 60. But the \u201chypothetical approach\u201d employed by the\nCourt of Appeals introduces a level of conjecture at the\noutset of this inquiry that has no basis in Lopez. It ig\nnores both the conviction (the relevant statutory hook),\nand the conduct actually punished by the state offense.\nInstead, it focuses on facts known to the immigration court\nthat could have but did not serve as the basis for the state\nconviction and punishment. As the Sixth Circuit has\nexplained, this approach is really a \u201c \u2018hypothetical to a\nhypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Rashid v. Mukasey, 531 F. 3d 438, 445\n(2008). Not only does the Government wish us to consider\na fictional federal felony\u2014whether the crime for which\nCarachuri-Rosendo was actually convicted would be a\nfelony under the Controlled Substances Act\u2014but the\nGovernment also wants us to consider facts not at issue in\nthe crime of conviction (i.e., the existence of a prior convic\ntion) to determine whether Carachuri-Rosendo could have\nbeen charged with a federal felony. This methodology is\nfar removed from the more focused, categorical inquiry\nemployed in Lopez.\n   Fourth, it seems clear that the Government\u2019s argument\nis inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts.\nIt is quite unlikely that the \u201cconduct\u201d that gave rise to\nCarachuri-Rosendo\u2019s conviction would have been punished\nas a felony in federal court. Under the United States\nSentencing Guidelines, Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s recom\nmended sentence, based on the type of controlled sub\nstance at issue, would not have exceeded one year and\nvery likely would have been less than 6 months. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n\u00a72D2.1(a)(3) (Nov. 2009) (base offense level of 4). And as\nwas true in Lopez, the Government has provided us with\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nno empirical data suggesting that \u201ceven a single eager\nAssistant United States Attorney\u201d has ever sought to\nprosecute a comparable federal defendant as a felon. 549\nU. S., at 57\u201358. The Government\u2019s \u201chypothetical\u201d ap\nproach to this case is therefore misleading as well as\nspeculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s federal-court\ncounterpart would not, in actuality, have faced any felony\ncharge.\n   Finally, as we noted in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1,\n11, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced\nin immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti\nzen\u2019s favor. And here the critical language appears in a\ncriminal statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2).\n   We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d is relevant, inter alia, to the type of\nrelief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to\nwhether he is in fact removable. In other words, to the\nextent that our rejection of the Government\u2019s broad un\nderstanding of the scope of \u201caggravated felony\u201d may have\nany practical effect on policing our Nation\u2019s borders, it is a\nlimited one. Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his posi\ntion, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby\navoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal. But\nhe will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in\nthe first instance, removable. Any relief he may obtain\ndepends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.\n                         *      *    *\n  In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA, the conduct prohibited\nby state law must be punishable as a felony under federal\nlaw. See Lopez, 549 U. S., at 60. But as the text and\nstructure of the relevant statutory provisions demon\nstrate, the defendant must also have been actually con\nvicted of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under\nfederal law. The mere possibility that the defendant\u2019s\n18            CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of convic\ntion, could have authorized a felony conviction under\nfederal law is insufficient to satisfy the statutory com\nmand that a noncitizen be \u201cconvicted of a[n] aggravated\nfelony\u201d before he loses the opportunity to seek cancellation\nof removal. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3). The Court of Appeals,\nas well as the Government, made the logical error of as\nsuming that a necessary component of an aggravated\nfelony is also sufficient to satisfy its statutory definition.\n                            V\n  We hold that when a defendant has been convicted of a\nsimple possession offense that has not been enhanced\nbased on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been\n\u201cconvicted\u201d under \u00a71229b(a)(3) of a \u201cfelony punishable\u201d as\nsuch \u201cunder the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(2). The prosecutor in Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s case\ndeclined to charge him as a recidivist. He has, therefore,\nnot been convicted of a felony punishable under the Con\ntrolled Substances Act.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s 2005\nconviction for simple possession of a tablet of Xanax in\nviolation of Texas law is not a conviction for an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But my\nreasoning is more straightforward than the Court\u2019s, and so\nI concur only in the judgment.\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attor\nney General may cancel the removal of an alien from the\nUnited States provided the alien \u201chas not been convicted\nof any aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3). There is no\nstatutory definition of \u201cconvicted,\u201d but a \u201cconviction\u201d is\ndefined to mean a \u201cformal judgment of guilt of the alien\nentered by a court.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(48)(A). The term \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d includes, among many other offenses, \u201ca\ndrug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)]).\u201d\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B). A \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d is in turn\ndefined as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2).\n   It could be concluded from the provisions discussed\nabove that only a federal conviction for a felony offense\nunder the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But the penultimate sentence\nin \u00a71101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d \u201capplies to an offense described in this\n2             CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nparagraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\u201d\nThis language, we have said, confirms that \u201ca state offense\nwhose elements include the elements of a felony punish\nable under the [Controlled Substances Act] is an aggra\nvated felony.\u201d Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 57 (2006).\n   The conceptual problem in the present case is that the\nonly crime defined by 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a) of the Controlled\nSubstances Act, simple possession of prohibited drugs, is a\nmisdemeanor.       That misdemeanor becomes a \u201cfelony\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d only\nbecause the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes\nadditional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a\nfelony. We held in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n523 U. S. 224 (1998), that recidivism can constitutionally\nbe made a sentencing factor rather than an element of the\ncrime, despite the fact that it is used to increase the al\nlowable sentence. And we said in Lopez that a \u201cstate\npossession crim[e] that correspond[s] to\u201d the \u201cfelony viola\ntio[n]\u201d of \u201crecidivist possession\u201d in \u00a7844(a) \u201cclearly fall[s]\nwithin the definitions used by Congress . . . in\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B) and . . . \u00a7924(c)(2).\u201d 549 U. S., at 55, n. 6.\n   But to say all that is not to say that an alien has been\n\u201cconvicted of\u201d an aggravated felony (which is what\n\u00a71229b(a)(3) requires) when he has been convicted of\nnothing more than a second state misdemeanor violation,\nthe punishment for which could, because of recidivism, be\nextended beyond one year. Just because, by reason of\nAlmendarez-Torres, the federal misdemeanor offense has\nbeen raised to a felony offense without changing its ele\nments, solely by increasing its penalty pursuant to a\nrecidivist \u201csentencing factor\u201d; it does not follow that when\nthe question is asked whether someone has been \u201ccon\nvicted of\u201d a state offense that \u201ccorresponds\u201d to the federal\nmisdemeanor-become-felony, the answer can be sought in\nsentencing factors. A defendant is not \u201cconvicted\u201d of sen\ntencing factors, but only of the elements of the crime\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncharged in the indictment. In other words, a misdemeanor\noffense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment\nto the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the\nelements of a \u201cfelony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act\u201d; but does not qualify for purposes of de\ntermining what elements the alien has been \u201cconvicted of.\u201d\n  Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only \u201cconvicted of\u201d the\ncrime of knowing possession of a controlled substance\nwithout a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor\nunder Texas law. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009). Since the ele\nments of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime\nof his conviction did not \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the Controlled\nSubstances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under\n21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a).\n  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) identifies two\nrequirements that must be satisfied for Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s state conviction to qualify as a \u201c \u2018drug trafficking\ncrime\u2019 \u201d that renders him ineligible for cancellation of\nremoval:* \u201cFirst, the offense must be a felony; second, the\noffense must be capable of punishment under the Con\ntrolled Substances Act (CSA).\u201d Lopez v. Gonzales, 549\nU. S. 47, 61 (2006) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s offense of simple possession was \u201cpunishable\nunder the [CSA],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(2), and thus satisfied the second\nrequirement, but his crime of conviction in state court was\nonly a misdemeanor. Accordingly, that offense does not\nbar him from obtaining cancellation of removal.\n  The Fifth Circuit understandably felt constrained by\nthis Court\u2019s decision in Lopez to rule otherwise. In Lopez,\nthis Court held that \u201ca state offense constitutes a \u2018felony\npunishable under the [CSA]\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See 8 U. S.

Though Lopez addressed a felony\nconviction under state law that did not correlate to a\nfelony under the CSA, the Court\u2019s rule preordained the\nresult in this case:\n    \u201c[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject an\n    alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to\n    deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony\n    under the CSA. Accordingly, even if never convicted\n    of an actual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligi\n    ble for deportation based on a hypothetical federal\n    prosecution.\u201d Id., at 67 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  Today, the Court engages in jurisprudential gymnastics\nto avoid Lopez. I will not contort the law to fit the case.\nLopez was wrongly decided. But because a proper reading\nof the statutory text, see id., at 60\u201363, supports the result\nthe Court reaches today, I concur in the judgment.\n",

Argued March 31, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nPetitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, faced de\n  portation after committing two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas.\n  For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received\n  20 days in jail. For the second, possession without a prescription of\n  one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days. Texas law, like federal\n  law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that\n  petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but\n  Texas did not seek such an enhancement here. After the second con\n  viction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings. Peti\n  tioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eli\n  gible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration\n  and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any\n  \u201caggravated felony,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3). Section 1101(a)(43)(B)\n  defines that term to include, inter alia, \u201cillicit trafficking in a con\n  trolled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c), which, in turn, defines a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d\n  as a \u201cfelony punishable under,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe Controlled Substances\n  Act (21 U. S.

Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misde\n  meanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction \u201cafter a\n  prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State . . .\n  has become final\u201d\u2014a \u201crecidivist\u201d simple possession offense\u2014is \u201cpun\n  ishable\u201d as a \u201cfelony\u201d under \u00a7924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sen\n  tence. Only this \u201crecidivist\u201d simple possession category might be an\n  \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43). A prosecutor must\n  charge the existence of the prior conviction.           See 21 U. S. C.\n2                 CARACHURI-ROSENDO v.

Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity,\n    \u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment\n    based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites\n    to \u201cauthorize\u201d a felony punishment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a), for the sim\n    ple possession offense at issue.\n       Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioner\u2019s second simple\n    possession conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that made him in\n    eligible for cancellation of removal. The Board of Immigration Ap\n    peals and Fifth Circuit affirmed. Relying on the holding in Lopez v.\n    Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 56\u2014that to be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for im\n    migration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable\n    as a felony under federal law\u2014the court used a \u201chypothetical ap\n    proach,\u201d concluding that because petitioner\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d could have\n    been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it\n    could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.\nHeld: Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggra\n vated felonies under \u00a71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state con\n viction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction. Pp. 9\u201319.\n    (a) Considering the disputed provisions\u2019 terms and their \u201ccommon\n sense conception,\u201d Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53, it would be counterintui\n tive and \u201cunorthodox\u201d to apply an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or \u201cillicit traf\n ficking\u201d label to petitioner\u2019s recidivist possession, see id., at 54. The\n same is true for his penalty. One does not usually think of a 10-day\n sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an\n \u201caggravated felony.\u201d This Court must be very wary in this case be\n cause the Government seeks a result that \u201cthe English language tells\n [the Court] not to expect.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (b) The Government\u2019s position\u2014that \u201cconduct punishable as a fel\n ony\u201d should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when\n the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal law\u2014\n is unpersuasive. First, it ignores the INA\u2019s text, which limits the At\n torney General\u2019s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a nonciti\n zen \u201chas . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n \u00a71229b(a)(3). Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not\n what might have or could have been charged. Under the Controlled\n Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sen\n tence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidi\n vist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend\n against that charge. Here, petitioner\u2019s record of conviction contains\n no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense. An immigration court\n cannot, ex post, enhance the state offense of record just because facts\n known to it would have authorized a greater penalty. The Govern\n ment contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court\n under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \u201caggra\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  vated felony\u201d for immigration law purposes. But his circumstances\n  were not identical to the Government\u2019s hypothesis. And the Govern\n  ment\u2019s approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3),\n  which requires an \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction\u2014not that the non\n  citizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.\n  Second, the Government\u2019s position fails to effectuate 21 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7851\u2019s mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great\n  practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are in\n  tegral to the structure and design of federal drug laws. They author\n  ize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pur\n  sue a recidivist enhancement. So do many state criminal codes,\n  including Texas\u2019. Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own\n  recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecu\n  tors\u2019 independent judgment to execute such laws. Third, the Fifth\n  Circuit misread Lopez. This Court never used a \u201chypothetical ap\n  proach\u201d in its analysis. By focusing on facts known to the immigra\n  tion court that could have but did not serve as the basis for the state\n  conviction and punishment, the Circuit\u2019s approach introduces a level\n  of conjecture that has no basis in Lopez. Fourth, the Government\u2019s\n  argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts,\n  for it is quite unlikely that petitioner\u2019s conduct would have been pun\n  ished as a felony in federal court. Finally, as the Court noted in Leo\n  cal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8, ambiguities in criminal statutes\n  referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti\n  zen\u2019s favor. Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has com\n  mitted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d is relevant to the type of relief he may\n  obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact remov\n  able. Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney\n  General\u2019s discretion.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo, a lawful\npermanent resident who has lived in the United States\nsince he was five years old, faced deportation under fed\neral law after he committed two misdemeanor drug pos\nsession offenses in Texas. For the first, possession of less\nthan two ounces of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.\nFor the second, possession without a prescription of one\ntablet of a common antianxiety medication, he received 10\ndays in jail. After this second offense, the Federal Gov\nernment initiated removal proceedings against him. He\nconceded that he was removable, but claimed he was\neligible for discretionary relief from removal under 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71229b(a).\n   To decide whether Carachuri-Rosendo is eligible to seek\ncancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility under\n\u00a71229b(a), we must decide whether he has been convicted\nof an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3), a category of\ncrimes singled out for the harshest deportation conse\nquences. The Court of Appeals held that a simple drug\npossession offense, committed after the conviction for a\n2                CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst possession offense became final, is always an aggra\nvated felony. We now reverse and hold that second or\nsubsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated\nfelonies under \u00a71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state\nconviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.\n                               I\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66\nStat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., a lawful\npermanent resident subject to removal from the United\nStates may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal\nif, inter alia, he \u201chas not been convicted of any aggravated\nfelony,\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3). The statutory definition of the term\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d includes a list of numerous federal\noffenses,1 one of which is \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled\nsubstance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as de\nfined in section 924(c) of title 18).\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). Sec\ntion 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to\nmean \u201cany felony punishable under,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe Con\ntrolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 801 et seq.).\u201d A felony\nis a crime for which the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\nauthorized\u201d is \u201cmore than one year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a).2\n   The maze of statutory cross-references continues. Sec\ntion 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes\nsimple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in\nthis case. But it prescribes punishment for both misde\nmeanor and felony offenses. Except for simple possession\nof crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple\npossession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maxi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Theterm \u201caggravated felony\u201d \u201capplies to an offense . . . whether in\nviolation of Federal or State law\u201d (or, in certain circumstances, \u201cthe law\nof a foreign country\u201d). 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\n   2 The Controlled Substances Act itself defines the term \u201cfelony\u201d as\n\n\u201cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State\nlaw as a felony.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(13). The Government concedes that\nthe classification of felonies under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a) controls in this\ncase. Brief for Respondent 4.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmum term authorized for such a conviction is less than\none year. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a). However, a conviction for a\nsimple possession offense \u201cafter a prior conviction under\nthis subchapter [or] under the law of any State . . . has\nbecome final\u201d\u2014what we will call recidivist simple posses\nsion3\u2014may be punished as a felony, with a prison sen\ntence of up to two years. Ibid.4 Thus, except for simple\npossession offenses involving isolated categories of drugs\nnot presently at issue, only recidivist simple possession\noffenses are \u201cpunishable\u201d as a federal \u201cfelony\u201d under the\nControlled Substances Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2). And\nthus only a conviction within this particular category of\nsimple possession offenses might, conceivably, be an \u201cag\ngravated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43).\n   For a subsequent simple possession offense to be eligible\nfor an enhanced punishment, i.e., to be punishable as a\nfelony, the Controlled Substances Act requires that a\nprosecutor charge the existence of the prior simple posses\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Although    \u00a7844(a) does not expressly define a separate offense of\n\u201crecidivist simple possession,\u201d the fact of a prior conviction must none\ntheless be found before a defendant is subject to a felony sentence.\nTrue, the statutory scheme comports with Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), in which we explained that the\nConstitution does not require treating recidivism as an element of the\noffense. In other words, Congress has permissibly set out a criminal\noffense for simple possession whereby a recidivist finding by the judge,\nby a preponderance of the evidence, authorizes a punishment that\nexceeds the statutory maximum penalty for a simple possession offense.\nBut the fact of a prior conviction must still be found\u2014if only by a judge\nand if only by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014before a defendant is\nsubject to felony punishment. For present purposes, we therefore view\n\u00a7844(a)\u2019s felony simple possession provision as separate and distinct\nfrom the misdemeanor simple possession offense that section also\nprescribes.\n   4 The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates this\n\nsubsection may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more\nthan 1 year . . . except that if he commits such offense after a prior\nconviction . . . he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not\nless than 15 days but not more than 2 years . . . .\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a).\n4                CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsion conviction before trial, or before a guilty plea. See 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7851(a)(1).5 Notice, plus an opportunity to chal\nlenge the validity of the prior conviction used to enhance\nthe current conviction, \u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c), are mandatory pre\nrequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of a\nprior conviction.6 And they are also necessary prerequi\nsites under federal law to \u201cauthorize\u201d a felony punish\nment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(a), for the type of simple posses\nsion offense at issue in this case.\n   Neither the definition of an \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d offense\nunder 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) nor that of a \u201cdrug traf\nficking crime\u201d under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) describes or\nreferences any state offenses. The \u201caggravated felony\u201d\ndefinition does explain that the term applies \u201cto an offense\ndescribed in this paragraph whether in violation of Fed\neral or State law.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43). But in Lopez v. Gonzales,\n549 U. S. 47, 56 (2006), we determined that, in order to be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This subsection provides: \u201cNo person who stands convicted of an\n\noffense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by\nreason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before\nentry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information\nwith the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or\ncounsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be\nrelied upon.\u201d \u00a7851(a)(1).\n  6 We have previously recognized the mandatory nature of these re\n\nquirements, as have the courts of appeals. See United States v. La-\nBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 754, n. 1 (1997) (\u201cWe note that imposition of an\nenhanced penalty [for recidivism] is not automatic. . . . If the Govern\nment does not file such notice [under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851(a)(1)] . . . the\nlower sentencing range will be applied even though the defendant may\notherwise be eligible for the increased penalty\u201d); see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Beasley, 495 F. 3d 142, 148 (CA4 2007); United States v.\nCeballos, 302 F. 3d 679, 690\u2013692 (CA7 2002); United States v. Dodson,\n288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002); United States v. Mooring, 287 F. 3d 725,\n727\u2013728 (CA8 2002). Although \u00a7851\u2019s procedural safeguards are not\nconstitutionally compelled, see Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 247,\nthey are nevertheless a mandatory feature of the Controlled Substances\nAct and a prerequisite to securing a felony conviction under \u00a7844(a) for\na successive simple possession offense.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan \u201caggravated felony\u201d for immigration law purposes, a\nstate drug conviction must be punishable as a felony\nunder federal law. We held that \u201ca state offense consti\ntutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Sub\nstances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a\nfelony under that federal law.\u201d Id., at 60. Despite the fact\nthat the Lopez petitioner had been punished as a felon\nunder state law\u2014and, indeed, received a 5-year sen\ntence\u2014the conduct of his offense was not punishable as a\nfelony under federal law, and this prevented the state\nconviction from qualifying as an aggravated felony for\nimmigration law purposes. Id., at 55 (\u201cUnless a state\noffense is punishable as a federal felony it does not\ncount\u201d).\n   In the case before us, the Government argues that Cara\nchuri-Rosendo, despite having received only a 10-day\nsentence for his Texas misdemeanor simple possession\noffense, nevertheless has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d within the meaning of the INA. This is so,\nthe Government contends, because had Carachuri-\nRosendo been prosecuted in federal court instead of state\ncourt, he could have been prosecuted as a felon and re\nceived a 2-year sentence based on the fact of his prior\nsimple possession offense. Our holding in Lopez teaches\nthat, for a state conviction to qualify as an \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201d under the INA, it is necessary for the underlying\nconduct to be punishable as a federal felony. Id., at 60.\nWe now must determine whether the mere possibility, no\nmatter how remote, that a 2-year sentence might have\nbeen imposed in a federal trial is a sufficient basis for\nconcluding that a state misdemeanant who was not\ncharged as a recidivist has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71229b(a)(3).\n                         II\n  Carachuri-Rosendo was born in Mexico in 1978.          He\n6               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncame to the United States with his parents in 1983 and\nhas been a lawful permanent resident of Texas ever since.\nHis common-law wife and four children are American\ncitizens, as are his mother and two sisters.\n   Like so many in this country, Carachuri-Rosendo has\ngotten into some trouble with our drug laws. In 2004, he\npleaded guilty to possessing less than two ounces of mari\njuana, a Class B misdemeanor, and was sentenced to\nconfinement for 20 days by a Texas court. See App. 19a\u2013\n22a; Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7481.121(a) and\n(b)(1) (West 2003). In 2005, he pleaded nolo contendere to\npossessing less than 28 grams\u2014one tablet\u2014of alprazolam\n(known commercially as Xanax) without a prescription, a\nClass A misdemeanor. See App. 31a\u201334a; Tex. Health &\nSafety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7481.117(a) and (b). Although Texas\nlaw, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhance\nment if the prosecutor proved that Carachuri-Rosendo had\nbeen previously convicted of an offense of a similar class,\nthe State did not elect to seek an enhancement based on\nhis criminal history. App. 32a.\n   In 2006, on the basis of Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s second\npossession offense, the Federal Government initiated\nremoval proceedings against him. Appearing pro se before\nthe Immigration Judge, Carachuri-Rosendo did not dis\npute that his conviction for possessing one tablet of Xanax\nwithout a prescription made him removable,7 but he ap\nplied for a discretionary cancellation of removal pursuant\nto 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a). Under that statutory provision,\nthe Attorney General may cancel an order of removal or\nan order of inadmissibility so long as, inter alia, the non\ncitizen \u201chas not been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(a)(3). The Immigration Judge held that peti\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 But for trivial marijuana possession offenses (such as Carachuri-\n\nRosendo\u2019s 2004 state offense), virtually all drug offenses are grounds\nfor removal under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntioner\u2019s second simple possession conviction was an \u201cag\ngravated felony\u201d that made him ineligible for cancellation\nof removal.\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) followed Cir\ncuit precedent and affirmed that decision, but it disagreed\nwith the Immigration Judge\u2019s legal analysis. In its en\nbanc opinion, the BIA ruled that in cases arising in Cir\ncuits in which the question had not yet been decided, the\nBIA would not treat a second or successive misdemeanor\nconviction as an aggravated felony unless the conviction\ncontained a finding that the offender was a recidivist.\nIn re Carachuri-Rosendo, 24 I. & N. Dec. 382, 387, 391\n(2007).\n   The BIA explained that the statutory question is com\nplicated by the fact that \u201c \u2018recidivist possession\u2019 \u201d is not a\n\u201cdiscrete offense under Federal law.\u201d Id., at 388. While\nmost federal offenses are defined by elements that must be\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, recidivist\npossession is an \u201camalgam of elements, substantive sen\ntencing factors, and procedural safeguards.\u201d Id., at 389.\nSection 844(a) defines simple possession by reference to\nstatutory elements, but \u201cfacts leading to recidivist felony\npunishment, such as the existence of a prior conviction, do\nnot qualify as \u2018elements\u2019 in the traditional sense.\u201d Ibid.\n   The BIA observed, however, that \u201c21 U. S. C. \u00a7851\nprecludes a Federal judge from enhancing a drug of\nfender\u2019s sentence on the basis of recidivism absent compli\nance with a number of safeguards that, among other\nthings, serve to protect the right of the accused to notice\nand an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of an\nincreased punishment based on prior convictions.\u201d Ibid.\nTherefore, these requirements \u201care part and parcel of\nwhat it means for a crime to be a \u2018recidivist\u2019 offense.\u201d Id.,\nat 391. \u201c[U]nless the State successfully sought to impose\npunishment for a recidivist drug conviction,\u201d the BIA\nconcluded, a state simple possession \u201cconviction cannot\n8               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2018proscribe conduct punishable as\u2019 recidivist possession\u201d\nunder federal law. Ibid.\n   On review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the BIA\u2019s\ndecision in Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s case, reading our decision\nin Lopez as dictating its outcome. \u201c[I]f the conduct pro\nscribed by the state offense could have been prosecuted as\na felony\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act, the court\nreasoned, then the defendant\u2019s conviction qualifies as an\naggravated felony. 570 F. 3d 263, 267 (CA5 2009) (citing\nLopez, 549 U. S., at 60). The court deemed its analysis\n\u201cthe hypothetical approach,\u201d a term it derived from its\nunderstanding of our method of analysis in Lopez. 570\nF. 3d, at 266, and n. 3; see also United States v. Pacheco-\nDiaz, 513 F. 3d 776, 779 (CA7 2008) (per curiam) (employ\ning the \u201chypothetical-federal-felony approach\u201d). Under\nthis approach, as the Court of Appeals understood it,\ncourts \u201cg[o] beyond the state statute\u2019s elements to look at\nthe hypothetical conduct a state statute proscribes.\u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 266, n. 3. Accordingly, any \u201cconduct\u201d that \u201chypo\nthetically\u201d \u201ccould have been punished as a felony\u201d \u201chad [it]\nbeen prosecuted in federal court\u201d is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nfor federal immigration law purposes. Id., at 265. In\napplying this hypothetical approach, the Court of Appeals\ndid not discuss the \u00a7851 procedural requirements. In\nstead, it concluded that because Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s\n\u201cconduct\u201d could have been prosecuted as simple possession\nwith a recidivist enhancement under state law\u2014even\nthough it was not\u2014it could have also been punished as a\nfelony under federal law. Thus, in the Court of Appeals\u2019\nview, his conviction for simple possession under state law,\nwithout a recidivist enhancement, was an \u201caggravated\nfelony\u201d for immigration law purposes.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Since the Court of Appeals issued its decision in this case, Cara\n\nchuri-Rosendo has been removed.

Lopez,\n549 U. S., at 53. Carachuri-Rosendo is ineligible for can\ncellation of removal only if he was \u201cconvicted of a[n] ag\ngravated felony,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a), which, in this case,\ncould only be a conviction for \u201cillicit trafficking in a con\ntrolled substance . . . . including a drug trafficking crime,\u201d\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B).\n   A recidivist possession offense such as Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s does not fit easily into the \u201ceveryday under\nstanding\u201d of those terms, Lopez, 549 U. S., at 53. This\ntype of petty simple possession offense is not typically\nthought of as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or as \u201cillicit traffick\ning.\u201d We explained in Lopez that \u201cordinarily \u2018trafficking\u2019\nmeans some sort of commercial dealing.\u201d Id., at 53\u201354\n(citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004)). And\njust as in Lopez, \u201c[c]ommerce . . . was no part of\u201d Cara\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRosendo was not convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and if he contin\nues to satisfy the requirements of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a), he may still seek\ncancellation of removal even after having been removed. See \u00a71229b(a)\n(\u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who\nis inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u201d meets\nseveral criteria).\n   9 Compare 570 F. 3d 263 (CA5 2009) (holding state conviction for\n\nsimple possession after prior conviction for simple possession is a felony\nunder the Controlled Substances Act and thus an aggravated felony),\nand Fernandez v. Mukasey, 544 F. 3d 862 (CA7 2008) (same), with\nBerhe v. Gonzales, 464 F. 3d 74 (CA1 2006) (taking contrary view),\nAlsol v. Mukasey, 548 F. 3d 207 (CA2 2008) (same), Gerbier v.

HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchuri-Rosendo\u2019s possessing a single tablet of Xanax, \u201cand\ncertainly it is no element of simple possession.\u201d 549 U. S.,\nat 54. As an initial matter, then, we observe that a read\ning of this statutory scheme that would apply an \u201caggra\nvated\u201d or \u201ctrafficking\u201d label to any simple possession of\nfense is, to say the least, counterintuitive and\n\u201cunorthodox,\u201d ibid.\n  The same is true for the type of penalty at issue. We do\nnot usually think of a 10-day sentence for the unauthor\nized possession of a trivial amount of a prescription drug\nas an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d A \u201cfelony,\u201d we have come to\nunderstand, is a \u201cserious crime usu[ally] punishable by\nimprisonment for more than one year or by death.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nBlack\u2019s). An \u201caggravated\u201d offense is one \u201cmade worse or\nmore serious by circumstances such as violence, the pres\nence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another\ncrime.\u201d Id., at 75. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is unique\nto Title 8, which covers immigration matters; it is not a\nterm used elsewhere within the United States Code. Our\nstatutory criminal law classifies the most insignificant of\nfederal felonies\u2014\u201cClass E\u201d felonies\u2014as carrying a sen\ntence of \u201cless than five years but more than one year.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73559(a)(5). While it is true that a defendant\u2019s\ncriminal history might be seen to make an offense \u201cworse\u201d\nby virtue thereof, Black\u2019s 75, it is nevertheless unorthodox\nto classify this type of petty simple possession recidivism\nas an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d\n  Of course, as Justice Souter observed in his opinion for\nthe Court in Lopez, Congress, like \u201cHumpty Dumpty,\u201d has\nthe power to give words unorthodox meanings. 549 U. S.,\nat 54. But in this case the Government argues for a result\nthat \u201cthe English language tells us not to expect,\u201d so we\nmust be \u201cvery wary of the Government\u2019s position.\u201d Ibid.\nBecause the English language tells us that most aggra\nvated felonies are punishable by sentences far longer than\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n10 days, and that mere possession of one tablet of Xanax\ndoes not constitute \u201ctrafficking,\u201d Lopez instructs us to be\ndoubly wary of the Government\u2019s position in this case.10\n                              IV\n   The Government\u2019s position, like the Court of Appeals\u2019\n\u201chypothetical approach,\u201d would treat all \u201cconduct punish\nable as a felony\u201d as the equivalent of a \u201cconviction\u201d of a\nfelony whenever, hypothetically speaking, the underlying\nconduct could have received felony treatment under fed\neral law. We find this reasoning\u2014and the \u201chypothetical\napproach\u201d itself\u2014unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n   First, and most fundamentally, the Government\u2019s posi\ntion ignores the text of the INA, which limits the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s cancellation power only when, inter alia, a\nnoncitizen \u201chas . . . been convicted of a[n] aggravated\nfelony.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3) (emphasis added). The\ntext thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction\nitself as our starting place, not to what might have or\ncould have been charged. And to be convicted of an aggra\nvated felony punishable as such under the Controlled\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The Court stated in Lopez that \u201crecidivist possession, see 21\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7844(a), clearly fall[s] within the definitions used by Congress\nin 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) and 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2), regardless of\nwhether these federal possession felonies or their state counterparts\nconstitute \u2018illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u2019 or \u2018drug traffick\ning\u2019 as those terms are used in ordinary speech.\u201d 549 U. S., at 55, n. 6.\nOur decision today is not in conflict with this footnote; it is still true\nthat recidivist simple possession offenses charged and prosecuted as\nsuch \u201cclearly fall\u201d within the definition of an aggravated felony. What\nwe had no occasion to decide in Lopez, and what we now address, is\nwhat it means to be convicted of an aggravated felony. Lopez teaches\nus that it is necessary that the conduct punished under state law\ncorrespond to a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\nto be an aggravated felony under \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But it does not\ninstruct as to whether the mere possibility that conduct could be\u2014but\nis not\u2014charged as an offense punishable as a felony under federal law\nis sufficient.\n12               CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nSubstances Act, the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\nauthorized\u201d must be \u201cmore than one year,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73559(a)(5). Congress, recall, chose to authorize only a 1\nyear sentence for nearly all simple possession offenses, but\nit created a narrow exception for those cases in which a\nprosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist\nand the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to\ndefend against that charge. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851; Part I,\nsupra.\n   Indisputably, Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s record of conviction\ncontains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.\nCarachuri-Rosendo argues that even such a finding would\nbe insufficient, and that a prosecutorial charge of recidi\nvism and an opportunity to defend against that charge\nalso would be required before he could be deemed \u201ccon\nvicted\u201d of a felony punishable under the Controlled Sub\nstances Act. In the absence of any finding of recidivism,\nwe need not, and do not, decide whether these additional\nprocedures would be necessary. Although a federal immi\ngration court may have the power to make a recidivist\nfinding in the first instance, see, e.g., Almendarez-Torres\nv. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 247 (1998), it cannot,\nex post, enhance the state offense of record just because\nfacts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty\nunder either state or federal law.11 Carachuri-Rosendo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Our decision last Term in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009),\n\nalso relied upon by the Government, is not to the contrary. In that\ncase, we rejected the so-called categorical approach employed in cases\nlike United States v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), when assessing\nwhether, under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i), a noncitizen has commit\nted \u201can offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n. . . victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d Our analysis was tailored to the \u201ccircum\nstance-specific\u201d language contained in that particular subsection of the\naggravated felony definition. Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). And we specifically distinguished the \u201cgeneric\u201d categories of aggra\nvated felonies for which a categorical approach might be appropriate\u2014\nincluding the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d provision\u2014from the \u201ccircumstance\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas not actually \u201cconvicted,\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3), of a drug pos\nsession offense committed \u201cafter a prior conviction . . . has\nbecome final,\u201d \u00a7844(a), and no subsequent development\ncan undo that history.12\n  The Government contends that if Carachuri-Rosendo\nhad been prosecuted in federal court for simple possession\nunder 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a) under identical circumstances,\nhe would have committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for im\nmigration law purposes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\u201337. This is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nspecific\u201d offense at hand. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137, 8). Moreover,\nunlike the instant case, there was no debate in Nijhawan over whether\nthe petitioner actually had been \u201cconvicted\u201d of fraud; we only consid\nered how to calculate the amount of loss once a conviction for a particu\nlar category of aggravated felony has occurred.\n   12 Linking our inquiry to the record of conviction comports with how\n\nwe have categorized convictions for state offenses within the definition\nof generic federal criminal sanctions under the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e). The United States urges that our\ndecision in Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, an ACCA case, supports its\nposition in this case. Brief for Respondent 29\u201330. To the extent that\nRodriquez is relevant to the issue at hand, we think the contrary is\ntrue. In that decision we considered whether a recidivist finding under\nstate law that had the effect of increasing the \u201cmaximum term of\nimprisonment\u201d to 10 years, irrespective of the actual sentence imposed,\nmade the offense a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d within the meaning of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1) and therefore an ACCA predicate offense. 553 U. S.,\nat 382. We held that a recidivist finding could set the \u201cmaximum term\nof imprisonment,\u201d but only when the finding is a part of the record of\nconviction. Id., at 389. Indeed, we specifically observed that \u201cin those\ncases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show\nthat the defendant faced the possibility of a recidivist enhancement, it\nmay well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing\nthat a conviction was for a qualifying offense.\u201d Ibid. In other words,\nwhen the recidivist finding giving rise to a 10-year sentence is not\napparent from the sentence itself, or appears neither as part of the\n\u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d nor the \u201cformal charging document,\u201d ibid., the\nGovernment will not have established that the defendant had a prior\nconviction for which the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years\nor more (assuming the recidivist finding is a necessary precursor to\nsuch a sentence).\n14           CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso, the Government suggests, because the only statutory\ntext that matters is the word \u201cpunishable\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(2): Whatever conduct might be \u201cpunishable\u201d as a\nfelony, regardless of whether it actually is so punished or\nnot, is a felony for immigration law purposes. But for the\nreasons just stated, the circumstances of Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s prosecution were not identical to those hypothe\nsized by the Government. And the Government\u2019s ab\nstracted approach to \u00a7924(c)(2) cannot be reconciled with\nthe more concrete guidance of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a)(3),\nwhich limits the Attorney General\u2019s cancellation authority\nonly when the noncitizen has actually been \u201cconvicted of\na[n] aggravated felony\u201d\u2014not when he merely could have\nbeen convicted of a felony but was not.\n   Second, and relatedly, the Government\u2019s position fails to\ngive effect to the mandatory notice and process require\nments contained in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851. For federal law\npurposes, a simple possession offense is not \u201cpunishable\u201d\nas a felony unless a federal prosecutor first elects to\ncharge a defendant as a recidivist in the criminal informa\ntion. The statute, as described in Part I, supra, at 3\u20134,\nspeaks in mandatory terms, permitting \u201c[n]o person\u201d to be\nsubject to a recidivist enhancement\u2014and therefore, in this\ncase, a felony sentence\u2014\u201cunless\u201d he has been given notice\nof the Government\u2019s intent to prove the fact of a prior\nconviction. Federal law also gives the defendant an oppor\ntunity to challenge the fact of the prior conviction itself.\n\u00a7\u00a7851(b)\u2013(c). The Government would dismiss these proce\ndures as meaningless, so long as they may be satisfied\nduring the immigration proceeding.\n   But these procedural requirements have great practical\nsignificance with respect to the conviction itself and are\nintegral to the structure and design of our drug laws.\nThey authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when\nelecting whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Dodson, 288 F. 3d 153, 159 (CA5 2002)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cWhereas the prior version of [\u00a7851(a)] made enhance\nments for prior offenses mandatory, the new statutory\nscheme gave prosecutors discretion whether to seek en\nhancements based on prior convictions\u201d). Because the\nprocedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence,\n\u00a7851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek\na conviction that is \u201cpunishable\u201d as a felony under \u00a7844(a).\nUnderscoring the significance of the \u00a7851 procedures,\nthe United States Attorney\u2019s Manual places decisions\nwith respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on\npar with the filing of a criminal charge against a\ndefendant. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attor-\nneys\u2019 Manual \u00a79\u201327.300(B) comment. (1997), online\nat    http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/\nusam/title9/27mcrm.htm#9-27.300 (as visited June 3,\n2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). (\u201cEvery\nprosecutor should regard the filing of an information\nunder 21 U. S. C. \u00a7851 . . . as equivalent to the filing of\ncharges\u201d).\n   Many state criminal codes, like the federal scheme,\nafford similar deference to prosecutorial discretion when\nprescribing recidivist enhancements. Texas is one such\nState. See, e.g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712.42, 12.43\n(West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available \u201c[i]f it is\nshown on the trial\u201d that defendant was previously con\nvicted of identified categories of felonies and misdemean\nors). And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected\nto \u201c[a]bandon\u201d a recidivist enhancement under state law.\nApp. 32a (reproducing state judgment). Were we to permit\na federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist\nenhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen\u2019s\noffense \u201cpunishable\u201d as a felony for immigration law pur\nposes, we would denigrate the independent judgment of\nstate prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.\n   Third, the Court of Appeals\u2019 hypothetical felony ap\nproach is based on a misreading of our decision in Lopez.\n16            CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nWe never used the term \u201chypothetical\u201d to describe our\nanalysis in that case. We did look to the \u201cproscribe[d]\nconduct\u201d of a state offense to determine whether it is\n\u201cpunishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d 549 U. S.,\nat 60. But the \u201chypothetical approach\u201d employed by the\nCourt of Appeals introduces a level of conjecture at the\noutset of this inquiry that has no basis in Lopez. It ig\nnores both the conviction (the relevant statutory hook),\nand the conduct actually punished by the state offense.\nInstead, it focuses on facts known to the immigration court\nthat could have but did not serve as the basis for the state\nconviction and punishment. As the Sixth Circuit has\nexplained, this approach is really a \u201c \u2018hypothetical to a\nhypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Rashid v. Mukasey, 531 F. 3d 438, 445\n(2008). Not only does the Government wish us to consider\na fictional federal felony\u2014whether the crime for which\nCarachuri-Rosendo was actually convicted would be a\nfelony under the Controlled Substances Act\u2014but the\nGovernment also wants us to consider facts not at issue in\nthe crime of conviction (i.e., the existence of a prior convic\ntion) to determine whether Carachuri-Rosendo could have\nbeen charged with a federal felony. This methodology is\nfar removed from the more focused, categorical inquiry\nemployed in Lopez.\n   Fourth, it seems clear that the Government\u2019s argument\nis inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts.\nIt is quite unlikely that the \u201cconduct\u201d that gave rise to\nCarachuri-Rosendo\u2019s conviction would have been punished\nas a felony in federal court. Under the United States\nSentencing Guidelines, Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s recom\nmended sentence, based on the type of controlled sub\nstance at issue, would not have exceeded one year and\nvery likely would have been less than 6 months. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n\u00a72D2.1(a)(3) (Nov. 2009) (base offense level of 4). And as\nwas true in Lopez, the Government has provided us with\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nno empirical data suggesting that \u201ceven a single eager\nAssistant United States Attorney\u201d has ever sought to\nprosecute a comparable federal defendant as a felon. 549\nU. S., at 57\u201358. The Government\u2019s \u201chypothetical\u201d ap\nproach to this case is therefore misleading as well as\nspeculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s federal-court\ncounterpart would not, in actuality, have faced any felony\ncharge.\n   Finally, as we noted in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1,\n11, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced\nin immigration laws should be construed in the nonciti\nzen\u2019s favor. And here the critical language appears in a\ncriminal statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2).\n   We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d is relevant, inter alia, to the type of\nrelief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to\nwhether he is in fact removable. In other words, to the\nextent that our rejection of the Government\u2019s broad un\nderstanding of the scope of \u201caggravated felony\u201d may have\nany practical effect on policing our Nation\u2019s borders, it is a\nlimited one. Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his posi\ntion, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby\navoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal. But\nhe will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in\nthe first instance, removable. Any relief he may obtain\ndepends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.\n                         *      *    *\n  In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA, the conduct prohibited\nby state law must be punishable as a felony under federal\nlaw. See Lopez, 549 U. S., at 60. But as the text and\nstructure of the relevant statutory provisions demon\nstrate, the defendant must also have been actually con\nvicted of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under\nfederal law. The mere possibility that the defendant\u2019s\n18            CARACHURI-ROSENDO v.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that Carachuri-Rosendo\u2019s 2005\nconviction for simple possession of a tablet of Xanax in\nviolation of Texas law is not a conviction for an \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But my\nreasoning is more straightforward than the Court\u2019s, and so\nI concur only in the judgment.\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attor\nney General may cancel the removal of an alien from the\nUnited States provided the alien \u201chas not been convicted\nof any aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(3). There is no\nstatutory definition of \u201cconvicted,\u201d but a \u201cconviction\u201d is\ndefined to mean a \u201cformal judgment of guilt of the alien\nentered by a court.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(48)(A). The term \u201caggra\nvated felony\u201d includes, among many other offenses, \u201ca\ndrug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)]).\u201d\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B). A \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d is in turn\ndefined as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2).\n   It could be concluded from the provisions discussed\nabove that only a federal conviction for a felony offense\nunder the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B). But the penultimate sentence\nin \u00a71101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d \u201capplies to an offense described in this\n2             CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nparagraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\u201d\nThis language, we have said, confirms that \u201ca state offense\nwhose elements include the elements of a felony punish\nable under the [Controlled Substances Act] is an aggra\nvated felony.\u201d Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 57 (2006).\n   The conceptual problem in the present case is that the\nonly crime defined by 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a) of the Controlled\nSubstances Act, simple possession of prohibited drugs, is a\nmisdemeanor.       That misdemeanor becomes a \u201cfelony\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d only\nbecause the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes\nadditional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a\nfelony. We held in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n523 U. S. 224 (1998), that recidivism can constitutionally\nbe made a sentencing factor rather than an element of the\ncrime, despite the fact that it is used to increase the al\nlowable sentence. And we said in Lopez that a \u201cstate\npossession crim[e] that correspond[s] to\u201d the \u201cfelony viola\ntio[n]\u201d of \u201crecidivist possession\u201d in \u00a7844(a) \u201cclearly fall[s]\nwithin the definitions used by Congress . . . in\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(B) and . . . \u00a7924(c)(2).\u201d 549 U. S., at 55, n. 6.\n   But to say all that is not to say that an alien has been\n\u201cconvicted of\u201d an aggravated felony (which is what\n\u00a71229b(a)(3) requires) when he has been convicted of\nnothing more than a second state misdemeanor violation,\nthe punishment for which could, because of recidivism, be\nextended beyond one year. Just because, by reason of\nAlmendarez-Torres, the federal misdemeanor offense has\nbeen raised to a felony offense without changing its ele\nments, solely by increasing its penalty pursuant to a\nrecidivist \u201csentencing factor\u201d; it does not follow that when\nthe question is asked whether someone has been \u201ccon\nvicted of\u201d a state offense that \u201ccorresponds\u201d to the federal\nmisdemeanor-become-felony, the answer can be sought in\nsentencing factors. A defendant is not \u201cconvicted\u201d of sen\ntencing factors, but only of the elements of the crime\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncharged in the indictment. In other words, a misdemeanor\noffense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment\nto the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the\nelements of a \u201cfelony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act\u201d; but does not qualify for purposes of de\ntermining what elements the alien has been \u201cconvicted of.\u201d\n  Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only \u201cconvicted of\u201d the\ncrime of knowing possession of a controlled substance\nwithout a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor\nunder Texas law. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009). Since the ele\nments of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime\nof his conviction did not \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the Controlled\nSubstances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under\n21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a).\n  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a7924(c)(2) identifies two\nrequirements that must be satisfied for Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s state conviction to qualify as a \u201c \u2018drug trafficking\ncrime\u2019 \u201d that renders him ineligible for cancellation of\nremoval:* \u201cFirst, the offense must be a felony; second, the\noffense must be capable of punishment under the Con\ntrolled Substances Act (CSA).\u201d Lopez v. Gonzales, 549\nU. S. 47, 61 (2006) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Carachuri-\nRosendo\u2019s offense of simple possession was \u201cpunishable\nunder the [CSA],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(2), and thus satisfied the second\nrequirement, but his crime of conviction in state court was\nonly a misdemeanor. Accordingly, that offense does not\nbar him from obtaining cancellation of removal.\n  The Fifth Circuit understandably felt constrained by\nthis Court\u2019s decision in Lopez to rule otherwise. In Lopez,\nthis Court held that \u201ca state offense constitutes a \u2018felony\npunishable under the [CSA]\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b(a) (permitting cancellation of removal);\n\u00a71229b(a)(3) (barring aliens convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d from\ncancellation of removal); \u00a71101(a)(43)(B) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nas \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug\ntrafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)])\u201d); 18 U. S. C\n\u00a7924(c)(2) (defining \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to mean \u201cany felony pun\nishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d).\n2             CARACHURI-ROSENDO v. HOLDER\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npunishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d Id., at 60\n(emphasis added). Though Lopez addressed a felony\nconviction under state law that did not correlate to a\nfelony under the CSA, the Court\u2019s rule preordained the\nresult in this case:\n    \u201c[T]he Court admits that its reading will subject an\n    alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to\n    deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony\n    under the CSA. Accordingly, even if never convicted\n    of an actual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligi\n    ble for deportation based on a hypothetical federal\n    prosecution.\u201d Id., at 67 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  Today, the Court engages in jurisprudential gymnastics\nto avoid Lopez. I will not contort the law to fit the case.\nLopez was wrongly decided. But because a proper reading\nof the statutory text, see id., at 60\u201363, supports the result\nthe Court reaches today, I concur in the judgment.\n</pre>",
