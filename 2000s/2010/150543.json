FLORIDA\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF\r\n\r\n                   FLORIDA, 1ST DISTRICT\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 08–7412. Argued November 9, 2009—Decided May 17, 2010; \r\n\r\n                      modified July 6, 2010 \r\n\r\nPetitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and\r\n  another crime. Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sen\r\n  tenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt. Sub\r\n  sequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms\r\n  of his probation by committing additional crimes. The trial court ad\r\n  judicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his proba\r\n  tion, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary. Because\r\n  Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham\r\n  no possibility of release except executive clemency. He challenged his\r\n  sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Pun\r\n  ishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal af\r\n  firmed.\r\nHeld: The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to\r\n life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime. Pp. 7–31.\r\n    (a) Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the\r\n “precept . . . that punishment for crime should be graduated and pro\r\n portioned to [the] offense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349,\r\n 367. The Court’s cases implementing the proportionality standard\r\n fall within two general classifications. In cases of the first type, the\r\n Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the\r\n length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for\r\n a particular defendant’s crime. The second classification comprises\r\n cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against\r\n the death penalty. In a subset of such cases considering the nature of\r\n the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is im\r\n permissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals. E.g., Ken\r\n nedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___. In a second subset, cases turn\r\n ing on the offender’s characteristics, the Court has prohibited death\r\n2                          GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v.\r\n    Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low\r\n    range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304. In cases involving categori\r\n    cal rules, the Court first considers “objective indicia of society’s stan\r\n    dards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice” to\r\n    determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc\r\n    ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, looking to “the\r\n    standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court’s\r\n    own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment’s\r\n    text, history, meaning, and purpose,” Kennedy, supra, at ___, the\r\n    Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment\r\n    whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper,\r\n    supra, at 564. Because this case implicates a particular type of sen\r\n    tence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed\r\n    a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical ap\r\n    proach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy. Pp. 7–10.\r\n       (b) Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that\r\n    the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional. Pp. 10–31.\r\n         (1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for\r\n    any juvenile offenders. Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole\r\n    for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Thirty-seven\r\n    States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit\r\n    sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in\r\n    some circumstances. The State relies on these data to argue that no\r\n    national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.\r\n    An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions\r\n    that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\r\n    however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide,\r\n    there are only 123 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sen\r\n    tences for nonhomicide crimes. Because 77 of those offenders are\r\n    serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 46 are imprisoned\r\n    in just 10 States, it appears that only 11 jurisdictions nationwide in\r\n    fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide of\r\n    fenders, while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal\r\n    Government do not impose them despite apparent statutory authori\r\n    zation. Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomi\r\n    cide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence\r\n    stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sen\r\n    tences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.\r\n    While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentenc\r\n    ing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the\r\n    type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing\r\n    practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposi\r\n    tion. The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the\r\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nsentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not nec\r\nessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have delib\r\nerately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate. See\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850. Pp. 10–16.\r\n     (2) The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without\r\nparole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited cul\r\npability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead\r\nthe Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel\r\nand unusual. No recent data provide reason to reconsider Roper’s\r\nholding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less\r\ndeserving of the most serious forms of punishment. 543 U. S., at 551.\r\nMoreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that\r\nlife will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments\r\nthan are murderers. E.g., Kennedy, supra. Serious nonhomicide\r\ncrimes “may be devastating in their harm . . . but ‘in terms of moral\r\ndepravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,’ . . . they\r\ncannot be compared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ”\r\nId., at ___. Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile of\r\nfender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral\r\nculpability. Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analy\r\nsis. As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second most\r\nsevere penalty permitted by law,” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.\r\n957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on\r\naverage serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in\r\nprison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572. And\r\nnone of the legitimate goals of penal sanctions—retribution, deter\r\nrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538\r\nU. S. 11, 25—is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573. Be\r\ncause age “18 is the point where society draws the line for many pur\r\nposes between childhood and adulthood,” it is the age below which a\r\ndefendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomi\r\ncide crime. Id., at 574. A State is not required to guarantee eventual\r\nfreedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that pro\r\nvides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demon\r\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first\r\ninstance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.\r\nPp. 16–24.\r\n     (3) A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two\r\nalternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional con\r\ncerns. First, although Florida and other States have made substan\r\ntial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of\r\nyouthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sen\r\ntence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a\r\n4                         GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and\r\n    are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender\r\n    will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability. Sec\r\n    ond, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offender’s\r\n    age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross\r\n    disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with\r\n    sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psy\r\n    chological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sen\r\n    tence from the many that have the capacity for change. Cf. Roper,\r\n    supra, at 572–573. Nor does such an approach take account of spe\r\n    cial difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation,\r\n    given juveniles’ impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long\r\n    term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults. A categorical rule\r\n    avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury\r\n    will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently\r\n    culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide. It also\r\n    gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and re\r\n    form. Pp. 24–29.\r\n          (4) Additional support for the Court’s conclusion lies in the fact\r\n    that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over:\r\n    The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sen\r\n    tence. While the judgments of other nations and the international\r\n    community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth\r\n    Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent\r\n    conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual. See,\r\n    e.g., Roper, supra, at 575–578.

The sentence was\r\nimposed by the State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the\r\nsentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Un\r\nusual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States\r\nby the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nRobinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).\r\n                            I\r\n  Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on\r\nJanuary 6, 1987. Graham’s parents were addicted to\r\ncrack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early\r\nyears. Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hy\r\nperactivity disorder in elementary school. He began\r\ndrinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked\r\nmarijuana at age 13.\r\n  In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three\r\nother school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque\r\nrestaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. One youth, who\r\nworked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just\r\n2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbefore closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing\r\nmasks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham’s\r\nmasked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager\r\nin the back of the head with a metal bar. When the man\r\nager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two\r\nyouths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third\r\naccomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for\r\nhis head injury. No money was taken.\r\n   Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under\r\nFlorida law, it is within a prosecutor’s discretion whether\r\nto charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for\r\nmost felony crimes. Fla. Stat. §985.227(1)(b) (2003) (sub\r\nsequently renumbered at §985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Gra\r\nham’s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.\r\nThe charges against Graham were armed burglary with\r\nassault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maxi\r\nmum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility\r\nof parole, §§810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted\r\narmed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maxi\r\nmum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, §§812.13(2)(b),\r\n777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).\r\n   On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both\r\ncharges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to\r\nthe trial court. After reciting “this is my first and last\r\ntime getting in trouble,” he continued “I’ve decided to turn\r\nmy life around.” App. 379–380. Graham said “I made a\r\npromise to God and myself that if I get a second chance,\r\nI’m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National\r\nFootball League].” Id., at 380.\r\n   The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court\r\nwithheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and\r\nsentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of proba\r\ntion. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of\r\nhis probation in the county jail, but he received credit for\r\nthe time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on\r\nJune 25, 2004.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          3\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2,\r\n2004, Graham again was arrested. The State’s case was\r\nas follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a\r\nhome invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo\r\nBailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.\r\nAccording to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham,\r\nBailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home\r\nwhere Carlos Rodriguez lived. Graham, followed by Bailey\r\nand Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol\r\nto Rodriguez’s chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three\r\nheld Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at\r\ngunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for\r\nmoney. Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices\r\nbarricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.\r\n   The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and\r\nLawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second\r\nrobbery, during which Bailey was shot. Graham, who had\r\nborrowed his father’s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to\r\nthe hospital and left them there. As Graham drove away,\r\na police sergeant signaled him to stop. Graham continued\r\nat a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole. He\r\ntried to flee on foot but was apprehended. Three hand\r\nguns were found in his car.\r\n   When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied in\r\nvolvement in the crimes. He said he encountered Bailey\r\nand Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot. One of the\r\ndetectives told Graham that the victims of the home inva\r\nsion had identified him. He asked Graham, “Aside from\r\nthe two robberies tonight how many more were you in\r\nvolved in?” Graham responded, “Two to three before\r\ntonight.” Id., at 160. The night that Graham allegedly\r\ncommitted the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th\r\nbirthday.\r\n   On December 13, 2004, Graham’s probation officer filed\r\nwith the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham\r\nhad violated the conditions of his probation by possessing\r\n4                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\na firearm, committing crimes, and associating with per\r\nsons engaged in criminal activity. The trial court held\r\nhearings on Graham’s violations about a year later, in\r\nDecember 2005 and January 2006. The judge who pre\r\nsided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham’s\r\nguilty plea to the earlier offenses.\r\n   Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the\r\nhome invasion robbery; but, even after the court under\r\nscored that the admission could expose him to a life sen\r\ntence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating proba\r\ntion conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence\r\nrelated to the home invasion, including testimony from the\r\nvictims. The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting\r\nhis attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating\r\nhis probation. The court further found that Graham had\r\nviolated his probation by committing a home invasion\r\nrobbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with\r\npersons engaged in criminal activity.\r\n   The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Flor\r\nida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive\r\nabsent a downward departure by the judge was 5 years’\r\nimprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment.\r\nGraham’s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture\r\nsentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the\r\nFlorida Department of Corrections recommended that\r\nGraham receive an even lower sentence—at most 4 years’\r\nimprisonment. The State recommended that Graham\r\nreceive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years\r\non the attempted armed robbery count.\r\n   After hearing Graham’s testimony, the trial court ex\r\nplained the sentence it was about to pronounce:\r\n      “Mr. Graham, as I look back on your case, yours is\r\n    really candidly a sad situation.

I don’t know why.\r\n   “But you did, and that is what is so sad about this\r\ntoday is that you have actually been given a chance to\r\nget through this, the original charge, which were very\r\nserious charges to begin with. . . . The attempted rob\r\nbery with a weapon was a very serious charge.\r\n  .            .              .                .      .\r\n   “[I]n a very short period of time you were back be\r\nfore the Court on a violation of this probation, and\r\nthen here you are two years later standing before me,\r\nliterally the—facing a life sentence as to—up to life as\r\nto count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.\r\n   “And I don’t understand why you would be given\r\nsuch a great opportunity to do something with your\r\nlife and why you would throw it away. The only thing\r\nthat I can rationalize is that you decided that this is\r\nhow you were going to lead your life and that there is\r\nnothing that we can do for you. And as the state\r\npointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of\r\ncriminal conduct on your part and that we can’t help\r\nyou any further.

It sen\r\ntenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law\r\non each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary\r\nand 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because\r\nFlorida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat.\r\n§921.002(1)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant\r\nno possibility of release unless he is granted executive\r\nclemency.\r\n  Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his\r\nsentence under the Eighth Amendment. The motion was\r\ndeemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it\r\nwithin 60 days. The First District Court of Appeal of\r\nFlorida affirmed, concluding that Graham’s sentence was\r\nnot grossly disproportionate to his crimes. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1636586\"><a href=\"/opinion/1636586/graham-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(2008).

S. ___ (2009).\r\n                              II\r\n   The Eighth Amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not\r\nbe required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and\r\nunusual punishments inflicted.” To determine whether a\r\npunishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look beyond\r\nhistorical conceptions to “ ‘the evolving standards of de\r\ncency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ”\r\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop\r\nv. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\r\n“This is because ‘[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not\r\nmerely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral\r\njudgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its\r\napplicability must change as the basic mores of society\r\nchange.’ ” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\r\n(slip op., at 8) (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,\r\n382 (1972) (Burger, C. J., dissenting)).\r\n   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits\r\nthe imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under\r\nall circumstances. See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730\r\n(2002). “[P]unishments of torture,” for example, “are\r\nforbidden.” Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879).\r\nThese cases underscore the essential principle that, under\r\nthe Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the hu\r\nman attributes even of those who have committed serious\r\ncrimes.\r\n   For the most part, however, the Court’s precedents\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nconsider punishments challenged not as inherently bar\r\nbaric but as disproportionate to the crime. The concept of\r\nproportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.\r\nEmbodied in the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual\r\npunishments is the “precept of justice that punishment for\r\ncrime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] of\r\nfense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910).\r\n   The Court’s cases addressing the proportionality of\r\nsentences fall within two general classifications. The first\r\ninvolves challenges to the length of term-of-years sen\r\ntences given all the circumstances in a particular case.\r\nThe second comprises cases in which the Court imple\r\nments the proportionality standard by certain categorical\r\nrestrictions on the death penalty.\r\n   In the first classification the Court considers all of the\r\ncircumstances of the case to determine whether the sen\r\ntence is unconstitutionally excessive. Under this ap\r\nproach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without\r\nparole sentence for the defendant’s seventh nonviolent\r\nfelony, the crime of passing a worthless check. Solem v.\r\nHelm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). In other cases, however, it\r\nhas been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of\r\nproportionality. A leading case is Harmelin v. Michigan,\r\n501 U. S. 957 (1991), in which the offender was sentenced\r\nunder state law to life without parole for possessing a\r\nlarge quantity of cocaine. A closely divided Court upheld\r\nthe sentence. The controlling opinion concluded that the\r\nEighth Amendment contains a “narrow proportionality\r\nprinciple,” that “does not require strict proportionality\r\nbetween crime and sentence” but rather “forbids only\r\nextreme sentences that are ‘grossly disproportionate’ to\r\nthe crime.” Id., at 997, 1000–1001 (KENNEDY, J., concur\r\nring in part and concurring in judgment). Again closely\r\ndivided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25\r\nyears to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under Califor\r\nnia’s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nEwing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also Lockyer\r\nv. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also up\r\nheld a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a\r\ndefendant’s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining\r\nmoney by false pretenses, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263\r\n(1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of mari\r\njuana with intent to distribute and distribution of mari\r\njuana, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam).\r\n  The controlling opinion in Harmelin explained its ap\r\nproach for determining whether a sentence for a term of\r\nyears is grossly disproportionate for a particular defen\r\ndant’s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity\r\nof the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S.,\r\nat 1005 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). “[I]n the rare case in\r\nwhich [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an infer\r\nence of gross disproportionality” the court should then\r\ncompare the defendant’s sentence with the sentences\r\nreceived by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and\r\nwith the sentences imposed for the same crime in other\r\njurisdictions. Ibid. If this comparative analysis “vali\r\ndate[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly\r\ndisproportionate,” the sentence is cruel and unusual. Ibid.\r\n   The second classification of cases has used categorical\r\nrules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previ\r\nous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.\r\nThe classification in turn consists of two subsets, one\r\nconsidering the nature of the offense, the other consider\r\ning the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the\r\nnature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital\r\npunishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes\r\nagainst individuals. Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at 28);\r\nsee also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Coker v.\r\nGeorgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the\r\ncharacteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted\r\ncategorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defen\r\ndants who committed their crimes before the age of 18,\r\n10                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), or whose intellec\r\ntual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536\r\nU. S. 304 (2002). See also Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487\r\nU. S. 815 (1988).\r\n   In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has\r\ntaken the following approach. The Court first considers\r\n“objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in\r\nlegislative enactments and state practice” to determine\r\nwhether there is a national consensus against the sentenc\r\ning practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, guided\r\nby “the standards elaborated by controlling precedents\r\nand by the Court’s own understanding and interpretation\r\nof the Eighth Amendment’s text, history, meaning, and\r\npurpose,” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the\r\nCourt must determine in the exercise of its own inde\r\npendent judgment whether the punishment in question\r\nviolates the Constitution. Roper, supra, at 564.\r\n   The present case involves an issue the Court has not\r\nconsidered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of\r\nyears sentence. The approach in cases such as Harmelin\r\nand Ewing is suited for considering a gross proportionality\r\nchallenge to a particular defendant’s sentence, but here a\r\nsentencing practice itself is in question. This case impli\r\ncates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an\r\nentire class of offenders who have committed a range of\r\ncrimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the\r\nseverity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does\r\nnot advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the ques\r\ntion presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in\r\ncases that involved the categorical approach, specifically\r\nAtkins, Roper, and Kennedy.\r\n                          III\r\n                           A\r\n  The analysis begins with objective indicia of national\r\nconsensus. “[T]he ‘clearest and most reliable objective\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six\r\njurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for\r\nany juvenile offenders. See Appendix, infra, Part III.\r\nSeven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile\r\noffenders, but only for homicide crimes. Id., Part II.\r\nThirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia\r\npermit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile non\r\nhomicide offender in some circumstances. Id., Part I.\r\nFederal law also allows for the possibility of life without\r\nparole for offenders as young as 13. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\r\n§§2241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying\r\non this metric, the State and its amici argue that there is\r\nno national consensus against the sentencing practice at\r\nissue.\r\n  This argument is incomplete and unavailing. “There are\r\nmeasures of consensus other than legislation.” Kennedy,\r\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). Actual sentencing practices\r\nare an important part of the Court’s inquiry into consen\r\nsus. See Enmund, supra, at 794–796; Thompson, supra,\r\nat 831–832 (plurality opinion); Atkins, supra, at 316;\r\nRoper, supra, at 564–565; Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\r\nat 22–23). Here, an examination of actual sentencing\r\npractices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is\r\npermitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.\r\nAlthough these statutory schemes contain no explicit\r\nprohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infre\r\nquent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are\r\nonly 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life with\r\nout parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D.\r\nRasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for\r\nNon-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2\r\n(Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).\r\n  The State contends that this study’s tally is inaccurate\r\n12                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbecause it does not count juvenile offenders who were\r\nconvicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense,\r\neven when the offender received a life without parole\r\nsentence for the nonhomicide. See Brief for Respondent\r\n34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009,\r\nNo. 08–7621, pp. 28–31. This distinction is unpersuasive.\r\nJuvenile offenders who committed both homicide and\r\nnonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a\r\nsentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed\r\nno homicide. It is difficult to say that a defendant who\r\nreceives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who\r\nwas at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some\r\nsense being punished in part for the homicide when the\r\njudge makes the sentencing determination. The instant\r\ncase concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced\r\nto life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.\r\n   Florida further criticizes this study because the authors\r\nwere unable to obtain complete information on some\r\nStates and because the study was not peer reviewed. See\r\nBrief for Respondent 40. The State does not, however,\r\nprovide any data of its own. Although in the first instance\r\nit is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we\r\nhave been able to supplement the study’s findings. The\r\nstudy’s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally\r\nfor Nevada, Utah, or Virginia. See Annino 11–13. Our\r\nresearch shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has\r\nnone, and Virginia has eight. See Letter from Alejandra\r\nLivingston, Offender Management Division, Nevada Dept.\r\nof Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 26, 2010)\r\n(available in Clerk of Court’s case file); Letter from Steve\r\nGehrke, Utah Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court\r\nLibrary (Mar. 29, 2010) (same); Letter from Dr. Tama S.\r\nCeli, Virginia Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court\r\nLibrary (Mar. 30, 2010) (same). Finally, since the study\r\nwas completed, a defendant in Oklahoma has apparently\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

See Stogsdill, Dela-\r\nware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa\r\nWorld, May 4, 2010, p. A12.\r\n  Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to\r\nthose we have been able to locate independently, there are\r\n123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without\r\nparole sentences. A significant majority of those, 77 in\r\ntotal, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. Annino 2.\r\nThe other 46 are imprisoned in just 10 States—California,\r\nDelaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ne-\r\nvada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia. Id., at 14;\r\nsupra, at 12–13; Letter from Thomas P. Hoey, Dept. of\r\nCorrections, Government of the District of Columbia, to\r\nSupreme Court Library (Mar. 31, 2010) (available in Clerk\r\nof Court’s case file); Letter from Judith Simon Garrett,\r\nU. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), to\r\nSupreme Court Library (Apr. 9, 2010) (available in Clerk\r\nof Court’s case file). Thus, only 11 jurisdictions nation-\r\nwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juve-\r\nnile nonhomicide offenders—and most of those do so quite\r\nrarely—while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the\r\nFederal Government do not impose them despite statutory\r\nauthorization.*\r\n  The numbers cited above reflect all current convicts in a\r\n——————\r\n   * When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a report from the BOP\r\nstating that there are six juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life\r\nwithout parole in the federal system. The Acting Solicitor General\r\nsubsequently informed the Court that further review revealed that\r\nnone of the six prisoners referred to in the earlier BOP report is serving\r\na life without parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime\r\ncompleted before the age of 18. Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting\r\nSolicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (May 24, 2010)\r\n(available in Clerk of Court’s case file). The letter further stated that\r\nthe Government was not aware of any other federal prisoners serving\r\nlife without parole sentences solely for juvenile nonhomicide crimes.\r\nIbid. The opinion was amended in light of this new information.\r\n14                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\njurisdiction’s penal system, regardless of when they were\r\nconvicted. It becomes all the more clear how rare these\r\nsentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do some\r\ntimes impose them, when one considers that a juvenile\r\nsentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison\r\nfor decades. Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all\r\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life\r\nwithout parole sentence stretching back many years. It is\r\nnot certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender nationwide serving a life without\r\nparole sentence, for the statistics are not precise. The\r\navailable data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate\r\nhow rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are\r\nisolated cases that have not been included in the presenta\r\ntions of the parties or the analysis of the Court.\r\n   It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute num\r\nbers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomi\r\ncides are more common than the sentencing practices at\r\nissue in some of this Court’s other Eighth Amendment\r\ncases. See, e.g., Enmund, 458 U. S., at 794 (only six exe\r\ncutions of nontriggerman felony murderers between 1954\r\nand 1982) Atkins, 536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of\r\nmentally retarded defendants in 13-year period). This\r\ncontrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first\r\ngiven to the base number of certain types of offenses. For\r\nexample, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which\r\nstatistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult\r\nand juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes. That\r\nsame year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated\r\nassault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900\r\nfor burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for\r\narson. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and\r\nDelinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online\r\nat http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010,\r\nand available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Although it is\r\nnot certain how many of these numerous juvenile offend\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ners were eligible for life without parole sentences, the\r\ncomparison suggests that in proportion to the opportuni\r\nties for its imposition, life without parole sentences for\r\njuveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as\r\nother sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.\r\n   The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact\r\nthat many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders. The Court confronted\r\na similar situation in Thompson, where a plurality con\r\ncluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than\r\n16 was unconstitutional. A number of States then allowed\r\nthe juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory\r\nscheme. As is the case here, those States authorized the\r\ntransfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at\r\nthat point there was no statutory differentiation between\r\nadults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties.\r\nThe plurality concluded that the transfer laws show “that\r\nthe States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be\r\ntried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be\r\ndealt with effectively in juvenile court), but tells us noth\r\ning about the judgment these States have made regarding\r\nthe appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.”\r\n487 U. S., at 826, n. 24. Justice O’Connor, concurring in\r\nthe judgment, took a similar view. Id., at 850 (“When a\r\nlegislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed\r\nthrough the adult criminal justice system, and capital\r\npunishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the\r\ndeath penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to\r\nsuch defendants. . . . [H]owever, it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have\r\ndeliberately concluded that it would be appropriate”).\r\n   The same reasoning obtains here. Many States have\r\nchosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to\r\nallow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in,\r\nadult court under certain circumstances. Once in adult\r\ncourt, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence\r\n16                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                 Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nas would be given to an adult offender, including a life\r\nwithout parole sentence. But the fact that transfer and\r\ndirect charging laws make life without parole possible for\r\nsome juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not justify a\r\njudgment that many States intended to subject such of\r\nfenders to life without parole sentences.\r\n   For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be\r\nprosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sen\r\ntenced to life without parole. The State acknowledged at\r\noral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could\r\nreceive such a sentence under the letter of the law. See\r\nTr. of Oral Arg. 36–37. All would concede this to be unre\r\nalistic, but the example underscores that the statutory\r\neligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does\r\nnot indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through\r\ndeliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.\r\nSimilarly, the many States that allow life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the\r\npunishment should not be treated as if they have ex\r\npressed the view that the sentence is appropriate. The\r\nsentencing practice now under consideration is exceed\r\ningly rare. And “it is fair to say that a national consensus\r\nhas developed against it.” Atkins, supra, at 316.\r\n                                B\r\n  Community consensus, while “entitled to great weight,”\r\nis not itself determinative of whether a punishment is\r\ncruel and unusual. Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\r\n24). In accordance with the constitutional design, “the\r\ntask of interpreting the Eighth Amendment remains our\r\nresponsibility.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 575. The judicial\r\nexercise of independent judgment requires consideration\r\nof the culpability of the offenders at issue in light of their\r\ncrimes and characteristics, along with the severity of the\r\npunishment in question. Id., at 568; Kennedy, supra, at\r\n___ (slip op., at 27–28); cf. Solem, 463 U. S., at 292. In this\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 569. As compared to adults,\r\njuveniles have a “ ‘lack of maturity and an underdeveloped\r\nsense of responsibility’ ”; they “are more vulnerable or\r\nsusceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\r\nincluding peer pressure”; and their characters are “not as\r\nwell formed.” Id., at 569–570. These salient characteris\r\ntics mean that “[i]t is difficult even for expert psycholo\r\ngists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose\r\ncrime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and\r\nthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\r\ncorruption.” Id., at 573. Accordingly, “juvenile offenders\r\ncannot with reliability be classified among the worst of\r\nfenders.” Id., at 569. A juvenile is not absolved of respon\r\nsibility for his actions, but his transgression “is not as\r\nmorally reprehensible as that of an adult.” Thompson,\r\nsupra, at 835 (plurality opinion).\r\n   No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court’s\r\nobservations in Roper about the nature of juveniles. As\r\npetitioner’s amici point out, developments in psychology\r\nand brain science continue to show fundamental differ\r\nences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,\r\nparts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to\r\nmature through late adolescence. See Brief for American\r\nMedical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–24; Brief for\r\nAmerican Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae\r\n22–27. Juveniles are more capable of change than are\r\nadults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of\r\n“irretrievably depraved character” than are the actions of\r\nadults. Roper, 543 U. S., at 570. It remains true that\r\n“[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to\r\n18                  GRAHAM v.

These matters relate to the\r\nstatus of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to\r\nconsider next the nature of the offenses to which this\r\nharsh penalty might apply.\r\n  The Court has recognized that defendants who do not\r\nkill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are\r\ncategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of\r\npunishment than are murderers. Kennedy, supra; En\r\nmund, 458 U. S. 782; Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137\r\n(1987); Coker, 433 U. S. 584. There is a line “between\r\nhomicide and other serious violent offenses against the\r\nindividual.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).\r\nSerious nonhomicide crimes “may be devastating in their\r\nharm . . . but ‘in terms of moral depravity and of the injury\r\nto the person and to the public,’ . . . they cannot be com\r\npared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ” Id.,\r\nat ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Coker, 433 U. S., at 598\r\n(plurality opinion)). This is because “[l]ife is over for the\r\nvictim of the murderer,” but for the victim of even a very\r\nserious nonhomicide crime, “life . . . is not over and nor\r\nmally is not beyond repair.” Ibid. (plurality opinion).\r\nAlthough an offense like robbery or rape is “a serious\r\ncrime deserving serious punishment,” Enmund, supra, at\r\n797, those crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral\r\nsense.\r\n  It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a\r\njuvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a\r\ntwice diminished moral culpability.        The age of the\r\noffender and the nature of the crime each bear on the\r\nanalysis.\r\n  As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second\r\nmost severe penalty permitted by law.” Harmelin, 501\r\nU. S., at 1001 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). It is true that a\r\ndeath sentence is “unique in its severity and irrevocabil\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. 153, 187 (1976) (joint\r\nopinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); yet life\r\nwithout parole sentences share some characteristics with\r\ndeath sentences that are shared by no other sentences.\r\nThe State does not execute the offender sentenced to life\r\nwithout parole, but the sentence alters the offender’s life\r\nby a forfeiture that is irrevocable. It deprives the convict\r\nof the most basic liberties without giving hope of restora\r\ntion, except perhaps by executive clemency—the remote\r\npossibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the\r\nsentence. Solem, 463 U. S., at 300–301. As one court\r\nobserved in overturning a life without parole sentence for\r\na juvenile defendant, this sentence “means denial of hope;\r\nit means that good behavior and character improvement\r\nare immaterial; it means that whatever the future might\r\nhold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he\r\nwill remain in prison for the rest of his days.” Naovarath\r\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1167554\"><a href=\"/opinion/1167554/naovarath-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526, 779 P. 2d 944 (1989).\r\n   The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that\r\ndeny convicts the possibility of parole. In Rummel, 445\r\nU. S. 263, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment chal\r\nlenge to a life sentence for a defendant’s third nonviolent\r\nfelony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant\r\nthe possibility of parole. Noting that “parole is an estab\r\nlished variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,”\r\nit was evident that an analysis of the petitioner’s sentence\r\n“could hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actu\r\nally be imprisoned for the rest of his life.” Id., at 280–281\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And in Solem, the\r\nonly previous case striking down a sentence for a term of\r\nyears as grossly disproportionate, the defendant’s sentence\r\nwas deemed “far more severe than the life sentence we\r\nconsidered in Rummel,” because it did not give the defen\r\ndant the possibility of parole. 463 U. S., at 297.\r\n   Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment\r\nfor a juvenile. Under this sentence a juvenile offender will\r\n20                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\non average serve more years and a greater percentage of\r\nhis life in prison than an adult offender. A 16-year-old\r\nand a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole\r\nreceive the same punishment in name only. See Roper,\r\nsupra, at 572; cf. Harmelin, supra, at 996 (“In some cases\r\n. . . there will be negligible difference between life without\r\nparole and other sentences of imprisonment—for example,\r\n. . . a lengthy term sentence without eligibility for parole,\r\ngiven to a 65-year-old man”). This reality cannot be\r\nignored.\r\n    The penological justifications for the sentencing practice\r\nare also relevant to the analysis. Kennedy, supra, at ___\r\n(slip op., at 30–36); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571–572; Atkins,\r\nsupra, at 318–320. Criminal punishment can have differ\r\nent goals, and choosing among them is within a legisla\r\nture’s discretion. See Harmelin, supra, at 999 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J.) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment does not man\r\ndate adoption of any one penological theory”). It does not\r\nfollow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal\r\nsanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth\r\nAmendment restrictions. A sentence lacking any legiti\r\nmate penological justification is by its nature dispropor\r\ntionate to the offense. With respect to life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of\r\npenal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate—\r\nretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation,\r\nsee Ewing, 538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion)—provides\r\nan adequate justification.\r\n    Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it\r\ncannot support the sentence at issue here. Society is\r\nentitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomi\r\ncide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and\r\nto seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the\r\noffense. But “[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is\r\nthat a criminal sentence must be directly related to the\r\npersonal culpability of the criminal offender.” Tison, 481\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nU. S., at 149. And as Roper observed, “[w]hether viewed\r\nas an attempt to express the community’s moral outrage\r\nor as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the\r\nvictim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a\r\nminor as with an adult.” 543 U. S., at 571. The case\r\nbecomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did\r\nnot commit homicide. Roper found that “[r]etribution is\r\nnot proportional if the law’s most severe penalty is im\r\nposed” on the juvenile murderer. Ibid. The considerations\r\nunderlying that holding support as well the conclusion\r\nthat retribution does not justify imposing the second most\r\nsevere penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffender.\r\n   Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence ei\r\nther. Roper noted that “the same characteristics that\r\nrender juveniles less culpable than adults suggest . . . that\r\njuveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.” Ibid.\r\nBecause juveniles’ “lack of maturity and underdeveloped\r\nsense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous and\r\nill-considered actions and decisions,” Johnson v. Texas,\r\n509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a\r\npossible punishment into consideration when making\r\ndecisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is\r\nrarely imposed. That the sentence deters in a few cases is\r\nperhaps plausible, but “[t]his argument does not overcome\r\nother objections.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\r\n31). Even if the punishment has some connection to a\r\nvalid penological goal, it must be shown that the punish\r\nment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justifi\r\ncation offered. Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders’ diminished moral responsibility, any limited\r\ndeterrent effect provided by life without parole is not\r\nenough to justify the sentence.\r\n   Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprison\r\nment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in\r\nquestion here. Recidivism is a serious risk to public\r\n22                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsafety, and so incapacitation is an important goal. See\r\nEwing, supra, at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67\r\npercent of former inmates released from state prisons are\r\ncharged with at least one serious new crime within three\r\nyears). But while incapacitation may be a legitimate\r\npenological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in\r\nother contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment\r\nfor juveniles who did not commit homicide. To justify life\r\nwithout parole on the assumption that the juvenile of\r\nfender forever will be a danger to society requires the\r\nsentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorri\r\ngible. The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment\r\nquestionable. “It is difficult even for expert psychologists\r\nto differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime\r\nreflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the\r\nrare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\r\ncorruption.” Roper, supra, at 573. As one court concluded\r\nin a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14\r\nyear-old, “incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.”\r\nWorkman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky.\r\nApp. 1968).\r\n   Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an\r\nimmediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume,\r\nserious crimes early in his term of supervised release and\r\ndespite his own assurances of reform. Graham deserved\r\nto be separated from society for some time in order to\r\nprevent what the trial court described as an “escalating\r\npattern of criminal conduct,” App. 394, but it does not\r\nfollow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his\r\nlife. Even if the State’s judgment that Graham was incor\r\nrigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or\r\nfailure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate\r\nbecause that judgment was made at the outset. A life\r\nwithout parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile\r\noffender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.\r\nIncapacitation cannot override all other considerations,\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nlest the Eighth Amendment’s rule against disproportion\r\nate sentences be a nullity.\r\n   Finally there is rehabilitation, a penological goal that\r\nforms the basis of parole systems. See Solem, 463 U. S., at\r\n300; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989).\r\nThe concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility\r\nand proper implementation are the subject of a substan\r\ntial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue. See, e.g., Cul\r\nlen & Gendreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation:\r\nPolicy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000,\r\npp. 119–133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding\r\nthe effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several\r\ndecades). It is for legislatures to determine what rehabili\r\ntative techniques are appropriate and effective.\r\n   A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, how\r\never, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The\r\npenalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By\r\ndenying the defendant the right to reenter the community,\r\nthe State makes an irrevocable judgment about that per\r\nson’s value and place in society. This judgment is not\r\nappropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender’s\r\ncapacity for change and limited moral culpability. A\r\nState’s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a\r\nmere expressive judgment. As one amicus notes, defen\r\ndants serving life without parole sentences are often de\r\nnied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative\r\nservices that are available to other inmates. See Brief for\r\nSentencing Project as Amicus Curiae 11–13. For juvenile\r\noffenders, who are most in need of and receptive to reha\r\nbilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici\r\nCuriae 28–31 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of\r\nrehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the dis\r\nproportionality of the sentence all the more evident.\r\n   In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life\r\nwithout parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This\r\ndetermination; the limited culpability of juvenile non\r\n24                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhomicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole\r\nsentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing\r\npractice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This\r\nCourt now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not\r\ncommit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the\r\nsentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary\r\nto prevent the possibility that life without parole sen\r\ntences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders\r\nwho are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punish\r\nment. Because “[t]he age of 18 is the point where society\r\ndraws the line for many purposes between childhood and\r\nadulthood,” those who were below that age when the\r\noffense was committed may not be sentenced to life with\r\nout parole for a nonhomicide crime. Roper, 543 U. S., at\r\n574.\r\n  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to\r\na juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.\r\nWhat the State must do, however, is give defendants like\r\nGraham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release\r\nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is\r\nfor the State, in the first instance, to explore the means\r\nand mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, how\r\never, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State\r\nfrom imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to\r\nrelease that offender during his natural life. Those who\r\ncommit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out\r\nto be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for\r\nthe duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does\r\nnot foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of\r\nnonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will\r\nremain behind bars for life. It does forbid States from\r\nmaking the judgment at the outset that those offenders\r\nnever will be fit to reenter society.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              C\r\n   Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is neces\r\nsary here. Two alternative approaches are not adequate\r\nto address the relevant constitutional concerns. First, the\r\nState argues that the laws of Florida and other States\r\ngoverning criminal procedure take sufficient account of\r\nthe age of a juvenile offender. Here, Florida notes that\r\nunder its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and\r\n17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious\r\nfelonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those\r\noffenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors\r\nmay not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders\r\nas adults for misdemeanors. Brief for Respondent 54\r\n(citing Fla. Stat. §985.227 (2003)). The State also stresses\r\nthat “in only the narrowest of circumstances” does Florida\r\nlaw impose no age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juve\r\nniles in adult court. Brief for Respondent 54.\r\n   Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring con\r\nsideration of a defendant’s age in charging decisions are\r\nsalutary. An offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth\r\nAmendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take\r\ndefendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be\r\nflawed. Florida, like other States, has made substantial\r\nefforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treat\r\nment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system.\r\nSee generally Fla. Stat. §958 et seq. (2007).\r\n   The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by\r\nthemselves insufficient to address the constitutional con\r\ncerns at issue. Nothing in Florida’s laws prevents its\r\ncourts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to\r\nlife without parole based on a subjective judgment that the\r\ndefendant’s crimes demonstrate an “irretrievably de\r\npraved character.” Roper, supra, at 570. This is inconsis\r\ntent with the Eighth Amendment. Specific cases are\r\nillustrative. In Graham’s case the sentencing judge de\r\ncided to impose life without parole—a sentence greater\r\n26                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthan that requested by the prosecutor—for Graham’s\r\narmed burglary conviction. The judge did so because he\r\nconcluded that Graham was incorrigible: “[Y]ou decided\r\nthat this is how you were going to lead your life and that\r\nthere is nothing that we can do for you. . . . We can’t do\r\nanything to deter you.” App. 394.\r\n   Another example comes from Sullivan v. Florida,\r\nNo. 08–7621. Sullivan was argued the same day as this\r\ncase, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certio\r\nrari in Sullivan as improvidently granted. Post, p. ___.\r\nThe facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida’s\r\nsystem. The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as\r\nan adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13\r\nyears old. Noting Sullivan’s past encounters with the law,\r\nthe sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan\r\nhad been “given opportunity after opportunity to upright\r\nhimself and take advantage of the second and third\r\nchances he’s been given,” he had demonstrated himself to\r\nbe unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away\r\nfrom society for the duration of his life. Brief for Respon\r\ndent in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009, No. 08–7621, p. 6.\r\nThe judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. As\r\nthese examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing\r\nthe imposition of these sentences based only on a discre\r\ntionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the\r\noffender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to\r\nprevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life\r\nwithout parole sentence for which he or she lacks the\r\nmoral culpability.\r\n   Another possible approach would be to hold that the\r\nEighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender’s\r\nage into consideration as part of a case-specific gross\r\ndisproportionality inquiry, weighing it against the seri\r\nousness of the crime. This approach would allow courts to\r\naccount for factual differences between cases and to im\r\npose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more\r\ndifficult than sentencing. The task is usually undertaken\r\nby trial judges who seek with diligence and professional\r\nism to take account of the human existence of the offender\r\nand the just demands of a wronged society.\r\n   The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however,\r\nbe confined by some boundaries. The dilemma of juvenile\r\nsentencing demonstrates this. For even if we were to\r\nassume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might\r\nhave “sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same\r\ntime demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,” Roper, 543 U. S.,\r\nat 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not\r\nfollow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality\r\napproach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the\r\nfew incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that\r\nhave the capacity for change. Roper rejected the argument\r\nthat the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be\r\ntold they must consider the defendant’s age as a mitigat\r\ning factor in sentencing. The Court concluded that an\r\n“unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold\r\nblooded nature of any particular crime would overpower\r\nmitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of\r\ncourse, even where the juvenile offender’s objective imma\r\nturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should\r\nrequire a sentence less severe than death.” Id., at 573.\r\nHere, as with the death penalty, “[t]he differences between\r\njuvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well\r\nunderstood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive” a\r\nsentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime\r\n“despite insufficient culpability.” Id., at 572–573.\r\n   Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it\r\ndoes not take account of special difficulties encountered by\r\ncounsel in juvenile representation. As some amici note,\r\nthe features that distinguish juveniles from adults also\r\nput them at a significant disadvantage in criminal pro\r\nceedings. Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited\r\n28                  GRAHAM v.

They are less\r\nlikely than adults to work effectively with their lawyers to\r\naid in their defense.

Rev. 245, 272–273 (2005). Diffi\r\nculty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding\r\nimpulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel\r\nseen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects,\r\nall can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juve\r\nnile offense. Aber Brief 35. These factors are likely to\r\nimpair the quality of a juvenile defendant’s representa\r\ntion. Cf. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320 (“Mentally retarded\r\ndefendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance\r\nto their counsel”). A categorical rule avoids the risk that,\r\nas a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will errone\r\nously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently\r\nculpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.\r\n   Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.\r\nThe juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to\r\nachieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of hu\r\nman worth and potential. In Roper, that deprivation\r\nresulted from an execution that brought life to its end.\r\nHere, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns\r\napply. Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives\r\nno chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance\r\nfor reconciliation with society, no hope. Maturity can lead\r\nto that considered reflection which is the foundation for\r\nremorse, renewal, and rehabilitation. A young person who\r\nknows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before\r\nlife’s end has little incentive to become a responsible indi\r\nvidual. In some prisons, moreover, the system itself be\r\ncomes complicit in the lack of development. As noted\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            29\r\n\r\n                 Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nabove, see supra, at 23, it is the policy in some prisons to\r\nwithhold counseling, education, and rehabilitation pro\r\ngrams for those who are ineligible for parole consideration.\r\nA categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders avoids the perverse consequence in\r\nwhich the lack of maturity that led to an offender’s crime\r\nis reinforced by the prison term.\r\n   Terrance Graham’s sentence guarantees he will die in\r\nprison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain\r\nrelease, no matter what he might do to demonstrate that\r\nthe bad acts he committed as a teenager are not represen\r\ntative of his true character, even if he spends the next half\r\ncentury attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from\r\nhis mistakes. The State has denied him any chance to\r\nlater demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based\r\nsolely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he\r\nwas a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth\r\nAmendment does not permit.\r\n                                D\r\n   There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in\r\ncontinuing to impose life without parole sentences on\r\njuveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States\r\nadheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.\r\nThis observation does not control our decision. The judg\r\nments of other nations and the international community\r\nare not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth\r\nAmendment. But “ ‘[t]he climate of international opinion\r\nconcerning the acceptability of a particular punishment’ ”\r\nis also “ ‘not irrelevant.’ ” Enmund, 458 U. S., at 796, n. 22.\r\nThe Court has looked beyond our Nation’s borders for\r\nsupport for its independent conclusion that a particular\r\npunishment is cruel and unusual. See, e.g., Roper, 543\r\nU. S., at 575–578; Atkins, supra, at 317–318, n. 21;\r\nThompson, 487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); Enmund,\r\nsupra, at 796–797, n. 22; Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10\r\n30                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n(plurality opinion); Trop, 356 U. S., at 102–103 (plurality\r\nopinion).\r\n   Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting\r\nthe global consensus against the sentencing practice in\r\nquestion. A recent study concluded that only 11 nations\r\nauthorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under\r\nany circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States\r\nand Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice. See\r\nM. Leighton & C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to\r\nDie in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An up\r\ndated version of the study concluded that Israel’s “laws\r\nallow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life\r\nterms,” but expressed reservations about how that parole\r\nreview is implemented. De la Vega & Leighton, Sentenc\r\ning Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Prac\r\ntice, 42 U. S. F. L. Rev. 983, 1002–1003 (2008). But even if\r\nIsrael is counted as allowing life without parole for juve\r\nnile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that\r\nsentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli\r\nprisoners whom commentators have identified as serving\r\nlife sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homi\r\ncide or attempted homicide. See Amnesty International,\r\nHuman Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life with\r\nout Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 106,\r\nn. 322 (2005); Memorandum and Attachment from Ruth\r\nLevush, Law Library of Congress, to Supreme Court Li\r\nbrary (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case\r\nfile).\r\n   Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not\r\ncontest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes\r\nlife without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders. We also note, as petitioner and his amici em\r\nphasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Conven\r\ntion on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577\r\nU. N. T. S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by\r\nevery nation except the United States and Somalia, pro\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 577.\r\n   The State’s amici stress that no international legal\r\nagreement that is binding on the United States prohibits\r\nlife without parole for juvenile offenders and thus urge us\r\nto ignore the international consensus. See Brief for Soli\r\ndarity Center for Law and Justice et al. as Amici Curiae\r\n14–16; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House\r\nof Representatives as Amici Curiae 40–43. These argu\r\nments miss the mark. The question before us is not\r\nwhether international law prohibits the United States\r\nfrom imposing the sentence at issue in this case. The\r\nquestion is whether that punishment is cruel and unusual.\r\nIn that inquiry, “the overwhelming weight of international\r\nopinion against” life without parole for nonhomicide of\r\nfenses committed by juveniles “provide[s] respected and\r\nsignificant confirmation for our own conclusions.” Roper,\r\nsupra, at 578.\r\n   The debate between petitioner’s and respondent’s amici\r\nover whether there is a binding jus cogens norm against\r\nthis sentencing practice is likewise of no import. See Brief\r\nfor Amnesty International 10–23; Brief for Sixteen Mem\r\nbers of United States House of Representatives 4–40. The\r\nCourt has treated the laws and practices of other nations\r\nand international agreements as relevant to the Eighth\r\nAmendment not because those norms are binding or con\r\ntrolling but because the judgment of the world’s nations\r\nthat a particular sentencing practice is inconsistent with\r\nbasic principles of decency demonstrates that the Court’s\r\nrationale has respected reasoning to support it.\r\n32                  GRAHAM v.

A State need not guarantee the offender\r\neventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must\r\nprovide him or her with some realistic opportunity to\r\nobtain release before the end of that term. The judgment\r\nof the First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirming\r\nGraham’s conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                   It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Given that “evolving\r\nstandards of decency” have played a central role in our\r\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence for at least a century,\r\nsee Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373–378 (1910),\r\nthis argument suggests the dissenting opinions in those\r\ncases more accurately describe the law today than does\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS’ rigid interpretation of the Amendment.\r\nSociety changes. Knowledge accumulates. We learn,\r\nsometimes, from our mistakes. Punishments that did not\r\nseem cruel and unusual at one time may, in the light of\r\nreason and experience, be found cruel and unusual at a\r\nlater time; unless we are to abandon the moral commit\r\nment embodied in the Eighth Amendment, proportionality\r\nreview must never become effectively obsolete, post, at\r\n8–9, and n. 2.\r\n   While JUSTICE THOMAS would apparently not rule out a\r\ndeath sentence for a $50 theft by a 7-year-old, see post, at\r\n4, 10, n. 3, the Court wisely rejects his static approach to\r\n2                 GRAHAM v.

Instead, my analysis is based on an applica\r\ntion of this Court’s precedents, in particular (1) our cases\r\nrequiring “narrow proportionality” review of noncapital\r\nsentences and (2) our conclusion in Roper v. Simmons, 543\r\nU. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less\r\nculpable than adults who commit the same crimes.\r\n   These cases expressly allow courts addressing allega\r\ntions that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment to consider the particular defendant and\r\nparticular crime at issue. The standards for relief under\r\nthese precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here\r\nGraham’s juvenile status—together with the nature of his\r\ncriminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punish\r\nment imposed—lead me to conclude that his sentence of\r\nlife without parole is unconstitutional.\r\n                           I\r\n  Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply\r\nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences\r\n2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nfor noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised\r\nserious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an\r\noriginal matter, the Constitution was understood to re\r\nquire any degree of proportionality between noncapital\r\noffenses and their corresponding punishments. See, e.g.,\r\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 962–994 (1991)\r\n(principal opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 3–5, and n. 1\r\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to\r\nreexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality,\r\nhowever, and so I approach this case by trying to apply\r\nour past decisions to the facts at hand.\r\n                              A\r\n   Graham’s case arises at the intersection of two lines of\r\nEighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of deci\r\nsions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\r\nClause embraces a “narrow proportionality principle” that\r\nwe apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review\r\nnoncapital sentences. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 72\r\n(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Solem v. Helm,\r\n463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); Ewing v. California, 538 U. S.\r\n11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 996–\r\n997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\r\njudgment). This “narrow proportionality principle” does\r\nnot grant judges blanket authority to second-guess deci\r\nsions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the\r\ncontrary, a reviewing court will only “rarely” need “to\r\nengage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence\r\nis not constitutionally disproportionate,” Solem, supra, at\r\n290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and “successful challenges” to\r\nnoncapital sentences will be all the more “exceedingly\r\nrare,” Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).\r\n   We have “not established a clear or consistent path for\r\ncourts to follow” in applying the highly deferential “narrow\r\nproportionality” analysis. Lockyer, supra, at 72. We have,\r\nhowever, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsetting sentences, the variety of legitimate penological\r\nschemes, the state-by-state diversity protected by our\r\nfederal system, and the requirement that review be guided\r\nby objective, rather than subjective, factors. Ewing, supra,\r\nat 23 (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 998–1001\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Most importantly, however, we\r\nhave explained that the Eighth Amendment “ ‘does not\r\nrequire strict proportionality between crime and sen\r\ntence’ ”; rather, “ ‘it forbids only extreme sentences that are\r\n“grossly disproportionate” to the crime.’ ” Ewing, supra, at\r\n23 (plurality opinion) (quoting Harmelin, supra, at 1001\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)).\r\n   Our cases indicate that courts conducting “narrow pro\r\nportionality” review should begin with a threshold inquiry\r\nthat compares “the gravity of the offense and the harsh\r\nness of the penalty.” Solem, 463 U. S., at 290–291. This\r\nanalysis can consider a particular offender’s mental state\r\nand motive in committing the crime, the actual harm\r\ncaused to his victim or to society by his conduct, and any\r\nprior criminal history. Id., at 292–294, 296–297, and n. 22\r\n(considering motive, past criminal conduct, alcoholism,\r\nand propensity for violence of the particular defendant);\r\nsee also Ewing, supra, at 28–30 (plurality opinion) (exam\r\nining defendant’s criminal history); Harmelin, 501 U. S.,\r\nat 1001–1004 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (noting specific\r\ndetails of the particular crime of conviction).\r\n   Only in “the rare case in which a threshold comparison\r\nof the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads\r\nto an inference of gross disproportionality,” id., at 1005,\r\nshould courts proceed to an “intrajurisdictional” compari\r\nson of the sentence at issue with those imposed on other\r\ncriminals in the same jurisdiction, and an “interjurisdic\r\ntional” comparison with sentences imposed for the same\r\ncrime in other jurisdictions. Solem, supra, at 291–292. If\r\nthese subsequent comparisons confirm the inference of\r\ngross disproportionality, courts should invalidate the\r\n4                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsentence as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\r\n                              B\r\n   The second line of precedent relevant to assessing Gra\r\nham’s sentence consists of our cases acknowledging that\r\njuvenile offenders are generally—though not necessarily in\r\nevery case—less morally culpable than adults who commit\r\nthe same crimes. This insight animated our decision in\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we\r\ninvalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who\r\nhad committed his crime under the age of 16. More re\r\ncently, in Roper, 543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibi\r\ntion on executions to those who committed their crimes\r\nbefore the age of 18.\r\n   Both Thompson and Roper arose in the unique context\r\nof the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has\r\nrecognized “must be limited to those offenders who commit\r\n‘a narrow category of the most serious crimes’ and whose\r\nextreme culpability makes them ‘the most deserving of\r\nexecution.’ ” 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia,\r\n536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). Roper’s prohibition on the\r\njuvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that\r\n“[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18\r\nand adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot\r\nwith reliability be classified among the worst offenders.”\r\n543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity\r\nand an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a height\r\nened susceptibility to negative influences and outside\r\npressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is\r\n“more transitory” and “less fixed” than that of an adult.\r\nId., at 569–570. Together, these factors establish the\r\n“diminished culpability of juveniles,” id., at 571, and “ren\r\nder suspect any conclusion” that juveniles are among “the\r\nworst offenders” for whom the death penalty is reserved,\r\nid., at 570.\r\n   Today, the Court views Roper as providing the basis for\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\na new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a\r\nsentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes. I\r\ndisagree. In Roper, the Court tailored its analysis of\r\njuvenile characteristics to the specific question whether\r\njuvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to\r\ncapital punishment. Our answer that they could not be\r\nsentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion\r\nthat they “cannot with reliability be classified among the\r\nworst offenders.” Id., at 569 (emphasis added).\r\n  This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can\r\nnever be eligible for life without parole. A life sentence is\r\nof course far less severe than a death sentence, and we\r\nhave never required that it be imposed only on the very\r\nworst offenders, as we have with capital punishment.\r\nTreating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital\r\npunishment is at odds with our longstanding view that\r\n“the death penalty is different from other punishments in\r\nkind rather than degree.” Solem, supra, at 294. It is also\r\nat odds with Roper itself, which drew the line at capital\r\npunishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are “less\r\nsevere than death” despite involving “forfeiture of some of\r\nthe most basic liberties.” 543 U. S., at 573–574. Indeed,\r\nRoper explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life\r\nwithout parole on some juvenile offenders. Id., at 572.\r\n  But the fact that Roper does not support a categorical\r\nrule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean\r\nthat a criminal defendant’s age is irrelevant to those\r\nsentences. On the contrary, our cases establish that the\r\n“narrow proportionality” review applicable to noncapital\r\ncases itself takes the personal “culpability of the offender”\r\ninto account in examining whether a given punishment is\r\nproportionate to the crime. Solem, supra, at 292. There\r\nis no reason why an offender’s juvenile status should be\r\nexcluded from the analysis. Indeed, given Roper’s conclu\r\nsion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than\r\nadults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender’s juvenile status can\r\n6                        GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nplay a central role in the inquiry.\r\n   JUSTICE THOMAS disagrees with even our limited reli\r\nance on Roper on the ground that the present case does\r\nnot involve capital punishment. Post, at 26 (dissenting\r\nopinion). That distinction is important—indeed, it under\r\nlies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the\r\nCourt. But Roper’s conclusion that juveniles are typically\r\nless culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital\r\ncases, and rightly informs the case-specific inquiry I be\r\nlieve to be appropriate here.\r\n   In short, our existing precedent already provides a\r\nsufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined\r\nby the majority. Not every juvenile receiving a life sen\r\ntence will prevail under this approach. Not every juvenile\r\nshould. But all will receive the protection that the Eighth\r\nAmendment requires.\r\n                            II\r\n  Applying the “narrow proportionality” framework to the\r\nparticular facts of this case, I conclude that Graham’s\r\nsentence of life without parole violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment.*\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   * JUSTICE ALITO suggests that Graham has failed to preserve any\r\nchallenge to his sentence based on the “narrow, as-applied proportional\r\nity principle.” Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. It is true that\r\nGraham asks us to declare, categorically, that no juvenile convicted of a\r\nnonhomicide offense may ever be subject to a sentence of life without\r\nparole. But he claims that this rule is warranted under the narrow\r\nproportionality principle we set forth in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277\r\n(1983), Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), and Ewing v.\r\nCalifornia, 538 U. S. 11 (2003). Brief for Petitioner 30, 31, 54–64.\r\nInsofar as he relies on that framework, I believe we may do so as well,\r\neven if our analysis results in a narrower holding than the categori-\r\ncal rule Graham seeks. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8\r\n(“[T]he Court could rule narrowly in this case and hold only that\r\npetitioner’s sentence of life without parole was unconstitutionally\r\ndisproportionate”).\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n   I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity\r\nof Graham’s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.\r\nThere is no question that the crime for which Graham\r\nreceived his life sentence—armed burglary of a nondomicil\r\nwith an assault or battery—is “a serious crime deserving\r\nserious punishment.” Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,\r\n797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was\r\nthe basis of Graham’s probation violation. But these\r\ncrimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such\r\nas murder or rape.\r\n   As for Graham’s degree of personal culpability, he com\r\nmitted the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile—a\r\nstage at which, Roper emphasized, one’s “culpability or\r\nblameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by\r\nreason of youth and immaturity.” 543 U. S., at 571. Gra\r\nham’s age places him in a significantly different category\r\nfrom the defendants in Rummel, Harmelin, and Ewing, all\r\nof whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham’s\r\nyouth made him relatively more likely to engage in reck\r\nless and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also\r\nlikely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See,\r\ne.g., Roper, supra, at 569; Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,\r\n367 (1993); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115–117\r\n(1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should\r\nbe denied the general presumption of diminished culpabil\r\nity that Roper indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.\r\nIf anything, Graham’s in-court statements—including his\r\nrequest for a second chance so that he could “do whatever\r\nit takes to get to the NFL”—underscore his immaturity.\r\nApp. 380.\r\n   The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did\r\nproves that he was dangerous and deserved to be pun\r\nished. But it does not establish that he was particularly\r\ndangerous—at least relative to the murderers and rapists\r\nfor whom the sentence of life without parole is typically\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nreserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal con\r\nvictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult cir\r\ncumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, ante,\r\nat 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a\r\ntypical adult who commits the same offenses.\r\n   Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced\r\nGraham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\r\nThis is the second-harshest sentence available under our\r\nprecedents for any crime, and the most severe sanction\r\navailable for a nonhomicide offense. See Kennedy v. Lou\r\nisiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes,\r\nGraham’s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed\r\nby the Florida Department of Corrections (which sug\r\ngested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20),\r\nand the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced\r\nto 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).\r\nNo one in Graham’s case other than the sentencing judge\r\nappears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to\r\nprison for life.\r\n   Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that\r\nthere is a strong inference that Graham’s sentence of life\r\nimprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate\r\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed\r\nto the next steps of the proportionality analysis.\r\n                              B\r\n   Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional compari\r\nsons of Graham’s sentence confirm the threshold inference\r\nof disproportionality.\r\n   Graham’s sentence was far more severe than that im\r\nposed for similar violations of Florida law, even without\r\ntaking juvenile status into account. For example, indi\r\nviduals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Flor\r\nida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less\r\nthan 10 years, respectively. Florida Dept. of Corrections,\r\nAnnual Report FY 2007–2008: The Guidebook to Correc\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\ntions in Florida 35. Unsurprisingly, Florida’s juvenile\r\ncriminals receive similarly low sentences—typically less\r\nthan five years for burglary and less than seven years for\r\nrobbery. Id., at 36. Graham’s life without parole sentence\r\nwas far more severe than the average sentence imposed on\r\nthose convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically\r\nreceive under 25 years in prison. Id., at 35. As the Court\r\nexplained in Solem, 463 U. S., at 291, “[i]f more serious\r\ncrimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious\r\npenalties, that is some indication that the punishment at\r\nissue may be excessive.”\r\n   Finally, the inference that Graham’s sentence is dispro\r\nportionate is further validated by comparison to the sen\r\ntences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions. As the\r\nmajority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its will\r\ningness to impose sentences of life without parole on juve\r\nniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes. See ante, at 11–13.\r\n                              III\r\n  So much for Graham. But what about Milagro Cun\r\nningham, a 17-year-old who beat and raped an 8-year-old\r\ngirl before leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rock in a\r\nrecycling bin in a remote landfill? See Musgrave, Cruel or\r\nNecessary? Life Terms for Youths Spur National Debate,\r\nPalm Beach Post, Oct. 15, 2009, p. 1A. Or Nathan Walker\r\nand Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together\r\nwith their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to\r\nperform oral sex on her 12-year-old son? See 3 Sentenced\r\nto Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,\r\n2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life\r\nwithout parole for his conduct says nothing whatever\r\nabout these offenders, or others like them who commit\r\nnonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the\r\nconduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham’s case as a\r\nvehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule—applicable\r\nwell beyond the particular facts of Graham’s case—that a\r\n10                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsentence of life without parole imposed on any juvenile for\r\nany nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional. This cate\r\ngorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.\r\n   A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particu\r\nlar conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before\r\nus are not serious enough to justify Graham’s sentence.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court\r\nto decide whether that same sentence would be constitu\r\ntional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide\r\ncrimes.\r\n   A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in\r\nlight of the Court’s apparent recognition that it is perfectly\r\nlegitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life with\r\nout parole for committing murder. This means that there\r\nis nothing inherently unconstitutional about imposing\r\nsentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders;\r\nrather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on\r\nthe particular crimes for which they are imposed. But if\r\nthe constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particu\r\nlar crime being punished, then the Court should limit its\r\nholding to the particular offenses that Graham committed\r\nhere, and should decline to consider other hypothetical\r\ncrimes not presented by this case.\r\n   In any event, the Court’s categorical conclusion is also\r\nunwise. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some\r\nnonhomicide crimes—like the ones committed by Milagro\r\nCunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor—are\r\nespecially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserv\r\ning of more severe punishment.\r\n   Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have\r\n“diminished” culpability relative to adults who commit the\r\nsame crimes, Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, but that does not\r\nmean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify\r\na life sentence. See generally Thompson, 487 U. S., at 853\r\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nknow that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leav\r\ning her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong.\r\nThe single fact of being 17 years old would not afford\r\nCunningham protection against life without parole if the\r\nyoung girl had died—as Cunningham surely expected she\r\nwould—so why should it do so when she miraculously\r\nsurvived his barbaric brutality?\r\n   The Court defends its categorical approach on the\r\ngrounds that a “clear line is necessary to prevent the\r\npossibility that life without parole sentences will be im\r\nposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not\r\nsufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.” Ante, at\r\n24. It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportional\r\nity review is constitutionally insufficient because courts\r\nmight not be able “with sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish\r\nthe few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that\r\nhave the capacity for change.” Ante, at 27.\r\n   The Court is of course correct that judges will never\r\nhave perfect foresight—or perfect wisdom—in making\r\nsentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence\r\nadults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is\r\nalso true when they sentence juveniles who commit mur\r\nder no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit\r\nother crimes.\r\n   Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying\r\ntheir reasoned judgment to each case that comes before\r\nthem. As we explained in Solem, the whole enterprise of\r\nproportionality review is premised on the “justified” as\r\nsumption that “courts are competent to judge the gravity\r\nof an offense, at least on a relative scale.” 463 U. S., at\r\n292. Indeed, “courts traditionally have made these judg\r\nments” by applying “generally accepted criteria” to analyze\r\n“the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society,\r\nand the culpability of the offender.” Id., at 292, 294.\r\n12                  GRAHAM v.

J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\n                         *     *   *\r\n   Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which\r\nhe deserves serious punishment. But he was only 16 years\r\nold, and under our Court’s precedents, his youth is one\r\nfactor, among others, that should be considered in decid\r\ning whether his punishment was unconstitutionally exces\r\nsive. In my view, Graham’s age—together with the nature\r\nof his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his\r\nsentence—tips the constitutional balance. I thus concur in\r\nthe Court’s judgment that Graham’s sentence of life with\r\nout parole violated the Eighth Amendment.\r\n   I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in\r\nevery case involving a juvenile offender. Some crimes are\r\nso heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable,\r\nthat a sentence of life without parole may be entirely\r\njustified under the Constitution. As we have said, “suc\r\ncessful challenges” to noncapital sentences under the\r\nEighth Amendment have been—and, in my view, should\r\ncontinue to be—“exceedingly rare.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at\r\n272. But Graham’s sentence presents the exceptional case\r\nthat our precedents have recognized will come along. We\r\nshould grant Graham the relief to which he is entitled\r\nunder the Eighth Amendment. The Court errs, however,\r\nin using this case as a vehicle for unsettling our estab\r\nlished jurisprudence and fashioning a categorical rule\r\napplicable to far different cases.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Congress, the District of\r\nColumbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to con\r\nsider this sentencing practice in juvenile nonhomicide\r\ncases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it in\r\nthe very worst cases they have encountered.\r\n   The Court does not conclude that life without parole\r\nitself is a cruel and unusual punishment. It instead re\r\njects the judgments of those legislatures, judges, and\r\njuries regarding what the Court describes as the “moral”\r\nquestion of whether this sentence can ever be “propor\r\ntionat[e]” when applied to the category of offenders at\r\n2                   GRAHAM v.

Nothing in our training as\r\njudges qualifies us for that task, and nothing in Article III\r\ngives us that authority.\r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n   The Court recounts the facts of Terrance Jamar Gra\r\nham’s case in detail, so only a summary is necessary here.\r\nAt age 16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked\r\naccomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida\r\nrestaurant, during which one of Graham’s accomplices\r\ntwice struck the restaurant manager on the head with a\r\nsteel pipe when he refused to turn over money to the\r\nintruders. Graham was arrested and charged as an adult.\r\nHe later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including armed\r\nburglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable by\r\nlife imprisonment under Florida law.           Fla. Stat.\r\n§§810.02(2)(a), 810.02(2)(b) (2007). The trial court with\r\nheld adjudication on both counts, however, and sentenced\r\nGraham to probation, the first 12 months of which he\r\nspent in a county detention facility.\r\n   Graham reoffended just six months after his release. At\r\na probation revocation hearing, a judge found by a pre\r\nponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11\r\nmonths, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices\r\nand held the homeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30\r\nminutes while his accomplices ransacked the residence.\r\nAs a result, the judge concluded that Graham had violated\r\nhis probation and, after additional hearings, adjudicated\r\nGraham guilty on both counts arising from the restaurant\r\nrobbery.

Brief for Petitioner 24; ante, at 21.\r\n                             II \r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n    The Eighth Amendment, which applies to the States\r\nthrough the Fourteenth, provides that “[e]xcessive bail\r\nshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor\r\ncruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” It is by now\r\nwell established that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\r\nClause was originally understood as prohibiting torturous\r\n“ ‘methods of punishment,’ ” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501\r\nU. S. 957, 979 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (quoting\r\nGranucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments In\r\nflicted”: The Original Meaning, 57 Cal. L. Rev. 839, 842\r\n(1969))—specifically methods akin to those that had been\r\nconsidered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of\r\nRights was adopted, Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008)\r\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable\r\nexception, see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349\r\n(1910); Harmelin, supra, at 990–994 (opinion of\r\nSCALIA, J.) (discussing the scope and relevance of Weems’\r\nholding), this Court applied the Clause with that under\r\nstanding for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amend\r\nment’s ratification.\r\n   More recently, however, the Court has held that the\r\nClause authorizes it to proscribe not only methods of\r\npunishment that qualify as “cruel and unusual,” but also\r\nany punishment that the Court deems “grossly dispropor\r\ntionate” to the crime committed. Ante, at 8 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). This latter interpretation is\r\n4                       GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nentirely the Court’s creation. As has been described else\r\nwhere at length, there is virtually no indication that the\r\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause originally was\r\nunderstood to require proportionality in sentencing. See\r\nHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 975–985 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\r\nHere, it suffices to recall just two points. First, the Clause\r\ndoes not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any\r\nsynonym for that term, even though the Framers were\r\nfamiliar with the concept, as evidenced by several found\r\ning-era state constitutions that required (albeit without\r\ndefining) proportional punishments. See id., at 977–978.\r\nIn addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Con\r\ngress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was\r\nnot considered a constitutional command.1 See id., at\r\n980–981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital pun\r\nishment for offenses ranging from “ ‘run[ning] away with\r\n. . . goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars,’ ” to\r\n“murder on the high seas” (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also\r\nPreyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An\r\nOverview, 26 Am.

I disagree. Both the Court and\r\nthe concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality\r\nprecedents to the particulars of Graham’s claim. The Court radically\r\ndeparts from the framework those precedents establish by applying to a\r\nnoncapital sentence the categorical proportionality review its prior\r\ndecisions have reserved for death penalty cases alone. See Part III,\r\ninfra. The concurrence, meanwhile, breathes new life into the case-by\r\ncase proportionality approach that previously governed noncapital\r\ncases, from which the Court has steadily, and wisely, retreated since\r\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). See Part IV, infra. In dissenting\r\nfrom both choices to expand proportionality review, I find it essential to\r\nreexamine the foundations on which that doctrine is built.\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opin\r\nion) (rape of an adult woman); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554\r\nU. S. ___ (2008) (rape of a child); Enmund v. Florida, 458\r\nU. S. 782 (1982) (felony murder in which the defendant\r\nparticipated in the felony but did not kill or intend to kill);\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988) (plurality\r\nopinion) (juveniles under 16); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.\r\n551 (2005) (juveniles under 18); Atkins v. Virginia, 536\r\nU. S. 304 (2002) (mentally retarded offenders). In adopting\r\nthese categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes\r\nupon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state\r\nand federal) organs of government. The Eighth Amend\r\nment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and\r\nunusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other\r\nconstitutional provisions ensure the defendant’s right to\r\nfair process before any punishment is imposed. But, as\r\nmembers of today’s majority note, “[s]ociety changes,” ante,\r\nat 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment\r\nleaves the unavoidably moral question of who “deserves” a\r\nparticular nonprohibited method of punishment to the\r\njudgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the\r\nprosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that\r\nimpose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.\r\n   The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules\r\nthat shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from\r\nthe death penalty on the theory that “evolving standards\r\nof decency” require this result. Ante, at 7 (internal quota\r\ntion marks omitted). The Court has offered assurances\r\nthat these standards can be reliably measured by “ ‘objec\r\n6                    GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntive indicia’ ” of “national consensus,” such as state and\r\nfederal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given\r\nthat we are talking about “national” consensus) interna\r\ntional opinion. Ante, at 10 (quoting Roper, supra, at 563);\r\nsee also ante, at 10–16, 29–31. Yet even assuming that is\r\ntrue, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality\r\nof a particular type of punishment to turn on a “snapshot\r\nof American public opinion” taken at the moment a case\r\nis decided. Roper, supra, at 629 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\nBy holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one\r\ndirection the evolution of the standards it describes, thus\r\n“calling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pen\r\ndulum swing in social attitudes,” Thompson, supra, at\r\n869 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and “stunt[ing] legislative\r\nconsideration” of new questions of penal policy as they\r\nemerge, Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (ALITO, J.,\r\ndissenting).\r\n   But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of\r\ncommunity consensus in any event. Ante, at 16 (“Commu\r\nnity consensus, while ‘entitled to great weight,’ is not itself\r\ndeterminative” (quoting Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at\r\n24))). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence\r\nof consensus it finds whenever its own “independent judg\r\nment” points in a different direction. Ante, at 16. The\r\nCourt thus openly claims the power not only to approve or\r\ndisapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on\r\nevidence of how society’s standards have evolved, but also\r\non the basis of the Court’s “independent” perception of\r\nhow those standards should evolve, which depends on\r\nwhat the Court concedes is “ ‘ “necessarily . . . a moral\r\njudgment” ’ ” regarding the propriety of a given punish\r\nment in today’s society. Ante, at 7 (quoting Kennedy,\r\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).\r\n   The categorical proportionality review the Court em\r\nploys in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.\r\nThe Court’s decision today is significant because it does\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

For the first time in its history, the Court declares\r\nan entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital\r\nsentence using the categorical approach it previously\r\nreserved for death penalty cases alone.\r\n                                B\r\n   Until today, the Court has based its categorical propor\r\ntionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives\r\nspecial protection to capital defendants because the death\r\npenalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be\r\nreserved for only those who are “most deserving of execu\r\ntion.” Atkins, supra, at 319; see Roper, supra, at 568;\r\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v.\r\nOhio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).           Of course, the Eighth\r\nAmendment itself makes no distinction between capital\r\nand noncapital sentencing, but the “ ‘bright line’ ” the\r\nCourt drew between the two penalties has for many years\r\nserved as the principal justification for the Court’s will\r\ningness to reject democratic choices regarding the death\r\npenalty. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).\r\n   Today’s decision eviscerates that distinction. “Death is\r\ndifferent” no longer. The Court now claims not only the\r\npower categorically to reserve the “most severe punish\r\nment” for those the Court thinks are “ ‘the most deserving\r\nof execution,’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins,\r\n536 U. S., at 319), but also to declare that “less culpable”\r\npersons are categorically exempt from the “second most\r\nsevere penalty.” Ante, at 21 (emphasis added). No reli\r\nable limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from\r\nimmunizing any class of offenders from the law’s third,\r\nfourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.\r\n   The Court’s departure from the “death is different”\r\ndistinction is especially mystifying when one considers\r\nhow long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a\r\ntime the Court declined to apply proportionality principles\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nto noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that “a sen\r\ntence of death differs in kind from any sentence of impris\r\nonment, no matter how long.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at 272\r\n(emphasis added). Based on that rationale, the Court\r\nfound that the excessiveness of one prison term as com\r\npared to another was “properly within the province of\r\nlegislatures, not courts,” id., at 275–276, precisely because\r\nit involved an “invariably . . . subjective determination,\r\nthere being no clear way to make ‘any constitutional dis\r\ntinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer\r\nterm of years,’ ” Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370, 373 (1982)\r\n(per curiam) (quoting Rummel, supra, at 275; emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n   Even when the Court broke from that understanding in\r\nits 5-to-4 decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983)\r\n(striking down as “grossly disproportionate” a life-without\r\nparole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a\r\nworthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the\r\nfacts of that case; it announced no categorical rule. Id., at\r\n288, 303. Moreover, the Court soon cabined Solem’s ra\r\ntionale. The controlling opinion in the Court’s very next\r\nnoncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles\r\nof federalism require substantial deference to legislative\r\nchoices regarding the proper length of prison sentences.\r\nHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\r\n(“[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of\r\nsentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms\r\nare the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal\r\nstructure”); id., at 1000 (“[D]iffering attitudes and percep\r\ntions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational,\r\nconclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison\r\nterms for particular crimes”). That opinion thus concluded\r\nthat “successful challenges to the proportionality of\r\n[prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.” Id., at\r\n1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years since\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nSolem, the Court has considered just three such chal\r\nlenges and has rejected them all, see Ewing v. California,\r\n538 U. S. 11 (2003); Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63\r\n(2003); Harmelin, supra, largely on the theory that criti\r\ncisms of the “wisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness” of\r\nterm-of-years prison sentences are “appropriately directed\r\nat the legislature[s],” not the courts, Ewing, supra, at 27,\r\n28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that\r\nthose decisions were “closely divided,” ante, at 8, but so\r\nwas Solem itself, and it is now fair to describe Solem as an\r\noutlier.2\r\n   Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to\r\nSolem’s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapi\r\ntal sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a categorical\r\nproportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences\r\nnot just in this case, but in every case involving a juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.\r\nNeither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court’s prece\r\ndents justify this decision.\r\n                            III\r\n  The Court asserts that categorical proportionality re\r\nview is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a\r\ncategorical rule, see ante, at 10, and because the Court\r\n——————\r\n  2 Courts  and commentators interpreting this Court’s decisions have\r\nreached this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Polk, 546 F. 3d 74,\r\n76 (CA1 2008) (“[I]nstances of gross disproportionality [in noncapital\r\ncases] will be hen’s-teeth rare”); Barkow, The Court of Life and Death:\r\nThe Two Tracks of Constitutional Sentencing Law and the Case for\r\nUniformity, 107 Mich.

I find\r\nthose factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court’s\r\nbreak from past practice. First, the Court fails to ac\r\nknowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire\r\ncategory of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a\r\nmuch heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief\r\nunder Solem. Unlike the petitioner in Solem, Graham\r\nmust establish not only that his own life-without-parole\r\nsentence is “grossly disproportionate,” but also that such a\r\nsentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is\r\napplied to a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how\r\nheinous his crime. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.\r\n739 (1987). Second, even applying the Court’s categorical\r\n“evolving standards” test, neither objective evidence of\r\nnational consensus nor the notions of culpability on which\r\nthe Court’s “independent judgment” relies can justify the\r\ncategorical rule it declares here.\r\n                              A\r\n  According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment\r\nanalysis “begins with objective indicia of national consen\r\nsus,”3 and “[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evi\r\ndence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by\r\nthe country’s legislatures,” ante, at 10–11 (internal quota\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  3 The Court ignores entirely the threshold inquiry of whether subject\r\n\r\ning juvenile offenders to adult penalties was one of the “modes or acts of\r\npunishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time\r\nthat the Bill of Rights was adopted.” Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\r\n399, 405 (1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the\r\nevidence is clear that, at the time of the Founding, “the common law set\r\na rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the age\r\nof 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to be\r\nimposed on a person as young as age 7.” Stanford v. Kentucky, 492\r\nU. S. 361, 368 (1989) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *23–*24; 1\r\nM. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 24–29 (1800)). It thus seems exceedingly\r\nunlikely that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a\r\nperson of Graham’s age would run afoul of those standards.\r\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

As such, the analysis should end\r\nquickly, because a national “consensus” in favor of the\r\nCourt’s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50\r\nStates, the Federal Government, and the District of Co\r\nlumbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be\r\ntried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.4 See\r\nante, at 33–35 (Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty\r\nfive States, the Federal Government, and the District of\r\nColumbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court\r\nto the very same range of punishments faced by adults\r\ncharged with the same crimes. See ante, at 33–34, Part I.\r\nEight of those States do not make life-without-parole\r\nsentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regard\r\nless of age.5 All remaining jurisdictions—the Federal\r\nGovernment, the other 37 States, and the District—\r\nauthorize life-without-parole sentences for certain non\r\nhomicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such\r\nsentences on persons under 18. See ibid. Only five States\r\n——————\r\n  4 Although  the details of state laws vary extensively, they generally\r\npermit the transfer of a juvenile offender to adult court through one or\r\nmore of the following mechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the\r\njuvenile court has the authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender\r\nand transfer the case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in\r\nwhich adult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases\r\nand the prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3) statutory\r\nprovisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain crimes from\r\njuvenile-court jurisdiction. See Dept. of Justice, Juvenile Offenders and\r\nVictims: 1999 National Report 89, 104 (1999) (hereinafter 1999 DOJ\r\nNational Report); Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal\r\nResponsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J.

The sole fact that federal law author\r\nizes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our\r\nNation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality\r\nthat 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit\r\nthe practice makes the claim utterly implausible. Not only\r\nis there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear\r\nlegislative consensus in favor of its availability.\r\n    Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence\r\naside as “incomplete and unavailing,” declaring that\r\n“ ‘[t]here are measures of consensus other than legisla\r\ntion.’ ” Ante, at 11 (quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\r\nop., at 22)). This is nothing short of stunning. Most im\r\nportantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing\r\npractice.7 And although the Court has never decided how\r\nmany state laws are necessary to show consensus, the\r\nCourt has never banished into constitutional exile a sen\r\ntencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a\r\nsupermajority, of States expressly permit.8\r\n——————\r\n  6 Colo.

S., at 315–316; Roper, 543 U. S., at 565–566—\r\nunderscores the consensus against the rule the Court\r\nannounces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a\r\nnational consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a\r\nconsensus in favor of the two penological points it later\r\ndiscusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than\r\nsimilarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit\r\nnonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity\r\nto demonstrate rehabilitation through parole. Ante, at 17–\r\n18, 23–25. But legislative trends make that assumption\r\nuntenable.\r\n  First, States over the past 20 years have consistently\r\nincreased the severity of punishments for juvenile offend\r\ners. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the\r\n1990’s as “a time of unprecedented change as State legis\r\n——————\r\npunishment for the rape of a child where only six States had enacted\r\nstatutes authorizing the punishment since Furman v.

S. 551, 564,\r\n568 (2005) (prohibiting capital punishment for offenders younger than\r\n18 where 18 of 38 death-penalty States precluded imposition of the\r\npenalty on persons under 18 and the remaining 12 States did not\r\npermit capital punishment at all); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.

(noting\r\nthat, during that period, “legislatures in 47 States and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile\r\njustice systems more punitive,” principally by “ma[king] it\r\neasier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile\r\njustice system to the [adult] criminal justice system”); id.,\r\nat 104. This, in my view, reveals the States’ widespread\r\nagreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same\r\nculpability as adults and that the law should permit\r\njudges and juries to consider adult sentences—including\r\nlife without parole—in those rare and unfortunate cases.\r\nSee Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal\r\nResponsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law & Family\r\nStudies 11, 69–70 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole\r\nsentences for juveniles have increased since the 1980’s);\r\nAmnesty International & Human Rights Watch, The Rest\r\nof Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in\r\nthe United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).\r\n   Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over\r\nthe same period. Congress abolished parole for federal\r\noffenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to\r\n“gamesmanship and cynicism,” Breyer, Federal Sentenc\r\ning Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180\r\n(1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\r\nStat. 1987), and several States have followed suit, see T.\r\nHughes, D. Wilson, & A. Beck, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\r\nJustice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990–2000, p. 1\r\n(2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had\r\nabolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States\r\nhad abolished it for certain ones). In light of these devel\r\nopments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus\r\nthat parole must be available to offenders less than 18\r\nyears old in every nonhomicide case simply fails.\r\n                            B\r\n     The Court nonetheless dismisses existing legislation,\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Based on this rarity of\r\nuse, the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice,\r\nimplying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus\r\nof a prior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures\r\ntone-deaf to moral values of their constituents that this\r\nCourt claims to have easily discerned from afar. See ante,\r\nat 11.\r\n   This logic strains credulity. It has been rejected before.\r\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 182 (1976) (joint opinion\r\nof Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (“[T]he relative\r\n——————\r\n   9 I say “recent memory” because the research relied upon by the Court\r\n\r\nprovides a headcount of juvenile nonhomicide offenders presently\r\nincarcerated in this country, but does not provide more specific infor\r\nmation about all of the offenders, such as the dates on which they were\r\nconvicted.\r\n   10 When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a letter the Court had\r\n\r\nrequested from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which stated that there\r\nwere six juvenile nonhomicide offenders then serving life-without\r\nparole sentences in the federal system. After the Court released its\r\nopinion, the Acting Solicitor General disputed the BOP’s calculations\r\nand stated that none of those six offenders was serving a life without\r\nparole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime completed\r\nbefore the age of 18. See Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting\r\nSolicitor General, U. S. Dept. of Justice, to Clerk of the Supreme Court\r\n(May 24, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (noting that five\r\nof the six inmates were convicted for participation in unlawful con\r\nspiracies that began when they were juveniles but continued after they\r\nreached the age of 18, and noting that the sixth inmate was convicted of\r\nmurder as a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and\r\nCorrupt Organizations Act). The Court has amended its opinion in\r\nlight of the Acting Solicitor General’s letter. In my view, the inconsis\r\ntency between the BOP’s classification of these six offenders and the\r\nSolicitor General’s is irrelevant. The fact remains that federal law, and\r\nthe laws of a supermajority of States, permit this sentencing practice.\r\nAnd, as will be explained, see infra this page and 16–20, judges and\r\njurors have chosen to impose this sentence in the very worst cases they\r\nhave encountered.\r\n16                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ninfrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence\r\ndoes not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se.\r\nRather, [it] . . . may well reflect the humane feeling that\r\nthis most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a\r\nsmall number of extreme cases”). It should also be re\r\njected here. That a punishment is rarely imposed demon\r\nstrates nothing more than a general consensus that it\r\nshould be just that—rarely imposed. It is not proof that\r\nthe punishment is one the Nation abhors.\r\n   The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that\r\nauthorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating\r\na juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole\r\nsentence, cannot be counted as approving its use. The\r\nmere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this pen\r\nalty, the Court explains, “does not indicate that the pen\r\nalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and\r\nfull legislative consideration.” Ante, at 16.\r\n   But this misapplies the Court’s own evolving standards\r\ntest. Under that test, “[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to\r\nestablish a national consensus approving what their citi\r\nzens have voted to do; rather, it is the ‘heavy burden’ of\r\npetitioners to establish a national consensus against it.”\r\nStanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (quoting\r\nGregg, supra, at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\r\nSTEVENS, JJ.); some emphasis added). In light of this fact,\r\nthe Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction’s disuse of a\r\nlegislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition\r\nto it. The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this\r\nsentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the\r\ncitizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility\r\nthat a jury of their peers could impose a life-without\r\nparole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is\r\nsufficiently depraved.\r\n   The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illus\r\ntrates this point. Just weeks before the release of this\r\nopinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life with\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nout parole after hearing evidence that he viciously at\r\ntacked a 17-year-old girl who gave him a ride home from a\r\nparty. See Stogsdill, Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing,\r\nRape Case, Tulsa World, Apr. 2, 2010, p. A10; Stogsdill,\r\nDelaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case,\r\nTulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12. Budder allegedly put\r\nthe girl’s head “ ‘into a headlock and sliced her throat,’ ”\r\nraped her, stabbed her about 20 times, beat her, and\r\npounded her face into the rocks alongside a dirt road.\r\nTeen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, at A10.\r\nMiraculously, the victim survived. Ibid.\r\n   Budder’s crime was rare in its brutality. The sentence\r\nthe jury imposed was also rare. According to the study\r\nrelied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such offender\r\nin its prison system before Budder’s offense. P. Annino, D.\r\nRasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for\r\nNon-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14\r\n(Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, there\r\nfore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma’s citizens as\r\nmorally opposed to life-without-parole sentences for juve\r\nniles nonhomicide offenders.\r\n   Yet Oklahoma’s experience proves the inescapable flaw\r\nin that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws\r\nthat allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole\r\nsentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries\r\ninvoke those laws rarely—in the unusual cases that they\r\nfind exceptionally depraved. I cannot agree with the\r\nCourt that Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally\r\ndisabled from using this sentencing practice merely be\r\ncause they have not done so more frequently. If anything,\r\nthe rarity of this penalty’s use underscores just how judi\r\ncious sentencing judges and juries across the country have\r\nbeen in invoking it.\r\n   This fact is entirely consistent with the Court’s intuition\r\nthat juveniles generally are less culpable and more capable\r\nof growth than adults. See infra, at 21–22. Graham’s own\r\n18                       GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase provides another example. Graham was statutorily\r\neligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first\r\ncrime. But the record indicates that the trial court did not\r\ngive such a sentence serious consideration at Graham’s\r\ninitial plea hearing. It was only after Graham subse\r\nquently violated his parole by invading a home at gun\r\npoint that the maximum sentence was imposed.\r\n   In sum, the Court’s calculation that 123 juvenile non\r\nhomicide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed\r\nnationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly\r\namounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice\r\noffends our common sense of decency.11\r\n——————\r\n  11 Because  existing legislation plainly suffices to refute any consensus\r\nagainst this sentencing practice, I assume the accuracy of the Court’s\r\nevidence regarding the frequency with which this sentence has been\r\nimposed. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about\r\nthe Court’s figures. First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those\r\njuveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis\r\nall juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (e.g., 70 or 80\r\nyears’ imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury\r\nimposing such a long sentence—which effectively denies the offender\r\nany material opportunity for parole—would express moral outrage at a\r\nlife-without-parole sentence.\r\n   Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the\r\nCourt’s analysis, the statistical information presently available would\r\nbe woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule\r\nthat can be revoked only by constitutional amendment. The only\r\nevidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sen\r\ntence’s imposition was a single study completed after this Court\r\ngranted certiorari in this case. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, & C.\r\nRice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida\r\nCompared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to\r\nquestion the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the\r\nstudy itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its\r\nkind. See id., at 1. The Court’s questionable decision to “complete” the\r\nstudy on its own does not materially increase its reliability. For one\r\nthing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from\r\never disputing its findings. Complicating matters further, the original\r\nstudy sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the\r\nStates themselves, see ibid.; the study has never been peer reviewed;\r\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    19\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the\r\nCourt finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case\r\nare stronger than those supporting at least one other\r\npenalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court,\r\njoined by the author of today’s opinion, upheld the applica\r\ntion of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the\r\nfact that no such punishment had been carried out on a\r\nperson of that age in this country in nearly 30 years. See\r\nStanford, 492 U. S., at 374. Whatever the statistical\r\nfrequency with which life-without-parole sentences have\r\nbeen imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the\r\nlast 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.\r\n   In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation\r\nand the frequency of a penalty’s use are merely ornaments\r\nin the Court’s analysis, window dressing that accompanies\r\nits judicial fiat.12 By the Court’s own decree, “[c]ommunity\r\n——————\r\nand specific data on all 123 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of\r\nconviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification of the\r\nCourt’s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames Florida\r\nfor all of this. See ante, at 12. But as already noted, it is not Florida’s\r\nburden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this\r\nsentencing practice, but Graham’s “heavy burden” to prove a consensus\r\nagainst it. See supra, at 16.\r\n  12 I confine to a footnote the Court’s discussion of foreign laws and\r\n\r\nsentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such\r\nfactors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court’s\r\ndiscernment of any longstanding tradition in this Nation. See Atkins,\r\n536 U. S., at 324–325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Here, two points\r\nsuffice. First, despite the Court’s attempt to count the actual number of\r\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in\r\nother nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within\r\nour borders), the laws of other countries permit juvenile life-without\r\nparole sentences, see Child Rights Information, Network, C. de la Vega,\r\nM. Montesano, & A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on\r\nJuvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3,\r\n2009) (“Eleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the\r\nsentencing of child offenders to life without the possibility of release,”\r\nonline at http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as\r\nvisited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)).\r\n20                      GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nconsensus . . . is not itself determinative.” Ante, at 16.\r\nOnly the independent moral judgment of this Court is\r\nsufficient to decide the question. See ibid.\r\n                              C\r\n  Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court\r\nshifts to the heart of its argument: its “independent judg\r\nment” that this sentencing practice does not “serv[e] legiti\r\nmate penological goals.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court begins\r\nthat analysis with the obligatory preamble that “ ‘[t]he\r\nEighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one\r\npenological theory,’ ” ante, at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501\r\nU. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), then promptly\r\nmandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems\r\nbest.\r\n  First, the Court acknowledges that, at a minimum, the\r\nimposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders serves two “legitimate” penological\r\ngoals: incapacitation and deterrence. Ante, at 21–23. By\r\ndefinition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation\r\nby ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed\r\nburglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex\r\ncrimes described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, no longer\r\nthreaten their communities. See ante, at 9 (opinion con\r\ncurring in judgment). That should settle the matter, since\r\nthe Court acknowledges that incapacitation is an “impor\r\ntant” penological goal. Ante, at 22. Yet, the Court finds\r\nthis goal “inadequate” to justify the life-without-parole\r\nsentences here. Ante, at 22 (emphasis added). A similar\r\nfate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such\r\nsentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to\r\n——————\r\nSecond, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the\r\nworld remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile\r\noffenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself\r\namong the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making\r\nthat choice.\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsome degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as\r\nillegitimate, but as insufficient. Ante, at 21 (“[A]ny limited\r\ndeterrent effect provided by life without parole is not\r\nenough to justify the sentence.” (emphasis added)).\r\n   The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but\r\nlaments that life-without-parole sentences do little to\r\npromote this goal because they result in the offender’s\r\npermanent incarceration. Ante, at 23. Of course, the\r\nCourt recognizes that rehabilitation’s “utility and proper\r\nimplementation” are subject to debate. Ante, at 23. But\r\nthat does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may\r\nnot “forswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.” Ibid. In other\r\nwords, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate “any one\r\npenological theory,” ante, at 20 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), just one the Court approves.\r\n   Ultimately, however, the Court’s “independent judg\r\nment” and the proportionality rule itself center on retribu\r\ntion—the notion that a criminal sentence should be pro\r\nportioned to “ ‘the personal culpability of the criminal\r\noffender.’ ” Ante, at 16, 20–21 (quoting Tison v. Arizona,\r\n481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987)). The Court finds that retribu\r\ntive purposes are not served here for two reasons.\r\n                             1\r\n  First, quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 569–570, the Court\r\nconcludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults\r\nbecause, as compared to adults, they “have a ‘ “lack of\r\nmaturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” ’ ”\r\nand “their characters are ‘not as well formed.’ ” Ante, at\r\n17. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consis\r\ntent with the evidence recounted above that judges and\r\njuries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently,\r\ndespite legislative authorization to do so in many more\r\ncases. See Part III–B, supra. Our society tends to treat\r\nthe average juvenile as less culpable than the average\r\nadult. But the question here does not involve the average\r\n22                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\njuvenile. The question, instead, is whether the Constitu\r\ntion prohibits judges and juries from ever concluding that\r\nan offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated suffi\r\ncient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his perma\r\nnent incarceration.\r\n   In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the\r\nCourt cites “developments in psychology and brain sci\r\nence” indicating that juvenile minds “continue to mature\r\nthrough late adolescence,” ante, at 17 (citing Brief for\r\nAmerican Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–\r\n24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as\r\nAmici Curiae 22–27 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that\r\njuveniles are “more likely [than adults] to engage in risky\r\nbehaviors,” id., at 7. But even if such generalizations from\r\nsocial science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking,\r\nthe Court misstates the data on which it relies.\r\n   The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial\r\nnumber of youths to engage in “risky” or antisocial behav\r\niors with the propensity of a much smaller group to com\r\nmit violent crimes. Ante, at 25–29. But research relied\r\nupon by the amici cited in the Court’s opinion differenti\r\nates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a\r\nfleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pat\r\ntern. See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-Course-\r\nPersistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxon\r\nomy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA\r\nBrief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who\r\nare “antisocial only during adolescence” and a smaller\r\ngroup who engage in antisocial behavior “at every life\r\nstage” despite “drift[ing] through successive systems\r\naimed at curbing their deviance”). That research further\r\nsuggests that the pattern of behavior in the latter group\r\noften sets in before 18. See Moffitt, supra, at 684 (“The\r\nwell-documented resistance of antisocial personality dis\r\norder to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the\r\nlife-course-persistent style is fixed sometime before age\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n18”). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evi\r\ndence that an adolescent offender’s antisocial behavior is\r\nnot transient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the\r\nTaxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-\r\nLimited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status\r\nof Criminological Theory 277, 292–293 (F. Cullen, J.\r\nWright, & K. Blevins eds. 2006) (observing that “life\r\ncourse persistent” males “tended to specialize in serious\r\noffenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault, robbery,\r\nviolating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited” ones\r\n“specialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5,\r\npublic drunkenness, giving false information on applica\r\ntion forms, pirating computer software, etc.)”).\r\n   In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this psychologi\r\ncal or sociological data is sufficient to support the Court’s\r\n“ ‘moral’ ” conclusion that youth defeats culpability in every\r\ncase. Ante, at 18 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570); see\r\nid., at 618 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case\r\nAgainst Adolescence 171 (2007) (reporting on a study of\r\njuvenile reasoning skills and concluding that “most teens\r\nare capable of conventional, adult-like moral reasoning”).\r\n   The Court responds that a categorical rule is nonethe\r\nless necessary to prevent the “ ‘unacceptable likelihood’ ”\r\nthat a judge or jury, unduly swayed by “ ‘the brutality or\r\ncold-blooded nature’ ” of a juvenile’s nonhomicide crime,\r\nwill sentence him to a life-without-parole sentence for\r\nwhich he possesses “ ‘insufficient culpability,’ ” ante, at 27\r\n(quoting Roper, supra, at 572–573). I find that justifica\r\ntion entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal\r\njustice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand\r\nbetween the defendant and an outraged public and dispas\r\nsionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of\r\npunishment based on the evidence presented. That proc\r\ness necessarily admits of human error. But so does the\r\nprocess of judging in which we engage. As between the\r\ntwo, I find far more “unacceptable” that this Court,\r\n24                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nswayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of\r\nyouth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to\r\ndecide for themselves when the rare case requires differ\r\nent treatment.\r\n                                2\r\n   That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does\r\nnot even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile\r\nmind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today\r\nwould be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and\r\nfederal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for\r\njuveniles who commit homicides. See ante, at 18–19. The\r\nCourt thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in\r\nthe psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from\r\nacquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life\r\nwithout-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects over\r\nwhelming legislative consensus only on the question of\r\nwhich acts are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.\r\n   The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old\r\nwho pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate suffi\r\ncient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry\r\ninto society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8\r\nyear-old and leaves her for dead does not. See ante, at 17–\r\n19; cf. ante, at 9 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)\r\n(describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Mi\r\nlagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court’s conclusion that\r\nlife-without-parole sentences are “grossly disproportion\r\nate” for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very\r\nlittle to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do\r\nwith its perception that “defendants who do not kill, in\r\ntend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categori\r\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish\r\nment than are murderers.” Ante, at 18.\r\n   That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting\r\nconstraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such\r\nan untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nquestion of what acts are “deserving” of what punishments\r\nis bound so tightly with questions of morality and social\r\nconditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question\r\nfor legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previ\r\nously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding\r\ncertain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capi\r\ntal punishment. See supra, at 4. But never before today\r\nhas the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to\r\nimpose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser\r\npunishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established\r\nboundary raises the question whether any democratic\r\nchoice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the\r\nCourt’s ever-expanding constitutional veto.\r\n                            IV\r\n   Although the concurrence avoids the problems associ\r\nated with expanding categorical proportionality review to\r\nnoncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality\r\nanalysis in a way that raises the same fundamental\r\nconcern. Although I do not believe Solem merits stare\r\ndecisis treatment, Graham’s claim cannot prevail even\r\nunder that test (as it has been limited by the Court’s\r\nsubsequent precedents). Solem instructs a court first to\r\ncompare the “gravity” of an offender’s conduct to the\r\n“harshness of the penalty” to determine whether an\r\n“inference” of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S.,\r\nat 290–291. Only in “the rare case” in which such an\r\ninference is present should the court proceed to the “ob\r\njective” part of the inquiry—an intra- and interjurisdic\r\ntional comparison of the defendant’s sentence with others\r\nsimilarly situated. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\r\n   Under the Court’s precedents, I fail to see how an “in\r\nference” of gross disproportionality arises here. The con\r\ncurrence notes several arguably mitigating facts—\r\nGraham’s “lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and\r\n26                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nimmaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbring\r\ning.” Ante, at 7 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment).\r\nBut the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole\r\nsentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a\r\nnonviolent drug crime. See Harmelin, supra, at 1002–\r\n1004. Graham’s conviction for an actual violent felony is\r\nsurely more severe than that offense. As for Graham’s\r\nage, it is true that Roper held juveniles categorically ineli\r\ngible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence ex\r\nplains, Roper was based on the “explicit conclusion that\r\n[juveniles] ‘cannot with reliability be classified among the\r\nworst offenders’ ”; it did “not establish that juveniles can\r\nnever be eligible for life without parole.” Ante, at 5\r\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Roper,\r\n543 U. S., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of ROBERTS,\r\nC. J.)). In my view, Roper’s principles are thus not gener\r\nally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.\r\n   By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the\r\nsame type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it\r\nrestrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical\r\nruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham\r\n“the general presumption of diminished culpability” for\r\njuveniles, ante, at 7, apparently because it believes that\r\nGraham’s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were\r\n“certainly less serious” than murder or rape, ibid. It\r\nrecoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend\r\nthe same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex\r\ncrime. See ante, at 10. I simply cannot accept that these\r\nsubjective judgments of proportionality are ones the\r\nEighth Amendment authorizes us to make.\r\n   The “objective” elements of the Solem test provide no\r\nadditional support for the concurrence’s conclusion. The\r\nconcurrence compares Graham’s sentence to “similar”\r\nsentences in Florida and concludes that Graham’s sen\r\ntence was “far more severe.” Ante, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J,\r\nconcurring in judgment). But strangely, the concurrence\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nuses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as\r\nexamples of “similar” offenses, even though it seems that a\r\nrun-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to\r\nGraham’s criminal history, which includes a charge for\r\narmed burglary with assault, and a probation violation for\r\ninvading a home at gunpoint.\r\n   And even if Graham’s sentence is higher than ones he\r\nmight have received for an armed burglary with assault in\r\nother jurisdictions, see ante, at 8–9, this hardly seems\r\nrelevant if one takes seriously the principle that “ ‘[a]bsent\r\na constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to tradi\r\ntional notions of federalism, some State will always bear\r\nthe distinction of treating particular offenders more se\r\nverely than any other State.’ ” Harmelin, supra, at 1000\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Rummel, 445 U. S., at\r\n282; emphasis added). Applying Solem, the Court has\r\nupheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under Califor\r\nnia’s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and\r\nits amici could cite only “a single instance of a similar\r\nsentence imposed outside the context of California’s three\r\nstrikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching\r\ntwo million individuals.” Ewing, 538 U. S., at 47 (BREYER,\r\nJ., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole\r\nsentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan\r\ncharged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the\r\nfact that only one other State would have authorized such\r\na stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that\r\nState required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilo\r\ngrams) to trigger the penalty. See Harmelin, supra, at\r\n1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham’s sentence is cer\r\ntainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases,\r\nso his claim fails even under Solem\r\n                     *     *    *\r\n  Both the Court and the concurrence claim their deci\r\nsions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line\r\n28                      GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndrawing problems to which courts must seek answers\r\nbeyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds\r\nthat “[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual free\r\ndom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide\r\ncrime,” but must provide the offender with “some mean\r\ningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon\r\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Ante, at 24. But\r\nwhat, exactly, does such a “meaningful” opportunity en\r\ntail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment\r\nprinciples will govern review by the parole boards the\r\nCourt now demands that States empanel? The Court\r\nprovides no answers to these questions, which will no\r\ndoubt embroil the courts for years.13\r\n                              V\r\n  The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life\r\nwithout-parole sentence ‘fits’ the crime at issue here or the\r\ncrimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more generally,\r\nbut to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The\r\nFlorida Legislature has concluded that such sentences\r\nshould be available for persons under 18 who commit\r\ncertain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to\r\nimpose that legislatively authorized sentence here. Be\r\ncause a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a “cruel\r\nand unusual” method of punishment under any standard,\r\n——————\r\n   13 It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit\r\n\r\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\r\npermits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of impris\r\nonment for up to 40 years. Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–1.3–401(4)(b) (2009).\r\nIn light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently\r\npermits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offend\r\ners, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence\r\nof agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole\r\nhearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\r\n6–7 (counsel for Graham, stating that, “[o]ur position is that it should\r\nbe left up to the States to decide. We think that the . . . Colorado\r\nprovision would probably be constitutional”).\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The fact that the\r\nCourt categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an over\r\nwhelming legislative majority in favor of leaving that sen\r\ntencing option available under certain cases simply illus\r\ntrates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional\r\nprinciple the Court has reached to ensure that its own\r\nsense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of\r\nthe people and their representatives.\r\n  I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that “[w]e learn, some\r\ntimes, from our mistakes.” Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).\r\nPerhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.\r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

I write separately to make two points.\r\n   First, the Court holds only that “for a juvenile offender\r\nwho did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment\r\nforbids the sentence of life without parole.” Ante, at 24\r\n(emphasis added). Nothing in the Court’s opinion affects\r\nthe imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the\r\npossibility of parole. Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral\r\nargument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without\r\nthe possibility of parole “probably” would be constitu\r\ntional. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7; see also ante, at 28, n. 12\r\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\r\n   Second, the question whether petitioner’s sentence\r\nviolates the narrow, as-applied proportionality principle\r\nthat applies to noncapital sentences is not properly before\r\nus in this case. Although petitioner asserted an as-applied\r\nproportionality challenge to his sentence before the Flor\r\nida courts, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1636586\"><a href=\"/opinion/1636586/graham-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51–53 (Fla.

In\r\nstead, petitioner argued for only a categorical rule banning\r\nthe imposition of life without parole on any juvenile con\r\nvicted of a nonhomicide offense. Because petitioner aban\r\ndoned his as-applied claim, I would not reach that issue.\r\n2                  GRAHAM v.

Argued November 9, 2009—Decided May 17, 2010; \r\n\r\n                      modified July 6, 2010 \r\n\r\nPetitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and\r\n  another crime. Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sen\r\n  tenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt. Sub\r\n  sequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms\r\n  of his probation by committing additional crimes. The trial court ad\r\n  judicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his proba\r\n  tion, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary. Because\r\n  Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham\r\n  no possibility of release except executive clemency. He challenged his\r\n  sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Pun\r\n  ishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal af\r\n  firmed.\r\nHeld: The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to\r\n life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime. Pp. 7–31.\r\n    (a) Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the\r\n “precept . . . that punishment for crime should be graduated and pro\r\n portioned to [the] offense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349,\r\n 367. The Court’s cases implementing the proportionality standard\r\n fall within two general classifications. In cases of the first type, the\r\n Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the\r\n length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for\r\n a particular defendant’s crime. The second classification comprises\r\n cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against\r\n the death penalty. In a subset of such cases considering the nature of\r\n the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is im\r\n permissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals. E.g., Ken\r\n nedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___. In a second subset, cases turn\r\n ing on the offender’s characteristics, the Court has prohibited death\r\n2                          GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v.\r\n    Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low\r\n    range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304. In cases involving categori\r\n    cal rules, the Court first considers “objective indicia of society’s stan\r\n    dards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice” to\r\n    determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc\r\n    ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, looking to “the\r\n    standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court’s\r\n    own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment’s\r\n    text, history, meaning, and purpose,” Kennedy, supra, at ___, the\r\n    Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment\r\n    whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper,\r\n    supra, at 564. Because this case implicates a particular type of sen\r\n    tence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed\r\n    a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical ap\r\n    proach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy. Pp. 7–10.\r\n       (b) Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that\r\n    the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional. Pp. 10–31.\r\n         (1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for\r\n    any juvenile offenders. Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole\r\n    for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Thirty-seven\r\n    States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit\r\n    sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in\r\n    some circumstances. The State relies on these data to argue that no\r\n    national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.\r\n    An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions\r\n    that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\r\n    however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide,\r\n    there are only 123 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sen\r\n    tences for nonhomicide crimes. Because 77 of those offenders are\r\n    serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 46 are imprisoned\r\n    in just 10 States, it appears that only 11 jurisdictions nationwide in\r\n    fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide of\r\n    fenders, while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal\r\n    Government do not impose them despite apparent statutory authori\r\n    zation. Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomi\r\n    cide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence\r\n    stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sen\r\n    tences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.\r\n    While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentenc\r\n    ing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the\r\n    type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing\r\n    practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposi\r\n    tion. The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the\r\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nsentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not nec\r\nessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have delib\r\nerately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate. See\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850. Pp. 10–16.\r\n     (2) The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without\r\nparole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited cul\r\npability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead\r\nthe Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel\r\nand unusual. No recent data provide reason to reconsider Roper’s\r\nholding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less\r\ndeserving of the most serious forms of punishment. 543 U. S., at 551.\r\nMoreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that\r\nlife will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments\r\nthan are murderers. E.g., Kennedy, supra. Serious nonhomicide\r\ncrimes “may be devastating in their harm . . . but ‘in terms of moral\r\ndepravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,’ . . . they\r\ncannot be compared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ”\r\nId., at ___. Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile of\r\nfender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral\r\nculpability. Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analy\r\nsis. As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second most\r\nsevere penalty permitted by law,” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.\r\n957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on\r\naverage serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in\r\nprison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572. And\r\nnone of the legitimate goals of penal sanctions—retribution, deter\r\nrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538\r\nU. S. 11, 25—is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573. Be\r\ncause age “18 is the point where society draws the line for many pur\r\nposes between childhood and adulthood,” it is the age below which a\r\ndefendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomi\r\ncide crime. Id., at 574. A State is not required to guarantee eventual\r\nfreedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that pro\r\nvides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demon\r\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first\r\ninstance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.\r\nPp. 16–24.\r\n     (3) A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two\r\nalternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional con\r\ncerns. First, although Florida and other States have made substan\r\ntial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of\r\nyouthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sen\r\ntence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a\r\n4                         GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and\r\n    are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender\r\n    will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability. Sec\r\n    ond, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offender’s\r\n    age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross\r\n    disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with\r\n    sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psy\r\n    chological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sen\r\n    tence from the many that have the capacity for change. Cf. Roper,\r\n    supra, at 572–573. Nor does such an approach take account of spe\r\n    cial difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation,\r\n    given juveniles’ impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long\r\n    term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults. A categorical rule\r\n    avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury\r\n    will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently\r\n    culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide. It also\r\n    gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and re\r\n    form. Pp. 24–29.\r\n          (4) Additional support for the Court’s conclusion lies in the fact\r\n    that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over:\r\n    The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sen\r\n    tence. While the judgments of other nations and the international\r\n    community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth\r\n    Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent\r\n    conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual. See,\r\n    e.g., Roper, supra, at 575–578.

The sentence was\r\nimposed by the State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the\r\nsentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Un\r\nusual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States\r\nby the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nRobinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).\r\n                            I\r\n  Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on\r\nJanuary 6, 1987. Graham’s parents were addicted to\r\ncrack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early\r\nyears. Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hy\r\nperactivity disorder in elementary school. He began\r\ndrinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked\r\nmarijuana at age 13.\r\n  In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three\r\nother school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque\r\nrestaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. One youth, who\r\nworked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just\r\n2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbefore closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing\r\nmasks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham’s\r\nmasked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager\r\nin the back of the head with a metal bar. When the man\r\nager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two\r\nyouths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third\r\naccomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for\r\nhis head injury. No money was taken.\r\n   Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under\r\nFlorida law, it is within a prosecutor’s discretion whether\r\nto charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for\r\nmost felony crimes. Fla. Stat. §985.227(1)(b) (2003) (sub\r\nsequently renumbered at §985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Gra\r\nham’s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.\r\nThe charges against Graham were armed burglary with\r\nassault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maxi\r\nmum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility\r\nof parole, §§810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted\r\narmed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maxi\r\nmum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, §§812.13(2)(b),\r\n777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).\r\n   On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both\r\ncharges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to\r\nthe trial court. After reciting “this is my first and last\r\ntime getting in trouble,” he continued “I’ve decided to turn\r\nmy life around.” App. 379–380. Graham said “I made a\r\npromise to God and myself that if I get a second chance,\r\nI’m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National\r\nFootball League].” Id., at 380.\r\n   The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court\r\nwithheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and\r\nsentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of proba\r\ntion. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of\r\nhis probation in the county jail, but he received credit for\r\nthe time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on\r\nJune 25, 2004.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          3\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2,\r\n2004, Graham again was arrested. The State’s case was\r\nas follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a\r\nhome invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo\r\nBailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.\r\nAccording to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham,\r\nBailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home\r\nwhere Carlos Rodriguez lived. Graham, followed by Bailey\r\nand Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol\r\nto Rodriguez’s chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three\r\nheld Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at\r\ngunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for\r\nmoney. Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices\r\nbarricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.\r\n   The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and\r\nLawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second\r\nrobbery, during which Bailey was shot. Graham, who had\r\nborrowed his father’s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to\r\nthe hospital and left them there. As Graham drove away,\r\na police sergeant signaled him to stop. Graham continued\r\nat a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole. He\r\ntried to flee on foot but was apprehended. Three hand\r\nguns were found in his car.\r\n   When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied in\r\nvolvement in the crimes. He said he encountered Bailey\r\nand Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot. One of the\r\ndetectives told Graham that the victims of the home inva\r\nsion had identified him. He asked Graham, “Aside from\r\nthe two robberies tonight how many more were you in\r\nvolved in?” Graham responded, “Two to three before\r\ntonight.” Id., at 160. The night that Graham allegedly\r\ncommitted the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th\r\nbirthday.\r\n   On December 13, 2004, Graham’s probation officer filed\r\nwith the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham\r\nhad violated the conditions of his probation by possessing\r\n4                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\na firearm, committing crimes, and associating with per\r\nsons engaged in criminal activity. The trial court held\r\nhearings on Graham’s violations about a year later, in\r\nDecember 2005 and January 2006. The judge who pre\r\nsided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham’s\r\nguilty plea to the earlier offenses.\r\n   Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the\r\nhome invasion robbery; but, even after the court under\r\nscored that the admission could expose him to a life sen\r\ntence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating proba\r\ntion conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence\r\nrelated to the home invasion, including testimony from the\r\nvictims. The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting\r\nhis attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating\r\nhis probation. The court further found that Graham had\r\nviolated his probation by committing a home invasion\r\nrobbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with\r\npersons engaged in criminal activity.\r\n   The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Flor\r\nida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive\r\nabsent a downward departure by the judge was 5 years’\r\nimprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment.\r\nGraham’s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture\r\nsentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the\r\nFlorida Department of Corrections recommended that\r\nGraham receive an even lower sentence—at most 4 years’\r\nimprisonment. The State recommended that Graham\r\nreceive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years\r\non the attempted armed robbery count.\r\n   After hearing Graham’s testimony, the trial court ex\r\nplained the sentence it was about to pronounce:\r\n      “Mr. Graham, as I look back on your case, yours is\r\n    really candidly a sad situation. You had, as far as I\r\n    can tell, you have quite a family structure. You had a\r\n    lot of people who wanted to try and help you get your\r\n             Cite as: 560 U.

And at the time you\r\nseemed through your letters that that is exactly what\r\nyou wanted to do. And I don’t know why it is that you\r\nthrew your life away. I don’t know why.\r\n   “But you did, and that is what is so sad about this\r\ntoday is that you have actually been given a chance to\r\nget through this, the original charge, which were very\r\nserious charges to begin with. . . . The attempted rob\r\nbery with a weapon was a very serious charge.\r\n  .            .              .                .      .\r\n   “[I]n a very short period of time you were back be\r\nfore the Court on a violation of this probation, and\r\nthen here you are two years later standing before me,\r\nliterally the—facing a life sentence as to—up to life as\r\nto count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.\r\n   “And I don’t understand why you would be given\r\nsuch a great opportunity to do something with your\r\nlife and why you would throw it away. The only thing\r\nthat I can rationalize is that you decided that this is\r\nhow you were going to lead your life and that there is\r\nnothing that we can do for you. And as the state\r\npointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of\r\ncriminal conduct on your part and that we can’t help\r\nyou any further. We can’t do anything to deter you.\r\nThis is the way you are going to lead your life, and I\r\ndon’t know why you are going to. You’ve made that\r\ndecision. I have no idea. But, evidently, that is what\r\nyou decided to do.\r\n   “So then it becomes a focus, if I can’t do anything to\r\nhelp you, if I can’t do anything to get you back on the\r\nright path, then I have to start focusing on the com\r\nmunity and trying to protect the community from your\r\n6                   GRAHAM v.

And, unfortunately, that is where we are to\r\n    day is I don’t see where I can do anything to help you\r\n    any further. You’ve evidently decided this is the di\r\n    rection you’re going to take in life, and it’s unfortu\r\n    nate that you made that choice.\r\n      “I have reviewed the statute. I don’t see where any\r\n    further juvenile sanctions would be appropriate. I\r\n    don’t see where any youthful offender sanctions would\r\n    be appropriate. Given your escalating pattern of\r\n    criminal conduct, it is apparent to the Court that you\r\n    have decided that this is the way you are going to live\r\n    your life and that the only thing I can do now is to try\r\n    and protect the community from your actions.” Id., at\r\n    392–394.\r\n  The trial court found Graham guilty of the earlier armed\r\nburglary and attempted armed robbery charges. It sen\r\ntenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law\r\non each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary\r\nand 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because\r\nFlorida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat.\r\n§921.002(1)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant\r\nno possibility of release unless he is granted executive\r\nclemency.\r\n  Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his\r\nsentence under the Eighth Amendment. The motion was\r\ndeemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it\r\nwithin 60 days. The First District Court of Appeal of\r\nFlorida affirmed, concluding that Graham’s sentence was\r\nnot grossly disproportionate to his crimes. 982 So. 2d 43\r\n(2008). The court took note of the seriousness of Graham’s\r\noffenses and their violent nature, as well as the fact that\r\nthey “were not committed by a pre-teen, but a seventeen\r\nyear-old who was ultimately sentenced at the age of nine\r\nteen.” Id., at 52. The court concluded further that Gra\r\nham was incapable of rehabilitation. Although Graham\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. ___ (2009).\r\n                              II\r\n   The Eighth Amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not\r\nbe required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and\r\nunusual punishments inflicted.” To determine whether a\r\npunishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look beyond\r\nhistorical conceptions to “ ‘the evolving standards of de\r\ncency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ”\r\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop\r\nv. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\r\n“This is because ‘[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not\r\nmerely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral\r\njudgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its\r\napplicability must change as the basic mores of society\r\nchange.’ ” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\r\n(slip op., at 8) (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,\r\n382 (1972) (Burger, C. J., dissenting)).\r\n   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits\r\nthe imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under\r\nall circumstances. See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730\r\n(2002). “[P]unishments of torture,” for example, “are\r\nforbidden.” Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879).\r\nThese cases underscore the essential principle that, under\r\nthe Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the hu\r\nman attributes even of those who have committed serious\r\ncrimes.\r\n   For the most part, however, the Court’s precedents\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nconsider punishments challenged not as inherently bar\r\nbaric but as disproportionate to the crime. The concept of\r\nproportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.\r\nEmbodied in the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual\r\npunishments is the “precept of justice that punishment for\r\ncrime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] of\r\nfense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910).\r\n   The Court’s cases addressing the proportionality of\r\nsentences fall within two general classifications. The first\r\ninvolves challenges to the length of term-of-years sen\r\ntences given all the circumstances in a particular case.\r\nThe second comprises cases in which the Court imple\r\nments the proportionality standard by certain categorical\r\nrestrictions on the death penalty.\r\n   In the first classification the Court considers all of the\r\ncircumstances of the case to determine whether the sen\r\ntence is unconstitutionally excessive. Under this ap\r\nproach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without\r\nparole sentence for the defendant’s seventh nonviolent\r\nfelony, the crime of passing a worthless check. Solem v.\r\nHelm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). In other cases, however, it\r\nhas been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of\r\nproportionality. A leading case is Harmelin v. Michigan,\r\n501 U. S. 957 (1991), in which the offender was sentenced\r\nunder state law to life without parole for possessing a\r\nlarge quantity of cocaine. A closely divided Court upheld\r\nthe sentence. The controlling opinion concluded that the\r\nEighth Amendment contains a “narrow proportionality\r\nprinciple,” that “does not require strict proportionality\r\nbetween crime and sentence” but rather “forbids only\r\nextreme sentences that are ‘grossly disproportionate’ to\r\nthe crime.” Id., at 997, 1000–1001 (KENNEDY, J., concur\r\nring in part and concurring in judgment). Again closely\r\ndivided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25\r\nyears to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under Califor\r\nnia’s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nEwing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also Lockyer\r\nv. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also up\r\nheld a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a\r\ndefendant’s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining\r\nmoney by false pretenses, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263\r\n(1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of mari\r\njuana with intent to distribute and distribution of mari\r\njuana, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam).\r\n  The controlling opinion in Harmelin explained its ap\r\nproach for determining whether a sentence for a term of\r\nyears is grossly disproportionate for a particular defen\r\ndant’s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity\r\nof the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S.,\r\nat 1005 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). “[I]n the rare case in\r\nwhich [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an infer\r\nence of gross disproportionality” the court should then\r\ncompare the defendant’s sentence with the sentences\r\nreceived by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and\r\nwith the sentences imposed for the same crime in other\r\njurisdictions. Ibid. If this comparative analysis “vali\r\ndate[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly\r\ndisproportionate,” the sentence is cruel and unusual. Ibid.\r\n   The second classification of cases has used categorical\r\nrules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previ\r\nous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.\r\nThe classification in turn consists of two subsets, one\r\nconsidering the nature of the offense, the other consider\r\ning the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the\r\nnature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital\r\npunishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes\r\nagainst individuals. Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at 28);\r\nsee also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Coker v.\r\nGeorgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the\r\ncharacteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted\r\ncategorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defen\r\ndants who committed their crimes before the age of 18,\r\n10                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), or whose intellec\r\ntual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536\r\nU. S. 304 (2002). See also Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487\r\nU. S. 815 (1988).\r\n   In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has\r\ntaken the following approach. The Court first considers\r\n“objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in\r\nlegislative enactments and state practice” to determine\r\nwhether there is a national consensus against the sentenc\r\ning practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, guided\r\nby “the standards elaborated by controlling precedents\r\nand by the Court’s own understanding and interpretation\r\nof the Eighth Amendment’s text, history, meaning, and\r\npurpose,” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the\r\nCourt must determine in the exercise of its own inde\r\npendent judgment whether the punishment in question\r\nviolates the Constitution. Roper, supra, at 564.\r\n   The present case involves an issue the Court has not\r\nconsidered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of\r\nyears sentence. The approach in cases such as Harmelin\r\nand Ewing is suited for considering a gross proportionality\r\nchallenge to a particular defendant’s sentence, but here a\r\nsentencing practice itself is in question. This case impli\r\ncates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an\r\nentire class of offenders who have committed a range of\r\ncrimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the\r\nseverity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does\r\nnot advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the ques\r\ntion presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in\r\ncases that involved the categorical approach, specifically\r\nAtkins, Roper, and Kennedy.\r\n                          III\r\n                           A\r\n  The analysis begins with objective indicia of national\r\nconsensus. “[T]he ‘clearest and most reliable objective\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six\r\njurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for\r\nany juvenile offenders. See Appendix, infra, Part III.\r\nSeven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile\r\noffenders, but only for homicide crimes. Id., Part II.\r\nThirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia\r\npermit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile non\r\nhomicide offender in some circumstances. Id., Part I.\r\nFederal law also allows for the possibility of life without\r\nparole for offenders as young as 13. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\r\n§§2241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying\r\non this metric, the State and its amici argue that there is\r\nno national consensus against the sentencing practice at\r\nissue.\r\n  This argument is incomplete and unavailing. “There are\r\nmeasures of consensus other than legislation.” Kennedy,\r\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). Actual sentencing practices\r\nare an important part of the Court’s inquiry into consen\r\nsus. See Enmund, supra, at 794–796; Thompson, supra,\r\nat 831–832 (plurality opinion); Atkins, supra, at 316;\r\nRoper, supra, at 564–565; Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\r\nat 22–23). Here, an examination of actual sentencing\r\npractices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is\r\npermitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.\r\nAlthough these statutory schemes contain no explicit\r\nprohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infre\r\nquent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are\r\nonly 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life with\r\nout parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D.\r\nRasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for\r\nNon-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2\r\n(Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).\r\n  The State contends that this study’s tally is inaccurate\r\n12                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbecause it does not count juvenile offenders who were\r\nconvicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense,\r\neven when the offender received a life without parole\r\nsentence for the nonhomicide. See Brief for Respondent\r\n34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009,\r\nNo. 08–7621, pp. 28–31. This distinction is unpersuasive.\r\nJuvenile offenders who committed both homicide and\r\nnonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a\r\nsentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed\r\nno homicide. It is difficult to say that a defendant who\r\nreceives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who\r\nwas at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some\r\nsense being punished in part for the homicide when the\r\njudge makes the sentencing determination. The instant\r\ncase concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced\r\nto life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.\r\n   Florida further criticizes this study because the authors\r\nwere unable to obtain complete information on some\r\nStates and because the study was not peer reviewed. See\r\nBrief for Respondent 40. The State does not, however,\r\nprovide any data of its own. Although in the first instance\r\nit is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we\r\nhave been able to supplement the study’s findings. The\r\nstudy’s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally\r\nfor Nevada, Utah, or Virginia. See Annino 11–13. Our\r\nresearch shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has\r\nnone, and Virginia has eight. See Letter from Alejandra\r\nLivingston, Offender Management Division, Nevada Dept.\r\nof Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 26, 2010)\r\n(available in Clerk of Court’s case file); Letter from Steve\r\nGehrke, Utah Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court\r\nLibrary (Mar. 29, 2010) (same); Letter from Dr. Tama S.\r\nCeli, Virginia Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court\r\nLibrary (Mar. 30, 2010) (same). Finally, since the study\r\nwas completed, a defendant in Oklahoma has apparently\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

See Stogsdill, Dela-\r\nware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa\r\nWorld, May 4, 2010, p. A12.\r\n  Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to\r\nthose we have been able to locate independently, there are\r\n123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without\r\nparole sentences. A significant majority of those, 77 in\r\ntotal, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. Annino 2.\r\nThe other 46 are imprisoned in just 10 States—California,\r\nDelaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ne-\r\nvada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia. Id., at 14;\r\nsupra, at 12–13; Letter from Thomas P. Hoey, Dept. of\r\nCorrections, Government of the District of Columbia, to\r\nSupreme Court Library (Mar. 31, 2010) (available in Clerk\r\nof Court’s case file); Letter from Judith Simon Garrett,\r\nU. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), to\r\nSupreme Court Library (Apr. 9, 2010) (available in Clerk\r\nof Court’s case file). Thus, only 11 jurisdictions nation-\r\nwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juve-\r\nnile nonhomicide offenders—and most of those do so quite\r\nrarely—while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the\r\nFederal Government do not impose them despite statutory\r\nauthorization.*\r\n  The numbers cited above reflect all current convicts in a\r\n——————\r\n   * When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a report from the BOP\r\nstating that there are six juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life\r\nwithout parole in the federal system. The Acting Solicitor General\r\nsubsequently informed the Court that further review revealed that\r\nnone of the six prisoners referred to in the earlier BOP report is serving\r\na life without parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime\r\ncompleted before the age of 18. Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting\r\nSolicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (May 24, 2010)\r\n(available in Clerk of Court’s case file). The letter further stated that\r\nthe Government was not aware of any other federal prisoners serving\r\nlife without parole sentences solely for juvenile nonhomicide crimes.\r\nIbid. The opinion was amended in light of this new information.\r\n14                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\njurisdiction’s penal system, regardless of when they were\r\nconvicted. It becomes all the more clear how rare these\r\nsentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do some\r\ntimes impose them, when one considers that a juvenile\r\nsentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison\r\nfor decades. Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all\r\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life\r\nwithout parole sentence stretching back many years. It is\r\nnot certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender nationwide serving a life without\r\nparole sentence, for the statistics are not precise. The\r\navailable data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate\r\nhow rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are\r\nisolated cases that have not been included in the presenta\r\ntions of the parties or the analysis of the Court.\r\n   It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute num\r\nbers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomi\r\ncides are more common than the sentencing practices at\r\nissue in some of this Court’s other Eighth Amendment\r\ncases. See, e.g., Enmund, 458 U. S., at 794 (only six exe\r\ncutions of nontriggerman felony murderers between 1954\r\nand 1982) Atkins, 536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of\r\nmentally retarded defendants in 13-year period). This\r\ncontrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first\r\ngiven to the base number of certain types of offenses. For\r\nexample, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which\r\nstatistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult\r\nand juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes. That\r\nsame year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated\r\nassault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900\r\nfor burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for\r\narson. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and\r\nDelinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online\r\nat http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010,\r\nand available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Although it is\r\nnot certain how many of these numerous juvenile offend\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ners were eligible for life without parole sentences, the\r\ncomparison suggests that in proportion to the opportuni\r\nties for its imposition, life without parole sentences for\r\njuveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as\r\nother sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.\r\n   The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact\r\nthat many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders. The Court confronted\r\na similar situation in Thompson, where a plurality con\r\ncluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than\r\n16 was unconstitutional. A number of States then allowed\r\nthe juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory\r\nscheme. As is the case here, those States authorized the\r\ntransfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at\r\nthat point there was no statutory differentiation between\r\nadults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties.\r\nThe plurality concluded that the transfer laws show “that\r\nthe States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be\r\ntried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be\r\ndealt with effectively in juvenile court), but tells us noth\r\ning about the judgment these States have made regarding\r\nthe appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.”\r\n487 U. S., at 826, n. 24. Justice O’Connor, concurring in\r\nthe judgment, took a similar view. Id., at 850 (“When a\r\nlegislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed\r\nthrough the adult criminal justice system, and capital\r\npunishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the\r\ndeath penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to\r\nsuch defendants. . . . [H]owever, it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have\r\ndeliberately concluded that it would be appropriate”).\r\n   The same reasoning obtains here. Many States have\r\nchosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to\r\nallow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in,\r\nadult court under certain circumstances. Once in adult\r\ncourt, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence\r\n16                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                 Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nas would be given to an adult offender, including a life\r\nwithout parole sentence. But the fact that transfer and\r\ndirect charging laws make life without parole possible for\r\nsome juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not justify a\r\njudgment that many States intended to subject such of\r\nfenders to life without parole sentences.\r\n   For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be\r\nprosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sen\r\ntenced to life without parole. The State acknowledged at\r\noral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could\r\nreceive such a sentence under the letter of the law. See\r\nTr. of Oral Arg. 36–37. All would concede this to be unre\r\nalistic, but the example underscores that the statutory\r\neligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does\r\nnot indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through\r\ndeliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.\r\nSimilarly, the many States that allow life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the\r\npunishment should not be treated as if they have ex\r\npressed the view that the sentence is appropriate. The\r\nsentencing practice now under consideration is exceed\r\ningly rare. And “it is fair to say that a national consensus\r\nhas developed against it.” Atkins, supra, at 316.\r\n                                B\r\n  Community consensus, while “entitled to great weight,”\r\nis not itself determinative of whether a punishment is\r\ncruel and unusual. Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\r\n24). In accordance with the constitutional design, “the\r\ntask of interpreting the Eighth Amendment remains our\r\nresponsibility.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 575. The judicial\r\nexercise of independent judgment requires consideration\r\nof the culpability of the offenders at issue in light of their\r\ncrimes and characteristics, along with the severity of the\r\npunishment in question. Id., at 568; Kennedy, supra, at\r\n___ (slip op., at 27–28); cf. Solem, 463 U. S., at 292. In this\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 569. As compared to adults,\r\njuveniles have a “ ‘lack of maturity and an underdeveloped\r\nsense of responsibility’ ”; they “are more vulnerable or\r\nsusceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\r\nincluding peer pressure”; and their characters are “not as\r\nwell formed.” Id., at 569–570. These salient characteris\r\ntics mean that “[i]t is difficult even for expert psycholo\r\ngists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose\r\ncrime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and\r\nthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\r\ncorruption.” Id., at 573. Accordingly, “juvenile offenders\r\ncannot with reliability be classified among the worst of\r\nfenders.” Id., at 569. A juvenile is not absolved of respon\r\nsibility for his actions, but his transgression “is not as\r\nmorally reprehensible as that of an adult.” Thompson,\r\nsupra, at 835 (plurality opinion).\r\n   No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court’s\r\nobservations in Roper about the nature of juveniles. As\r\npetitioner’s amici point out, developments in psychology\r\nand brain science continue to show fundamental differ\r\nences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,\r\nparts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to\r\nmature through late adolescence.

Juveniles are more capable of change than are\r\nadults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of\r\n“irretrievably depraved character” than are the actions of\r\nadults. Roper, 543 U. S., at 570. It remains true that\r\n“[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to\r\n18                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nequate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a\r\ngreater possibility exists that a minor’s character deficien\r\ncies will be reformed.” Ibid. These matters relate to the\r\nstatus of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to\r\nconsider next the nature of the offenses to which this\r\nharsh penalty might apply.\r\n  The Court has recognized that defendants who do not\r\nkill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are\r\ncategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of\r\npunishment than are murderers. Kennedy, supra; En\r\nmund, 458 U. S. 782; Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137\r\n(1987); Coker, 433 U. S. 584. There is a line “between\r\nhomicide and other serious violent offenses against the\r\nindividual.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).\r\nSerious nonhomicide crimes “may be devastating in their\r\nharm . . . but ‘in terms of moral depravity and of the injury\r\nto the person and to the public,’ . . . they cannot be com\r\npared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ” Id.,\r\nat ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Coker, 433 U. S., at 598\r\n(plurality opinion)). This is because “[l]ife is over for the\r\nvictim of the murderer,” but for the victim of even a very\r\nserious nonhomicide crime, “life . . . is not over and nor\r\nmally is not beyond repair.” Ibid. (plurality opinion).\r\nAlthough an offense like robbery or rape is “a serious\r\ncrime deserving serious punishment,” Enmund, supra, at\r\n797, those crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral\r\nsense.\r\n  It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a\r\njuvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a\r\ntwice diminished moral culpability.        The age of the\r\noffender and the nature of the crime each bear on the\r\nanalysis.\r\n  As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second\r\nmost severe penalty permitted by law.” Harmelin, 501\r\nU. S., at 1001 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). It is true that a\r\ndeath sentence is “unique in its severity and irrevocabil\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nity,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 187 (1976) (joint\r\nopinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); yet life\r\nwithout parole sentences share some characteristics with\r\ndeath sentences that are shared by no other sentences.\r\nThe State does not execute the offender sentenced to life\r\nwithout parole, but the sentence alters the offender’s life\r\nby a forfeiture that is irrevocable. It deprives the convict\r\nof the most basic liberties without giving hope of restora\r\ntion, except perhaps by executive clemency—the remote\r\npossibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the\r\nsentence. Solem, 463 U. S., at 300–301. As one court\r\nobserved in overturning a life without parole sentence for\r\na juvenile defendant, this sentence “means denial of hope;\r\nit means that good behavior and character improvement\r\nare immaterial; it means that whatever the future might\r\nhold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he\r\nwill remain in prison for the rest of his days.” Naovarath\r\nv. State, 105 Nev. 525, 526, 779 P. 2d 944 (1989).\r\n   The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that\r\ndeny convicts the possibility of parole. In Rummel, 445\r\nU. S. 263, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment chal\r\nlenge to a life sentence for a defendant’s third nonviolent\r\nfelony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant\r\nthe possibility of parole. Noting that “parole is an estab\r\nlished variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,”\r\nit was evident that an analysis of the petitioner’s sentence\r\n“could hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actu\r\nally be imprisoned for the rest of his life.” Id., at 280–281\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And in Solem, the\r\nonly previous case striking down a sentence for a term of\r\nyears as grossly disproportionate, the defendant’s sentence\r\nwas deemed “far more severe than the life sentence we\r\nconsidered in Rummel,” because it did not give the defen\r\ndant the possibility of parole. 463 U. S., at 297.\r\n   Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment\r\nfor a juvenile. Under this sentence a juvenile offender will\r\n20                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\non average serve more years and a greater percentage of\r\nhis life in prison than an adult offender. A 16-year-old\r\nand a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole\r\nreceive the same punishment in name only. See Roper,\r\nsupra, at 572; cf. Harmelin, supra, at 996 (“In some cases\r\n. . . there will be negligible difference between life without\r\nparole and other sentences of imprisonment—for example,\r\n. . . a lengthy term sentence without eligibility for parole,\r\ngiven to a 65-year-old man”). This reality cannot be\r\nignored.\r\n    The penological justifications for the sentencing practice\r\nare also relevant to the analysis. Kennedy, supra, at ___\r\n(slip op., at 30–36); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571–572; Atkins,\r\nsupra, at 318–320. Criminal punishment can have differ\r\nent goals, and choosing among them is within a legisla\r\nture’s discretion. See Harmelin, supra, at 999 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J.) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment does not man\r\ndate adoption of any one penological theory”). It does not\r\nfollow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal\r\nsanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth\r\nAmendment restrictions. A sentence lacking any legiti\r\nmate penological justification is by its nature dispropor\r\ntionate to the offense. With respect to life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of\r\npenal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate—\r\nretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation,\r\nsee Ewing, 538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion)—provides\r\nan adequate justification.\r\n    Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it\r\ncannot support the sentence at issue here. Society is\r\nentitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomi\r\ncide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and\r\nto seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the\r\noffense. But “[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is\r\nthat a criminal sentence must be directly related to the\r\npersonal culpability of the criminal offender.” Tison, 481\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nU. S., at 149. And as Roper observed, “[w]hether viewed\r\nas an attempt to express the community’s moral outrage\r\nor as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the\r\nvictim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a\r\nminor as with an adult.” 543 U. S., at 571. The case\r\nbecomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did\r\nnot commit homicide. Roper found that “[r]etribution is\r\nnot proportional if the law’s most severe penalty is im\r\nposed” on the juvenile murderer. Ibid. The considerations\r\nunderlying that holding support as well the conclusion\r\nthat retribution does not justify imposing the second most\r\nsevere penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffender.\r\n   Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence ei\r\nther. Roper noted that “the same characteristics that\r\nrender juveniles less culpable than adults suggest . . . that\r\njuveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.” Ibid.\r\nBecause juveniles’ “lack of maturity and underdeveloped\r\nsense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous and\r\nill-considered actions and decisions,” Johnson v. Texas,\r\n509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a\r\npossible punishment into consideration when making\r\ndecisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is\r\nrarely imposed. That the sentence deters in a few cases is\r\nperhaps plausible, but “[t]his argument does not overcome\r\nother objections.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\r\n31). Even if the punishment has some connection to a\r\nvalid penological goal, it must be shown that the punish\r\nment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justifi\r\ncation offered. Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders’ diminished moral responsibility, any limited\r\ndeterrent effect provided by life without parole is not\r\nenough to justify the sentence.\r\n   Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprison\r\nment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in\r\nquestion here. Recidivism is a serious risk to public\r\n22                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsafety, and so incapacitation is an important goal. See\r\nEwing, supra, at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67\r\npercent of former inmates released from state prisons are\r\ncharged with at least one serious new crime within three\r\nyears). But while incapacitation may be a legitimate\r\npenological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in\r\nother contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment\r\nfor juveniles who did not commit homicide. To justify life\r\nwithout parole on the assumption that the juvenile of\r\nfender forever will be a danger to society requires the\r\nsentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorri\r\ngible. The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment\r\nquestionable. “It is difficult even for expert psychologists\r\nto differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime\r\nreflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the\r\nrare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable\r\ncorruption.” Roper, supra, at 573. As one court concluded\r\nin a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14\r\nyear-old, “incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.”\r\nWorkman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky.\r\nApp. 1968).\r\n   Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an\r\nimmediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume,\r\nserious crimes early in his term of supervised release and\r\ndespite his own assurances of reform. Graham deserved\r\nto be separated from society for some time in order to\r\nprevent what the trial court described as an “escalating\r\npattern of criminal conduct,” App. 394, but it does not\r\nfollow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his\r\nlife. Even if the State’s judgment that Graham was incor\r\nrigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or\r\nfailure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate\r\nbecause that judgment was made at the outset. A life\r\nwithout parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile\r\noffender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.\r\nIncapacitation cannot override all other considerations,\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nlest the Eighth Amendment’s rule against disproportion\r\nate sentences be a nullity.\r\n   Finally there is rehabilitation, a penological goal that\r\nforms the basis of parole systems. See Solem, 463 U. S., at\r\n300; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989).\r\nThe concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility\r\nand proper implementation are the subject of a substan\r\ntial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue. See, e.g., Cul\r\nlen & Gendreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation:\r\nPolicy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000,\r\npp. 119–133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding\r\nthe effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several\r\ndecades). It is for legislatures to determine what rehabili\r\ntative techniques are appropriate and effective.\r\n   A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, how\r\never, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The\r\npenalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By\r\ndenying the defendant the right to reenter the community,\r\nthe State makes an irrevocable judgment about that per\r\nson’s value and place in society. This judgment is not\r\nappropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender’s\r\ncapacity for change and limited moral culpability. A\r\nState’s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a\r\nmere expressive judgment. As one amicus notes, defen\r\ndants serving life without parole sentences are often de\r\nnied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative\r\nservices that are available to other inmates. See Brief for\r\nSentencing Project as Amicus Curiae 11–13. For juvenile\r\noffenders, who are most in need of and receptive to reha\r\nbilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici\r\nCuriae 28–31 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of\r\nrehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the dis\r\nproportionality of the sentence all the more evident.\r\n   In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life\r\nwithout parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This\r\ndetermination; the limited culpability of juvenile non\r\n24                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhomicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole\r\nsentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing\r\npractice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This\r\nCourt now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not\r\ncommit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the\r\nsentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary\r\nto prevent the possibility that life without parole sen\r\ntences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders\r\nwho are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punish\r\nment. Because “[t]he age of 18 is the point where society\r\ndraws the line for many purposes between childhood and\r\nadulthood,” those who were below that age when the\r\noffense was committed may not be sentenced to life with\r\nout parole for a nonhomicide crime. Roper, 543 U. S., at\r\n574.\r\n  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to\r\na juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.\r\nWhat the State must do, however, is give defendants like\r\nGraham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release\r\nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is\r\nfor the State, in the first instance, to explore the means\r\nand mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, how\r\never, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State\r\nfrom imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to\r\nrelease that offender during his natural life. Those who\r\ncommit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out\r\nto be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for\r\nthe duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does\r\nnot foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of\r\nnonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will\r\nremain behind bars for life. It does forbid States from\r\nmaking the judgment at the outset that those offenders\r\nnever will be fit to reenter society.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              C\r\n   Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is neces\r\nsary here. Two alternative approaches are not adequate\r\nto address the relevant constitutional concerns. First, the\r\nState argues that the laws of Florida and other States\r\ngoverning criminal procedure take sufficient account of\r\nthe age of a juvenile offender. Here, Florida notes that\r\nunder its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and\r\n17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious\r\nfelonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those\r\noffenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors\r\nmay not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders\r\nas adults for misdemeanors. Brief for Respondent 54\r\n(citing Fla. Stat. §985.227 (2003)). The State also stresses\r\nthat “in only the narrowest of circumstances” does Florida\r\nlaw impose no age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juve\r\nniles in adult court. Brief for Respondent 54.\r\n   Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring con\r\nsideration of a defendant’s age in charging decisions are\r\nsalutary. An offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth\r\nAmendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take\r\ndefendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be\r\nflawed. Florida, like other States, has made substantial\r\nefforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treat\r\nment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system.\r\nSee generally Fla. Stat. §958 et seq. (2007).\r\n   The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by\r\nthemselves insufficient to address the constitutional con\r\ncerns at issue. Nothing in Florida’s laws prevents its\r\ncourts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to\r\nlife without parole based on a subjective judgment that the\r\ndefendant’s crimes demonstrate an “irretrievably de\r\npraved character.” Roper, supra, at 570. This is inconsis\r\ntent with the Eighth Amendment. Specific cases are\r\nillustrative. In Graham’s case the sentencing judge de\r\ncided to impose life without parole—a sentence greater\r\n26                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthan that requested by the prosecutor—for Graham’s\r\narmed burglary conviction. The judge did so because he\r\nconcluded that Graham was incorrigible: “[Y]ou decided\r\nthat this is how you were going to lead your life and that\r\nthere is nothing that we can do for you. . . . We can’t do\r\nanything to deter you.” App. 394.\r\n   Another example comes from Sullivan v. Florida,\r\nNo. 08–7621. Sullivan was argued the same day as this\r\ncase, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certio\r\nrari in Sullivan as improvidently granted. Post, p. ___.\r\nThe facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida’s\r\nsystem. The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as\r\nan adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13\r\nyears old. Noting Sullivan’s past encounters with the law,\r\nthe sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan\r\nhad been “given opportunity after opportunity to upright\r\nhimself and take advantage of the second and third\r\nchances he’s been given,” he had demonstrated himself to\r\nbe unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away\r\nfrom society for the duration of his life. Brief for Respon\r\ndent in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009, No. 08–7621, p. 6.\r\nThe judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. As\r\nthese examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing\r\nthe imposition of these sentences based only on a discre\r\ntionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the\r\noffender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to\r\nprevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life\r\nwithout parole sentence for which he or she lacks the\r\nmoral culpability.\r\n   Another possible approach would be to hold that the\r\nEighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender’s\r\nage into consideration as part of a case-specific gross\r\ndisproportionality inquiry, weighing it against the seri\r\nousness of the crime. This approach would allow courts to\r\naccount for factual differences between cases and to im\r\npose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          27\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncrimes. Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more\r\ndifficult than sentencing. The task is usually undertaken\r\nby trial judges who seek with diligence and professional\r\nism to take account of the human existence of the offender\r\nand the just demands of a wronged society.\r\n   The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however,\r\nbe confined by some boundaries. The dilemma of juvenile\r\nsentencing demonstrates this. For even if we were to\r\nassume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might\r\nhave “sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same\r\ntime demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,” Roper, 543 U. S.,\r\nat 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not\r\nfollow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality\r\napproach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the\r\nfew incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that\r\nhave the capacity for change. Roper rejected the argument\r\nthat the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be\r\ntold they must consider the defendant’s age as a mitigat\r\ning factor in sentencing. The Court concluded that an\r\n“unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold\r\nblooded nature of any particular crime would overpower\r\nmitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of\r\ncourse, even where the juvenile offender’s objective imma\r\nturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should\r\nrequire a sentence less severe than death.” Id., at 573.\r\nHere, as with the death penalty, “[t]he differences between\r\njuvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well\r\nunderstood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive” a\r\nsentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime\r\n“despite insufficient culpability.” Id., at 572–573.\r\n   Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it\r\ndoes not take account of special difficulties encountered by\r\ncounsel in juvenile representation. As some amici note,\r\nthe features that distinguish juveniles from adults also\r\nput them at a significant disadvantage in criminal pro\r\nceedings. Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited\r\n28                  GRAHAM v.

They are less\r\nlikely than adults to work effectively with their lawyers to\r\naid in their defense.

Rev. 245, 272–273 (2005). Diffi\r\nculty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding\r\nimpulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel\r\nseen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects,\r\nall can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juve\r\nnile offense. Aber Brief 35. These factors are likely to\r\nimpair the quality of a juvenile defendant’s representa\r\ntion. Cf. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320 (“Mentally retarded\r\ndefendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance\r\nto their counsel”). A categorical rule avoids the risk that,\r\nas a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will errone\r\nously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently\r\nculpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.\r\n   Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.\r\nThe juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to\r\nachieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of hu\r\nman worth and potential. In Roper, that deprivation\r\nresulted from an execution that brought life to its end.\r\nHere, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns\r\napply. Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives\r\nno chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance\r\nfor reconciliation with society, no hope. Maturity can lead\r\nto that considered reflection which is the foundation for\r\nremorse, renewal, and rehabilitation. A young person who\r\nknows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before\r\nlife’s end has little incentive to become a responsible indi\r\nvidual. In some prisons, moreover, the system itself be\r\ncomes complicit in the lack of development. As noted\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The State has denied him any chance to\r\nlater demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based\r\nsolely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he\r\nwas a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth\r\nAmendment does not permit.\r\n                                D\r\n   There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in\r\ncontinuing to impose life without parole sentences on\r\njuveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States\r\nadheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.\r\nThis observation does not control our decision. The judg\r\nments of other nations and the international community\r\nare not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth\r\nAmendment. But “ ‘[t]he climate of international opinion\r\nconcerning the acceptability of a particular punishment’ ”\r\nis also “ ‘not irrelevant.’ ” Enmund, 458 U. S., at 796, n. 22.\r\nThe Court has looked beyond our Nation’s borders for\r\nsupport for its independent conclusion that a particular\r\npunishment is cruel and unusual. See, e.g., Roper, 543\r\nU. S., at 575–578; Atkins, supra, at 317–318, n. 21;\r\nThompson, 487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); Enmund,\r\nsupra, at 796–797, n. 22; Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10\r\n30                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n(plurality opinion); Trop, 356 U. S., at 102–103 (plurality\r\nopinion).\r\n   Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting\r\nthe global consensus against the sentencing practice in\r\nquestion. A recent study concluded that only 11 nations\r\nauthorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under\r\nany circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States\r\nand Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice. See\r\nM. Leighton & C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to\r\nDie in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An up\r\ndated version of the study concluded that Israel’s “laws\r\nallow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life\r\nterms,” but expressed reservations about how that parole\r\nreview is implemented. De la Vega & Leighton, Sentenc\r\ning Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Prac\r\ntice, 42 U. S. F. L. Rev. 983, 1002–1003 (2008). But even if\r\nIsrael is counted as allowing life without parole for juve\r\nnile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that\r\nsentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli\r\nprisoners whom commentators have identified as serving\r\nlife sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homi\r\ncide or attempted homicide. See Amnesty International,\r\nHuman Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life with\r\nout Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 106,\r\nn. 322 (2005); Memorandum and Attachment from Ruth\r\nLevush, Law Library of Congress, to Supreme Court Li\r\nbrary (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case\r\nfile).\r\n   Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not\r\ncontest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes\r\nlife without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide\r\noffenders. We also note, as petitioner and his amici em\r\nphasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Conven\r\ntion on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577\r\nU. N. T. S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by\r\nevery nation except the United States and Somalia, pro\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhibits the imposition of “life imprisonment without possi\r\nbility of release . . . for offences committed by persons\r\nbelow eighteen years of age.” Brief for Petitioner 66; Brief\r\nfor Amnesty International et al. as Amici Curiae 15–17.\r\nAs we concluded in Roper with respect to the juvenile\r\ndeath penalty, “the United States now stands alone in a\r\nworld that has turned its face against” life without parole\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders. 543 U. S., at 577.\r\n   The State’s amici stress that no international legal\r\nagreement that is binding on the United States prohibits\r\nlife without parole for juvenile offenders and thus urge us\r\nto ignore the international consensus. See Brief for Soli\r\ndarity Center for Law and Justice et al. as Amici Curiae\r\n14–16; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House\r\nof Representatives as Amici Curiae 40–43. These argu\r\nments miss the mark. The question before us is not\r\nwhether international law prohibits the United States\r\nfrom imposing the sentence at issue in this case. The\r\nquestion is whether that punishment is cruel and unusual.\r\nIn that inquiry, “the overwhelming weight of international\r\nopinion against” life without parole for nonhomicide of\r\nfenses committed by juveniles “provide[s] respected and\r\nsignificant confirmation for our own conclusions.” Roper,\r\nsupra, at 578.\r\n   The debate between petitioner’s and respondent’s amici\r\nover whether there is a binding jus cogens norm against\r\nthis sentencing practice is likewise of no import. See Brief\r\nfor Amnesty International 10–23; Brief for Sixteen Mem\r\nbers of United States House of Representatives 4–40. The\r\nCourt has treated the laws and practices of other nations\r\nand international agreements as relevant to the Eighth\r\nAmendment not because those norms are binding or con\r\ntrolling but because the judgment of the world’s nations\r\nthat a particular sentencing practice is inconsistent with\r\nbasic principles of decency demonstrates that the Court’s\r\nrationale has respected reasoning to support it.\r\n32                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                         *    *     *\r\n  The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life with\r\nout parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not\r\ncommit homicide. A State need not guarantee the offender\r\neventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must\r\nprovide him or her with some realistic opportunity to\r\nobtain release before the end of that term. The judgment\r\nof the First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirming\r\nGraham’s conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                   It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Instead, my analysis is based on an applica\r\ntion of this Court’s precedents, in particular (1) our cases\r\nrequiring “narrow proportionality” review of noncapital\r\nsentences and (2) our conclusion in Roper v. Simmons, 543\r\nU. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less\r\nculpable than adults who commit the same crimes.\r\n   These cases expressly allow courts addressing allega\r\ntions that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment to consider the particular defendant and\r\nparticular crime at issue. The standards for relief under\r\nthese precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here\r\nGraham’s juvenile status—together with the nature of his\r\ncriminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punish\r\nment imposed—lead me to conclude that his sentence of\r\nlife without parole is unconstitutional.\r\n                           I\r\n  Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply\r\nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences\r\n2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nfor noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised\r\nserious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an\r\noriginal matter, the Constitution was understood to re\r\nquire any degree of proportionality between noncapital\r\noffenses and their corresponding punishments. See, e.g.,\r\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 962–994 (1991)\r\n(principal opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 3–5, and n. 1\r\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to\r\nreexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality,\r\nhowever, and so I approach this case by trying to apply\r\nour past decisions to the facts at hand.\r\n                              A\r\n   Graham’s case arises at the intersection of two lines of\r\nEighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of deci\r\nsions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\r\nClause embraces a “narrow proportionality principle” that\r\nwe apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review\r\nnoncapital sentences. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 72\r\n(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Solem v. Helm,\r\n463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); Ewing v. California, 538 U. S.\r\n11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 996–\r\n997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\r\njudgment). This “narrow proportionality principle” does\r\nnot grant judges blanket authority to second-guess deci\r\nsions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the\r\ncontrary, a reviewing court will only “rarely” need “to\r\nengage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence\r\nis not constitutionally disproportionate,” Solem, supra, at\r\n290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and “successful challenges” to\r\nnoncapital sentences will be all the more “exceedingly\r\nrare,” Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).\r\n   We have “not established a clear or consistent path for\r\ncourts to follow” in applying the highly deferential “narrow\r\nproportionality” analysis. Lockyer, supra, at 72. We have,\r\nhowever, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsetting sentences, the variety of legitimate penological\r\nschemes, the state-by-state diversity protected by our\r\nfederal system, and the requirement that review be guided\r\nby objective, rather than subjective, factors. Ewing, supra,\r\nat 23 (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 998–1001\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Most importantly, however, we\r\nhave explained that the Eighth Amendment “ ‘does not\r\nrequire strict proportionality between crime and sen\r\ntence’ ”; rather, “ ‘it forbids only extreme sentences that are\r\n“grossly disproportionate” to the crime.’ ” Ewing, supra, at\r\n23 (plurality opinion) (quoting Harmelin, supra, at 1001\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)).\r\n   Our cases indicate that courts conducting “narrow pro\r\nportionality” review should begin with a threshold inquiry\r\nthat compares “the gravity of the offense and the harsh\r\nness of the penalty.” Solem, 463 U. S., at 290–291. This\r\nanalysis can consider a particular offender’s mental state\r\nand motive in committing the crime, the actual harm\r\ncaused to his victim or to society by his conduct, and any\r\nprior criminal history. Id., at 292–294, 296–297, and n. 22\r\n(considering motive, past criminal conduct, alcoholism,\r\nand propensity for violence of the particular defendant);\r\nsee also Ewing, supra, at 28–30 (plurality opinion) (exam\r\nining defendant’s criminal history); Harmelin, 501 U. S.,\r\nat 1001–1004 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (noting specific\r\ndetails of the particular crime of conviction).\r\n   Only in “the rare case in which a threshold comparison\r\nof the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads\r\nto an inference of gross disproportionality,” id., at 1005,\r\nshould courts proceed to an “intrajurisdictional” compari\r\nson of the sentence at issue with those imposed on other\r\ncriminals in the same jurisdiction, and an “interjurisdic\r\ntional” comparison with sentences imposed for the same\r\ncrime in other jurisdictions. Solem, supra, at 291–292. If\r\nthese subsequent comparisons confirm the inference of\r\ngross disproportionality, courts should invalidate the\r\n4                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsentence as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\r\n                              B\r\n   The second line of precedent relevant to assessing Gra\r\nham’s sentence consists of our cases acknowledging that\r\njuvenile offenders are generally—though not necessarily in\r\nevery case—less morally culpable than adults who commit\r\nthe same crimes. This insight animated our decision in\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we\r\ninvalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who\r\nhad committed his crime under the age of 16. More re\r\ncently, in Roper, 543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibi\r\ntion on executions to those who committed their crimes\r\nbefore the age of 18.\r\n   Both Thompson and Roper arose in the unique context\r\nof the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has\r\nrecognized “must be limited to those offenders who commit\r\n‘a narrow category of the most serious crimes’ and whose\r\nextreme culpability makes them ‘the most deserving of\r\nexecution.’ ” 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia,\r\n536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). Roper’s prohibition on the\r\njuvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that\r\n“[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18\r\nand adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot\r\nwith reliability be classified among the worst offenders.”\r\n543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity\r\nand an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a height\r\nened susceptibility to negative influences and outside\r\npressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is\r\n“more transitory” and “less fixed” than that of an adult.\r\nId., at 569–570. Together, these factors establish the\r\n“diminished culpability of juveniles,” id., at 571, and “ren\r\nder suspect any conclusion” that juveniles are among “the\r\nworst offenders” for whom the death penalty is reserved,\r\nid., at 570.\r\n   Today, the Court views Roper as providing the basis for\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\na new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a\r\nsentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes. I\r\ndisagree. In Roper, the Court tailored its analysis of\r\njuvenile characteristics to the specific question whether\r\njuvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to\r\ncapital punishment. Our answer that they could not be\r\nsentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion\r\nthat they “cannot with reliability be classified among the\r\nworst offenders.” Id., at 569 (emphasis added).\r\n  This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can\r\nnever be eligible for life without parole. A life sentence is\r\nof course far less severe than a death sentence, and we\r\nhave never required that it be imposed only on the very\r\nworst offenders, as we have with capital punishment.\r\nTreating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital\r\npunishment is at odds with our longstanding view that\r\n“the death penalty is different from other punishments in\r\nkind rather than degree.” Solem, supra, at 294. It is also\r\nat odds with Roper itself, which drew the line at capital\r\npunishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are “less\r\nsevere than death” despite involving “forfeiture of some of\r\nthe most basic liberties.” 543 U. S., at 573–574. Indeed,\r\nRoper explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life\r\nwithout parole on some juvenile offenders. Id., at 572.\r\n  But the fact that Roper does not support a categorical\r\nrule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean\r\nthat a criminal defendant’s age is irrelevant to those\r\nsentences. On the contrary, our cases establish that the\r\n“narrow proportionality” review applicable to noncapital\r\ncases itself takes the personal “culpability of the offender”\r\ninto account in examining whether a given punishment is\r\nproportionate to the crime. Solem, supra, at 292. There\r\nis no reason why an offender’s juvenile status should be\r\nexcluded from the analysis. Indeed, given Roper’s conclu\r\nsion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than\r\nadults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender’s juvenile status can\r\n6                        GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nplay a central role in the inquiry.\r\n   JUSTICE THOMAS disagrees with even our limited reli\r\nance on Roper on the ground that the present case does\r\nnot involve capital punishment. Post, at 26 (dissenting\r\nopinion). That distinction is important—indeed, it under\r\nlies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the\r\nCourt. But Roper’s conclusion that juveniles are typically\r\nless culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital\r\ncases, and rightly informs the case-specific inquiry I be\r\nlieve to be appropriate here.\r\n   In short, our existing precedent already provides a\r\nsufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined\r\nby the majority. Not every juvenile receiving a life sen\r\ntence will prevail under this approach. Not every juvenile\r\nshould. But all will receive the protection that the Eighth\r\nAmendment requires.\r\n                            II\r\n  Applying the “narrow proportionality” framework to the\r\nparticular facts of this case, I conclude that Graham’s\r\nsentence of life without parole violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment.*\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   * JUSTICE ALITO suggests that Graham has failed to preserve any\r\nchallenge to his sentence based on the “narrow, as-applied proportional\r\nity principle.” Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. It is true that\r\nGraham asks us to declare, categorically, that no juvenile convicted of a\r\nnonhomicide offense may ever be subject to a sentence of life without\r\nparole. But he claims that this rule is warranted under the narrow\r\nproportionality principle we set forth in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277\r\n(1983), Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), and Ewing v.\r\nCalifornia, 538 U. S. 11 (2003). Brief for Petitioner 30, 31, 54–64.\r\nInsofar as he relies on that framework, I believe we may do so as well,\r\neven if our analysis results in a narrower holding than the categori-\r\ncal rule Graham seeks. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8\r\n(“[T]he Court could rule narrowly in this case and hold only that\r\npetitioner’s sentence of life without parole was unconstitutionally\r\ndisproportionate”).\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n   I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity\r\nof Graham’s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.\r\nThere is no question that the crime for which Graham\r\nreceived his life sentence—armed burglary of a nondomicil\r\nwith an assault or battery—is “a serious crime deserving\r\nserious punishment.” Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,\r\n797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was\r\nthe basis of Graham’s probation violation. But these\r\ncrimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such\r\nas murder or rape.\r\n   As for Graham’s degree of personal culpability, he com\r\nmitted the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile—a\r\nstage at which, Roper emphasized, one’s “culpability or\r\nblameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by\r\nreason of youth and immaturity.” 543 U. S., at 571. Gra\r\nham’s age places him in a significantly different category\r\nfrom the defendants in Rummel, Harmelin, and Ewing, all\r\nof whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham’s\r\nyouth made him relatively more likely to engage in reck\r\nless and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also\r\nlikely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See,\r\ne.g., Roper, supra, at 569; Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,\r\n367 (1993); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115–117\r\n(1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should\r\nbe denied the general presumption of diminished culpabil\r\nity that Roper indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.\r\nIf anything, Graham’s in-court statements—including his\r\nrequest for a second chance so that he could “do whatever\r\nit takes to get to the NFL”—underscore his immaturity.\r\nApp. 380.\r\n   The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did\r\nproves that he was dangerous and deserved to be pun\r\nished. But it does not establish that he was particularly\r\ndangerous—at least relative to the murderers and rapists\r\nfor whom the sentence of life without parole is typically\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nreserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal con\r\nvictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult cir\r\ncumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, ante,\r\nat 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a\r\ntypical adult who commits the same offenses.\r\n   Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced\r\nGraham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\r\nThis is the second-harshest sentence available under our\r\nprecedents for any crime, and the most severe sanction\r\navailable for a nonhomicide offense. See Kennedy v. Lou\r\nisiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes,\r\nGraham’s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed\r\nby the Florida Department of Corrections (which sug\r\ngested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20),\r\nand the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced\r\nto 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).\r\nNo one in Graham’s case other than the sentencing judge\r\nappears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to\r\nprison for life.\r\n   Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that\r\nthere is a strong inference that Graham’s sentence of life\r\nimprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate\r\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed\r\nto the next steps of the proportionality analysis.\r\n                              B\r\n   Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional compari\r\nsons of Graham’s sentence confirm the threshold inference\r\nof disproportionality.\r\n   Graham’s sentence was far more severe than that im\r\nposed for similar violations of Florida law, even without\r\ntaking juvenile status into account. For example, indi\r\nviduals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Flor\r\nida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less\r\nthan 10 years, respectively.

J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\ntions in Florida 35. Unsurprisingly, Florida’s juvenile\r\ncriminals receive similarly low sentences—typically less\r\nthan five years for burglary and less than seven years for\r\nrobbery. Id., at 36. Graham’s life without parole sentence\r\nwas far more severe than the average sentence imposed on\r\nthose convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically\r\nreceive under 25 years in prison. Id., at 35. As the Court\r\nexplained in Solem, 463 U. S., at 291, “[i]f more serious\r\ncrimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious\r\npenalties, that is some indication that the punishment at\r\nissue may be excessive.”\r\n   Finally, the inference that Graham’s sentence is dispro\r\nportionate is further validated by comparison to the sen\r\ntences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions. As the\r\nmajority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its will\r\ningness to impose sentences of life without parole on juve\r\nniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes. See ante, at 11–13.\r\n                              III\r\n  So much for Graham. But what about Milagro Cun\r\nningham, a 17-year-old who beat and raped an 8-year-old\r\ngirl before leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rock in a\r\nrecycling bin in a remote landfill? See Musgrave, Cruel or\r\nNecessary? Life Terms for Youths Spur National Debate,\r\nPalm Beach Post, Oct. 15, 2009, p. 1A. Or Nathan Walker\r\nand Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together\r\nwith their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to\r\nperform oral sex on her 12-year-old son? See 3 Sentenced\r\nto Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,\r\n2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life\r\nwithout parole for his conduct says nothing whatever\r\nabout these offenders, or others like them who commit\r\nnonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the\r\nconduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham’s case as a\r\nvehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule—applicable\r\nwell beyond the particular facts of Graham’s case—that a\r\n10                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nsentence of life without parole imposed on any juvenile for\r\nany nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional. This cate\r\ngorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.\r\n   A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particu\r\nlar conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before\r\nus are not serious enough to justify Graham’s sentence.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court\r\nto decide whether that same sentence would be constitu\r\ntional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide\r\ncrimes.\r\n   A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in\r\nlight of the Court’s apparent recognition that it is perfectly\r\nlegitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life with\r\nout parole for committing murder. This means that there\r\nis nothing inherently unconstitutional about imposing\r\nsentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders;\r\nrather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on\r\nthe particular crimes for which they are imposed. But if\r\nthe constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particu\r\nlar crime being punished, then the Court should limit its\r\nholding to the particular offenses that Graham committed\r\nhere, and should decline to consider other hypothetical\r\ncrimes not presented by this case.\r\n   In any event, the Court’s categorical conclusion is also\r\nunwise. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some\r\nnonhomicide crimes—like the ones committed by Milagro\r\nCunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor—are\r\nespecially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserv\r\ning of more severe punishment.\r\n   Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have\r\n“diminished” culpability relative to adults who commit the\r\nsame crimes, Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, but that does not\r\nmean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify\r\na life sentence. See generally Thompson, 487 U. S., at 853\r\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). It does not take a\r\nmoral sense that is fully developed in every respect to\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\nknow that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leav\r\ning her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong.\r\nThe single fact of being 17 years old would not afford\r\nCunningham protection against life without parole if the\r\nyoung girl had died—as Cunningham surely expected she\r\nwould—so why should it do so when she miraculously\r\nsurvived his barbaric brutality?\r\n   The Court defends its categorical approach on the\r\ngrounds that a “clear line is necessary to prevent the\r\npossibility that life without parole sentences will be im\r\nposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not\r\nsufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.” Ante, at\r\n24. It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportional\r\nity review is constitutionally insufficient because courts\r\nmight not be able “with sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish\r\nthe few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that\r\nhave the capacity for change.” Ante, at 27.\r\n   The Court is of course correct that judges will never\r\nhave perfect foresight—or perfect wisdom—in making\r\nsentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence\r\nadults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is\r\nalso true when they sentence juveniles who commit mur\r\nder no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit\r\nother crimes.\r\n   Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying\r\ntheir reasoned judgment to each case that comes before\r\nthem. As we explained in Solem, the whole enterprise of\r\nproportionality review is premised on the “justified” as\r\nsumption that “courts are competent to judge the gravity\r\nof an offense, at least on a relative scale.” 463 U. S., at\r\n292. Indeed, “courts traditionally have made these judg\r\nments” by applying “generally accepted criteria” to analyze\r\n“the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society,\r\nand the culpability of the offender.” Id., at 292, 294.\r\n12                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\n                         *     *   *\r\n   Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which\r\nhe deserves serious punishment. But he was only 16 years\r\nold, and under our Court’s precedents, his youth is one\r\nfactor, among others, that should be considered in decid\r\ning whether his punishment was unconstitutionally exces\r\nsive. In my view, Graham’s age—together with the nature\r\nof his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his\r\nsentence—tips the constitutional balance. I thus concur in\r\nthe Court’s judgment that Graham’s sentence of life with\r\nout parole violated the Eighth Amendment.\r\n   I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in\r\nevery case involving a juvenile offender. Some crimes are\r\nso heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable,\r\nthat a sentence of life without parole may be entirely\r\njustified under the Constitution. As we have said, “suc\r\ncessful challenges” to noncapital sentences under the\r\nEighth Amendment have been—and, in my view, should\r\ncontinue to be—“exceedingly rare.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at\r\n272. But Graham’s sentence presents the exceptional case\r\nthat our precedents have recognized will come along.

Congress, the District of\r\nColumbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to con\r\nsider this sentencing practice in juvenile nonhomicide\r\ncases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it in\r\nthe very worst cases they have encountered.\r\n   The Court does not conclude that life without parole\r\nitself is a cruel and unusual punishment. It instead re\r\njects the judgments of those legislatures, judges, and\r\njuries regarding what the Court describes as the “moral”\r\nquestion of whether this sentence can ever be “propor\r\ntionat[e]” when applied to the category of offenders at\r\n2                   GRAHAM v.

Ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted),\r\nante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\r\n  I am unwilling to assume that we, as members of this\r\nCourt, are any more capable of making such moral judg\r\nments than our fellow citizens. Nothing in our training as\r\njudges qualifies us for that task, and nothing in Article III\r\ngives us that authority.\r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n   The Court recounts the facts of Terrance Jamar Gra\r\nham’s case in detail, so only a summary is necessary here.\r\nAt age 16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked\r\naccomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida\r\nrestaurant, during which one of Graham’s accomplices\r\ntwice struck the restaurant manager on the head with a\r\nsteel pipe when he refused to turn over money to the\r\nintruders. Graham was arrested and charged as an adult.\r\nHe later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including armed\r\nburglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable by\r\nlife imprisonment under Florida law.           Fla. Stat.\r\n§§810.02(2)(a), 810.02(2)(b) (2007). The trial court with\r\nheld adjudication on both counts, however, and sentenced\r\nGraham to probation, the first 12 months of which he\r\nspent in a county detention facility.\r\n   Graham reoffended just six months after his release. At\r\na probation revocation hearing, a judge found by a pre\r\nponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11\r\nmonths, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices\r\nand held the homeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30\r\nminutes while his accomplices ransacked the residence.\r\nAs a result, the judge concluded that Graham had violated\r\nhis probation and, after additional hearings, adjudicated\r\nGraham guilty on both counts arising from the restaurant\r\nrobbery. The judge imposed the maximum sentence al\r\nlowed by Florida law on the armed burglary count, life\r\n                Cite as: 560 U.

Michigan, 501\r\nU. S. 957, 979 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (quoting\r\nGranucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments In\r\nflicted”: The Original Meaning, 57 Cal. L. Rev. 839, 842\r\n(1969))—specifically methods akin to those that had been\r\nconsidered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of\r\nRights was adopted, Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008)\r\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable\r\nexception, see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349\r\n(1910); Harmelin, supra, at 990–994 (opinion of\r\nSCALIA, J.) (discussing the scope and relevance of Weems’\r\nholding), this Court applied the Clause with that under\r\nstanding for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amend\r\nment’s ratification.\r\n   More recently, however, the Court has held that the\r\nClause authorizes it to proscribe not only methods of\r\npunishment that qualify as “cruel and unusual,” but also\r\nany punishment that the Court deems “grossly dispropor\r\ntionate” to the crime committed. Ante, at 8 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). This latter interpretation is\r\n4                       GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nentirely the Court’s creation. As has been described else\r\nwhere at length, there is virtually no indication that the\r\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause originally was\r\nunderstood to require proportionality in sentencing. See\r\nHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 975–985 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\r\nHere, it suffices to recall just two points. First, the Clause\r\ndoes not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any\r\nsynonym for that term, even though the Framers were\r\nfamiliar with the concept, as evidenced by several found\r\ning-era state constitutions that required (albeit without\r\ndefining) proportional punishments. See id., at 977–978.\r\nIn addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Con\r\ngress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was\r\nnot considered a constitutional command.1 See id., at\r\n980–981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital pun\r\nishment for offenses ranging from “ ‘run[ning] away with\r\n. . . goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars,’ ” to\r\n“murder on the high seas” (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also\r\nPreyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An\r\nOverview, 26 Am.

I disagree. Both the Court and\r\nthe concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality\r\nprecedents to the particulars of Graham’s claim. The Court radically\r\ndeparts from the framework those precedents establish by applying to a\r\nnoncapital sentence the categorical proportionality review its prior\r\ndecisions have reserved for death penalty cases alone. See Part III,\r\ninfra. The concurrence, meanwhile, breathes new life into the case-by\r\ncase proportionality approach that previously governed noncapital\r\ncases, from which the Court has steadily, and wisely, retreated since\r\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). See Part IV, infra. In dissenting\r\nfrom both choices to expand proportionality review, I find it essential to\r\nreexamine the foundations on which that doctrine is built.\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opin\r\nion) (rape of an adult woman); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554\r\nU. S. ___ (2008) (rape of a child); Enmund v. Florida, 458\r\nU. S. 782 (1982) (felony murder in which the defendant\r\nparticipated in the felony but did not kill or intend to kill);\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988) (plurality\r\nopinion) (juveniles under 16); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.\r\n551 (2005) (juveniles under 18); Atkins v. Virginia, 536\r\nU. S. 304 (2002) (mentally retarded offenders). In adopting\r\nthese categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes\r\nupon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state\r\nand federal) organs of government. The Eighth Amend\r\nment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and\r\nunusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other\r\nconstitutional provisions ensure the defendant’s right to\r\nfair process before any punishment is imposed. But, as\r\nmembers of today’s majority note, “[s]ociety changes,” ante,\r\nat 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment\r\nleaves the unavoidably moral question of who “deserves” a\r\nparticular nonprohibited method of punishment to the\r\njudgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the\r\nprosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that\r\nimpose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.\r\n   The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules\r\nthat shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from\r\nthe death penalty on the theory that “evolving standards\r\nof decency” require this result. Ante, at 7 (internal quota\r\ntion marks omitted). The Court has offered assurances\r\nthat these standards can be reliably measured by “ ‘objec\r\n6                    GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntive indicia’ ” of “national consensus,” such as state and\r\nfederal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given\r\nthat we are talking about “national” consensus) interna\r\ntional opinion. Ante, at 10 (quoting Roper, supra, at 563);\r\nsee also ante, at 10–16, 29–31. Yet even assuming that is\r\ntrue, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality\r\nof a particular type of punishment to turn on a “snapshot\r\nof American public opinion” taken at the moment a case\r\nis decided. Roper, supra, at 629 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\nBy holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one\r\ndirection the evolution of the standards it describes, thus\r\n“calling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pen\r\ndulum swing in social attitudes,” Thompson, supra, at\r\n869 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and “stunt[ing] legislative\r\nconsideration” of new questions of penal policy as they\r\nemerge, Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (ALITO, J.,\r\ndissenting).\r\n   But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of\r\ncommunity consensus in any event. Ante, at 16 (“Commu\r\nnity consensus, while ‘entitled to great weight,’ is not itself\r\ndeterminative” (quoting Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at\r\n24))). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence\r\nof consensus it finds whenever its own “independent judg\r\nment” points in a different direction. Ante, at 16. The\r\nCourt thus openly claims the power not only to approve or\r\ndisapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on\r\nevidence of how society’s standards have evolved, but also\r\non the basis of the Court’s “independent” perception of\r\nhow those standards should evolve, which depends on\r\nwhat the Court concedes is “ ‘ “necessarily . . . a moral\r\njudgment” ’ ” regarding the propriety of a given punish\r\nment in today’s society. Ante, at 7 (quoting Kennedy,\r\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).\r\n   The categorical proportionality review the Court em\r\nploys in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.\r\nThe Court’s decision today is significant because it does\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nnot merely apply this standard—it remarkably expands its\r\nreach. For the first time in its history, the Court declares\r\nan entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital\r\nsentence using the categorical approach it previously\r\nreserved for death penalty cases alone.\r\n                                B\r\n   Until today, the Court has based its categorical propor\r\ntionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives\r\nspecial protection to capital defendants because the death\r\npenalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be\r\nreserved for only those who are “most deserving of execu\r\ntion.” Atkins, supra, at 319; see Roper, supra, at 568;\r\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v.\r\nOhio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).           Of course, the Eighth\r\nAmendment itself makes no distinction between capital\r\nand noncapital sentencing, but the “ ‘bright line’ ” the\r\nCourt drew between the two penalties has for many years\r\nserved as the principal justification for the Court’s will\r\ningness to reject democratic choices regarding the death\r\npenalty. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).\r\n   Today’s decision eviscerates that distinction. “Death is\r\ndifferent” no longer. The Court now claims not only the\r\npower categorically to reserve the “most severe punish\r\nment” for those the Court thinks are “ ‘the most deserving\r\nof execution,’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins,\r\n536 U. S., at 319), but also to declare that “less culpable”\r\npersons are categorically exempt from the “second most\r\nsevere penalty.” Ante, at 21 (emphasis added). No reli\r\nable limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from\r\nimmunizing any class of offenders from the law’s third,\r\nfourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.\r\n   The Court’s departure from the “death is different”\r\ndistinction is especially mystifying when one considers\r\nhow long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a\r\ntime the Court declined to apply proportionality principles\r\n8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nto noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that “a sen\r\ntence of death differs in kind from any sentence of impris\r\nonment, no matter how long.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at 272\r\n(emphasis added). Based on that rationale, the Court\r\nfound that the excessiveness of one prison term as com\r\npared to another was “properly within the province of\r\nlegislatures, not courts,” id., at 275–276, precisely because\r\nit involved an “invariably . . . subjective determination,\r\nthere being no clear way to make ‘any constitutional dis\r\ntinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer\r\nterm of years,’ ” Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370, 373 (1982)\r\n(per curiam) (quoting Rummel, supra, at 275; emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n   Even when the Court broke from that understanding in\r\nits 5-to-4 decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983)\r\n(striking down as “grossly disproportionate” a life-without\r\nparole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a\r\nworthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the\r\nfacts of that case; it announced no categorical rule. Id., at\r\n288, 303. Moreover, the Court soon cabined Solem’s ra\r\ntionale. The controlling opinion in the Court’s very next\r\nnoncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles\r\nof federalism require substantial deference to legislative\r\nchoices regarding the proper length of prison sentences.\r\nHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\r\n(“[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of\r\nsentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms\r\nare the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal\r\nstructure”); id., at 1000 (“[D]iffering attitudes and percep\r\ntions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational,\r\nconclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison\r\nterms for particular crimes”). That opinion thus concluded\r\nthat “successful challenges to the proportionality of\r\n[prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.” Id., at\r\n1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years since\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nSolem, the Court has considered just three such chal\r\nlenges and has rejected them all, see Ewing v. California,\r\n538 U. S. 11 (2003); Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63\r\n(2003); Harmelin, supra, largely on the theory that criti\r\ncisms of the “wisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness” of\r\nterm-of-years prison sentences are “appropriately directed\r\nat the legislature[s],” not the courts, Ewing, supra, at 27,\r\n28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that\r\nthose decisions were “closely divided,” ante, at 8, but so\r\nwas Solem itself, and it is now fair to describe Solem as an\r\noutlier.2\r\n   Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to\r\nSolem’s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapi\r\ntal sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a categorical\r\nproportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences\r\nnot just in this case, but in every case involving a juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.\r\nNeither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court’s prece\r\ndents justify this decision.\r\n                            III\r\n  The Court asserts that categorical proportionality re\r\nview is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a\r\ncategorical rule, see ante, at 10, and because the Court\r\n——————\r\n  2 Courts  and commentators interpreting this Court’s decisions have\r\nreached this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Polk, 546 F. 3d 74,\r\n76 (CA1 2008) (“[I]nstances of gross disproportionality [in noncapital\r\ncases] will be hen’s-teeth rare”); Barkow, The Court of Life and Death:\r\nThe Two Tracks of Constitutional Sentencing Law and the Case for\r\nUniformity, 107 Mich.

FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthinks clear lines are a good idea, see ante, at 25. I find\r\nthose factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court’s\r\nbreak from past practice. First, the Court fails to ac\r\nknowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire\r\ncategory of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a\r\nmuch heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief\r\nunder Solem. Unlike the petitioner in Solem, Graham\r\nmust establish not only that his own life-without-parole\r\nsentence is “grossly disproportionate,” but also that such a\r\nsentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is\r\napplied to a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how\r\nheinous his crime. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.\r\n739 (1987). Second, even applying the Court’s categorical\r\n“evolving standards” test, neither objective evidence of\r\nnational consensus nor the notions of culpability on which\r\nthe Court’s “independent judgment” relies can justify the\r\ncategorical rule it declares here.\r\n                              A\r\n  According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment\r\nanalysis “begins with objective indicia of national consen\r\nsus,”3 and “[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evi\r\ndence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by\r\nthe country’s legislatures,” ante, at 10–11 (internal quota\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  3 The Court ignores entirely the threshold inquiry of whether subject\r\n\r\ning juvenile offenders to adult penalties was one of the “modes or acts of\r\npunishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time\r\nthat the Bill of Rights was adopted.” Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\r\n399, 405 (1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the\r\nevidence is clear that, at the time of the Founding, “the common law set\r\na rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the age\r\nof 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to be\r\nimposed on a person as young as age 7.” Stanford v. Kentucky, 492\r\nU. S. 361, 368 (1989) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *23–*24; 1\r\nM. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 24–29 (1800)). It thus seems exceedingly\r\nunlikely that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a\r\nperson of Graham’s age would run afoul of those standards.\r\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

As such, the analysis should end\r\nquickly, because a national “consensus” in favor of the\r\nCourt’s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50\r\nStates, the Federal Government, and the District of Co\r\nlumbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be\r\ntried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.4 See\r\nante, at 33–35 (Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty\r\nfive States, the Federal Government, and the District of\r\nColumbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court\r\nto the very same range of punishments faced by adults\r\ncharged with the same crimes. See ante, at 33–34, Part I.\r\nEight of those States do not make life-without-parole\r\nsentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regard\r\nless of age.5 All remaining jurisdictions—the Federal\r\nGovernment, the other 37 States, and the District—\r\nauthorize life-without-parole sentences for certain non\r\nhomicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such\r\nsentences on persons under 18. See ibid. Only five States\r\n——————\r\n  4 Although  the details of state laws vary extensively, they generally\r\npermit the transfer of a juvenile offender to adult court through one or\r\nmore of the following mechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the\r\njuvenile court has the authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender\r\nand transfer the case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in\r\nwhich adult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases\r\nand the prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3) statutory\r\nprovisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain crimes from\r\njuvenile-court jurisdiction.

The sole fact that federal law author\r\nizes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our\r\nNation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality\r\nthat 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit\r\nthe practice makes the claim utterly implausible. Not only\r\nis there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear\r\nlegislative consensus in favor of its availability.\r\n    Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence\r\naside as “incomplete and unavailing,” declaring that\r\n“ ‘[t]here are measures of consensus other than legisla\r\ntion.’ ” Ante, at 11 (quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\r\nop., at 22)). This is nothing short of stunning. Most im\r\nportantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing\r\npractice.7 And although the Court has never decided how\r\nmany state laws are necessary to show consensus, the\r\nCourt has never banished into constitutional exile a sen\r\ntencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a\r\nsupermajority, of States expressly permit.8\r\n——————\r\n  6 Colo.

S., at 315–316; Roper, 543 U. S., at 565–566—\r\nunderscores the consensus against the rule the Court\r\nannounces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a\r\nnational consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a\r\nconsensus in favor of the two penological points it later\r\ndiscusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than\r\nsimilarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit\r\nnonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity\r\nto demonstrate rehabilitation through parole. Ante, at 17–\r\n18, 23–25. But legislative trends make that assumption\r\nuntenable.\r\n  First, States over the past 20 years have consistently\r\nincreased the severity of punishments for juvenile offend\r\ners. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the\r\n1990’s as “a time of unprecedented change as State legis\r\n——————\r\npunishment for the rape of a child where only six States had enacted\r\nstatutes authorizing the punishment since Furman v.

Virginia, 536 U.

(noting\r\nthat, during that period, “legislatures in 47 States and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile\r\njustice systems more punitive,” principally by “ma[king] it\r\neasier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile\r\njustice system to the [adult] criminal justice system”); id.,\r\nat 104. This, in my view, reveals the States’ widespread\r\nagreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same\r\nculpability as adults and that the law should permit\r\njudges and juries to consider adult sentences—including\r\nlife without parole—in those rare and unfortunate cases.\r\nSee Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal\r\nResponsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law & Family\r\nStudies 11, 69–70 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole\r\nsentences for juveniles have increased since the 1980’s);\r\nAmnesty International & Human Rights Watch, The Rest\r\nof Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in\r\nthe United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).\r\n   Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over\r\nthe same period. Congress abolished parole for federal\r\noffenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to\r\n“gamesmanship and cynicism,” Breyer, Federal Sentenc\r\ning Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180\r\n(1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\r\nStat. 1987), and several States have followed suit, see T.\r\nHughes, D. Wilson, & A. Beck, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\r\nJustice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990–2000, p. 1\r\n(2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had\r\nabolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States\r\nhad abolished it for certain ones). In light of these devel\r\nopments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus\r\nthat parole must be available to offenders less than 18\r\nyears old in every nonhomicide case simply fails.\r\n                            B\r\n     The Court nonetheless dismisses existing legislation,\r\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Based on this rarity of\r\nuse, the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice,\r\nimplying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus\r\nof a prior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures\r\ntone-deaf to moral values of their constituents that this\r\nCourt claims to have easily discerned from afar. See ante,\r\nat 11.\r\n   This logic strains credulity. It has been rejected before.\r\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 182 (1976) (joint opinion\r\nof Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (“[T]he relative\r\n——————\r\n   9 I say “recent memory” because the research relied upon by the Court\r\n\r\nprovides a headcount of juvenile nonhomicide offenders presently\r\nincarcerated in this country, but does not provide more specific infor\r\nmation about all of the offenders, such as the dates on which they were\r\nconvicted.\r\n   10 When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a letter the Court had\r\n\r\nrequested from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which stated that there\r\nwere six juvenile nonhomicide offenders then serving life-without\r\nparole sentences in the federal system. After the Court released its\r\nopinion, the Acting Solicitor General disputed the BOP’s calculations\r\nand stated that none of those six offenders was serving a life without\r\nparole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime completed\r\nbefore the age of 18. See Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting\r\nSolicitor General, U. S. Dept. of Justice, to Clerk of the Supreme Court\r\n(May 24, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (noting that five\r\nof the six inmates were convicted for participation in unlawful con\r\nspiracies that began when they were juveniles but continued after they\r\nreached the age of 18, and noting that the sixth inmate was convicted of\r\nmurder as a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and\r\nCorrupt Organizations Act). The Court has amended its opinion in\r\nlight of the Acting Solicitor General’s letter. In my view, the inconsis\r\ntency between the BOP’s classification of these six offenders and the\r\nSolicitor General’s is irrelevant. The fact remains that federal law, and\r\nthe laws of a supermajority of States, permit this sentencing practice.\r\nAnd, as will be explained, see infra this page and 16–20, judges and\r\njurors have chosen to impose this sentence in the very worst cases they\r\nhave encountered.\r\n16                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ninfrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence\r\ndoes not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se.\r\nRather, [it] . . . may well reflect the humane feeling that\r\nthis most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a\r\nsmall number of extreme cases”). It should also be re\r\njected here. That a punishment is rarely imposed demon\r\nstrates nothing more than a general consensus that it\r\nshould be just that—rarely imposed. It is not proof that\r\nthe punishment is one the Nation abhors.\r\n   The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that\r\nauthorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating\r\na juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole\r\nsentence, cannot be counted as approving its use. The\r\nmere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this pen\r\nalty, the Court explains, “does not indicate that the pen\r\nalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and\r\nfull legislative consideration.” Ante, at 16.\r\n   But this misapplies the Court’s own evolving standards\r\ntest. Under that test, “[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to\r\nestablish a national consensus approving what their citi\r\nzens have voted to do; rather, it is the ‘heavy burden’ of\r\npetitioners to establish a national consensus against it.”\r\nStanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (quoting\r\nGregg, supra, at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\r\nSTEVENS, JJ.); some emphasis added). In light of this fact,\r\nthe Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction’s disuse of a\r\nlegislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition\r\nto it. The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this\r\nsentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the\r\ncitizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility\r\nthat a jury of their peers could impose a life-without\r\nparole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is\r\nsufficiently depraved.\r\n   The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illus\r\ntrates this point. Just weeks before the release of this\r\nopinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life with\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nout parole after hearing evidence that he viciously at\r\ntacked a 17-year-old girl who gave him a ride home from a\r\nparty. See Stogsdill, Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing,\r\nRape Case, Tulsa World, Apr. 2, 2010, p. A10; Stogsdill,\r\nDelaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case,\r\nTulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12. Budder allegedly put\r\nthe girl’s head “ ‘into a headlock and sliced her throat,’ ”\r\nraped her, stabbed her about 20 times, beat her, and\r\npounded her face into the rocks alongside a dirt road.\r\nTeen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, at A10.\r\nMiraculously, the victim survived. Ibid.\r\n   Budder’s crime was rare in its brutality. The sentence\r\nthe jury imposed was also rare. According to the study\r\nrelied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such offender\r\nin its prison system before Budder’s offense. P. Annino, D.\r\nRasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for\r\nNon-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14\r\n(Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, there\r\nfore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma’s citizens as\r\nmorally opposed to life-without-parole sentences for juve\r\nniles nonhomicide offenders.\r\n   Yet Oklahoma’s experience proves the inescapable flaw\r\nin that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws\r\nthat allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole\r\nsentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries\r\ninvoke those laws rarely—in the unusual cases that they\r\nfind exceptionally depraved. I cannot agree with the\r\nCourt that Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally\r\ndisabled from using this sentencing practice merely be\r\ncause they have not done so more frequently. If anything,\r\nthe rarity of this penalty’s use underscores just how judi\r\ncious sentencing judges and juries across the country have\r\nbeen in invoking it.\r\n   This fact is entirely consistent with the Court’s intuition\r\nthat juveniles generally are less culpable and more capable\r\nof growth than adults. See infra, at 21–22. Graham’s own\r\n18                       GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase provides another example. Graham was statutorily\r\neligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first\r\ncrime. But the record indicates that the trial court did not\r\ngive such a sentence serious consideration at Graham’s\r\ninitial plea hearing. It was only after Graham subse\r\nquently violated his parole by invading a home at gun\r\npoint that the maximum sentence was imposed.\r\n   In sum, the Court’s calculation that 123 juvenile non\r\nhomicide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed\r\nnationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly\r\namounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice\r\noffends our common sense of decency.11\r\n——————\r\n  11 Because  existing legislation plainly suffices to refute any consensus\r\nagainst this sentencing practice, I assume the accuracy of the Court’s\r\nevidence regarding the frequency with which this sentence has been\r\nimposed. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about\r\nthe Court’s figures. First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those\r\njuveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis\r\nall juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (e.g., 70 or 80\r\nyears’ imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury\r\nimposing such a long sentence—which effectively denies the offender\r\nany material opportunity for parole—would express moral outrage at a\r\nlife-without-parole sentence.\r\n   Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the\r\nCourt’s analysis, the statistical information presently available would\r\nbe woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule\r\nthat can be revoked only by constitutional amendment. The only\r\nevidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sen\r\ntence’s imposition was a single study completed after this Court\r\ngranted certiorari in this case. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, & C.\r\nRice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida\r\nCompared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to\r\nquestion the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the\r\nstudy itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its\r\nkind. See id., at 1. The Court’s questionable decision to “complete” the\r\nstudy on its own does not materially increase its reliability. For one\r\nthing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from\r\never disputing its findings. Complicating matters further, the original\r\nstudy sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the\r\nStates themselves, see ibid.; the study has never been peer reviewed;\r\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    19\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the\r\nCourt finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case\r\nare stronger than those supporting at least one other\r\npenalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court,\r\njoined by the author of today’s opinion, upheld the applica\r\ntion of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the\r\nfact that no such punishment had been carried out on a\r\nperson of that age in this country in nearly 30 years. See\r\nStanford, 492 U. S., at 374. Whatever the statistical\r\nfrequency with which life-without-parole sentences have\r\nbeen imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the\r\nlast 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.\r\n   In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation\r\nand the frequency of a penalty’s use are merely ornaments\r\nin the Court’s analysis, window dressing that accompanies\r\nits judicial fiat.12 By the Court’s own decree, “[c]ommunity\r\n——————\r\nand specific data on all 123 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of\r\nconviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification of the\r\nCourt’s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames Florida\r\nfor all of this. See ante, at 12. But as already noted, it is not Florida’s\r\nburden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this\r\nsentencing practice, but Graham’s “heavy burden” to prove a consensus\r\nagainst it. See supra, at 16.\r\n  12 I confine to a footnote the Court’s discussion of foreign laws and\r\n\r\nsentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such\r\nfactors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court’s\r\ndiscernment of any longstanding tradition in this Nation. See Atkins,\r\n536 U. S., at 324–325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Here, two points\r\nsuffice. First, despite the Court’s attempt to count the actual number of\r\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in\r\nother nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within\r\nour borders), the laws of other countries permit juvenile life-without\r\nparole sentences, see Child Rights Information, Network, C. de la Vega,\r\nM. Montesano, & A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on\r\nJuvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3,\r\n2009) (“Eleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the\r\nsentencing of child offenders to life without the possibility of release,”\r\nonline at http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as\r\nvisited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)).\r\n20                      GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nconsensus . . . is not itself determinative.” Ante, at 16.\r\nOnly the independent moral judgment of this Court is\r\nsufficient to decide the question. See ibid.\r\n                              C\r\n  Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court\r\nshifts to the heart of its argument: its “independent judg\r\nment” that this sentencing practice does not “serv[e] legiti\r\nmate penological goals.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court begins\r\nthat analysis with the obligatory preamble that “ ‘[t]he\r\nEighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one\r\npenological theory,’ ” ante, at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501\r\nU. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), then promptly\r\nmandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems\r\nbest.\r\n  First, the Court acknowledges that, at a minimum, the\r\nimposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile\r\nnonhomicide offenders serves two “legitimate” penological\r\ngoals: incapacitation and deterrence. Ante, at 21–23. By\r\ndefinition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation\r\nby ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed\r\nburglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex\r\ncrimes described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, no longer\r\nthreaten their communities. See ante, at 9 (opinion con\r\ncurring in judgment). That should settle the matter, since\r\nthe Court acknowledges that incapacitation is an “impor\r\ntant” penological goal. Ante, at 22. Yet, the Court finds\r\nthis goal “inadequate” to justify the life-without-parole\r\nsentences here. Ante, at 22 (emphasis added). A similar\r\nfate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such\r\nsentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to\r\n——————\r\nSecond, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the\r\nworld remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile\r\noffenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself\r\namong the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making\r\nthat choice.\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsome degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as\r\nillegitimate, but as insufficient. Ante, at 21 (“[A]ny limited\r\ndeterrent effect provided by life without parole is not\r\nenough to justify the sentence.” (emphasis added)).\r\n   The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but\r\nlaments that life-without-parole sentences do little to\r\npromote this goal because they result in the offender’s\r\npermanent incarceration. Ante, at 23. Of course, the\r\nCourt recognizes that rehabilitation’s “utility and proper\r\nimplementation” are subject to debate. Ante, at 23. But\r\nthat does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may\r\nnot “forswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.” Ibid. In other\r\nwords, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate “any one\r\npenological theory,” ante, at 20 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), just one the Court approves.\r\n   Ultimately, however, the Court’s “independent judg\r\nment” and the proportionality rule itself center on retribu\r\ntion—the notion that a criminal sentence should be pro\r\nportioned to “ ‘the personal culpability of the criminal\r\noffender.’ ” Ante, at 16, 20–21 (quoting Tison v. Arizona,\r\n481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987)). The Court finds that retribu\r\ntive purposes are not served here for two reasons.\r\n                             1\r\n  First, quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 569–570, the Court\r\nconcludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults\r\nbecause, as compared to adults, they “have a ‘ “lack of\r\nmaturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” ’ ”\r\nand “their characters are ‘not as well formed.’ ” Ante, at\r\n17. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consis\r\ntent with the evidence recounted above that judges and\r\njuries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently,\r\ndespite legislative authorization to do so in many more\r\ncases. See Part III–B, supra. Our society tends to treat\r\nthe average juvenile as less culpable than the average\r\nadult. But the question here does not involve the average\r\n22                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\njuvenile. The question, instead, is whether the Constitu\r\ntion prohibits judges and juries from ever concluding that\r\nan offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated suffi\r\ncient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his perma\r\nnent incarceration.\r\n   In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the\r\nCourt cites “developments in psychology and brain sci\r\nence” indicating that juvenile minds “continue to mature\r\nthrough late adolescence,” ante, at 17 (citing Brief for\r\nAmerican Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–\r\n24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as\r\nAmici Curiae 22–27 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that\r\njuveniles are “more likely [than adults] to engage in risky\r\nbehaviors,” id., at 7. But even if such generalizations from\r\nsocial science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking,\r\nthe Court misstates the data on which it relies.\r\n   The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial\r\nnumber of youths to engage in “risky” or antisocial behav\r\niors with the propensity of a much smaller group to com\r\nmit violent crimes. Ante, at 25–29. But research relied\r\nupon by the amici cited in the Court’s opinion differenti\r\nates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a\r\nfleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pat\r\ntern. See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-Course-\r\nPersistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxon\r\nomy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA\r\nBrief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who\r\nare “antisocial only during adolescence” and a smaller\r\ngroup who engage in antisocial behavior “at every life\r\nstage” despite “drift[ing] through successive systems\r\naimed at curbing their deviance”). That research further\r\nsuggests that the pattern of behavior in the latter group\r\noften sets in before 18. See Moffitt, supra, at 684 (“The\r\nwell-documented resistance of antisocial personality dis\r\norder to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the\r\nlife-course-persistent style is fixed sometime before age\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n18”). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evi\r\ndence that an adolescent offender’s antisocial behavior is\r\nnot transient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the\r\nTaxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-\r\nLimited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status\r\nof Criminological Theory 277, 292–293 (F. Cullen, J.\r\nWright, & K. Blevins eds. 2006) (observing that “life\r\ncourse persistent” males “tended to specialize in serious\r\noffenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault, robbery,\r\nviolating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited” ones\r\n“specialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5,\r\npublic drunkenness, giving false information on applica\r\ntion forms, pirating computer software, etc.)”).\r\n   In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this psychologi\r\ncal or sociological data is sufficient to support the Court’s\r\n“ ‘moral’ ” conclusion that youth defeats culpability in every\r\ncase. Ante, at 18 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570); see\r\nid., at 618 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case\r\nAgainst Adolescence 171 (2007) (reporting on a study of\r\njuvenile reasoning skills and concluding that “most teens\r\nare capable of conventional, adult-like moral reasoning”).\r\n   The Court responds that a categorical rule is nonethe\r\nless necessary to prevent the “ ‘unacceptable likelihood’ ”\r\nthat a judge or jury, unduly swayed by “ ‘the brutality or\r\ncold-blooded nature’ ” of a juvenile’s nonhomicide crime,\r\nwill sentence him to a life-without-parole sentence for\r\nwhich he possesses “ ‘insufficient culpability,’ ” ante, at 27\r\n(quoting Roper, supra, at 572–573). I find that justifica\r\ntion entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal\r\njustice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand\r\nbetween the defendant and an outraged public and dispas\r\nsionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of\r\npunishment based on the evidence presented. That proc\r\ness necessarily admits of human error. But so does the\r\nprocess of judging in which we engage. As between the\r\ntwo, I find far more “unacceptable” that this Court,\r\n24                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nswayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of\r\nyouth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to\r\ndecide for themselves when the rare case requires differ\r\nent treatment.\r\n                                2\r\n   That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does\r\nnot even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile\r\nmind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today\r\nwould be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and\r\nfederal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for\r\njuveniles who commit homicides. See ante, at 18–19. The\r\nCourt thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in\r\nthe psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from\r\nacquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life\r\nwithout-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects over\r\nwhelming legislative consensus only on the question of\r\nwhich acts are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.\r\n   The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old\r\nwho pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate suffi\r\ncient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry\r\ninto society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8\r\nyear-old and leaves her for dead does not. See ante, at 17–\r\n19; cf. ante, at 9 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)\r\n(describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Mi\r\nlagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court’s conclusion that\r\nlife-without-parole sentences are “grossly disproportion\r\nate” for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very\r\nlittle to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do\r\nwith its perception that “defendants who do not kill, in\r\ntend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categori\r\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish\r\nment than are murderers.” Ante, at 18.\r\n   That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting\r\nconstraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such\r\nan untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nquestion of what acts are “deserving” of what punishments\r\nis bound so tightly with questions of morality and social\r\nconditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question\r\nfor legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previ\r\nously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding\r\ncertain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capi\r\ntal punishment. See supra, at 4. But never before today\r\nhas the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to\r\nimpose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser\r\npunishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established\r\nboundary raises the question whether any democratic\r\nchoice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the\r\nCourt’s ever-expanding constitutional veto.\r\n                            IV\r\n   Although the concurrence avoids the problems associ\r\nated with expanding categorical proportionality review to\r\nnoncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality\r\nanalysis in a way that raises the same fundamental\r\nconcern. Although I do not believe Solem merits stare\r\ndecisis treatment, Graham’s claim cannot prevail even\r\nunder that test (as it has been limited by the Court’s\r\nsubsequent precedents). Solem instructs a court first to\r\ncompare the “gravity” of an offender’s conduct to the\r\n“harshness of the penalty” to determine whether an\r\n“inference” of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S.,\r\nat 290–291. Only in “the rare case” in which such an\r\ninference is present should the court proceed to the “ob\r\njective” part of the inquiry—an intra- and interjurisdic\r\ntional comparison of the defendant’s sentence with others\r\nsimilarly situated. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\r\n   Under the Court’s precedents, I fail to see how an “in\r\nference” of gross disproportionality arises here. The con\r\ncurrence notes several arguably mitigating facts—\r\nGraham’s “lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and\r\n26                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nimmaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbring\r\ning.” Ante, at 7 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment).\r\nBut the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole\r\nsentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a\r\nnonviolent drug crime. See Harmelin, supra, at 1002–\r\n1004. Graham’s conviction for an actual violent felony is\r\nsurely more severe than that offense. As for Graham’s\r\nage, it is true that Roper held juveniles categorically ineli\r\ngible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence ex\r\nplains, Roper was based on the “explicit conclusion that\r\n[juveniles] ‘cannot with reliability be classified among the\r\nworst offenders’ ”; it did “not establish that juveniles can\r\nnever be eligible for life without parole.” Ante, at 5\r\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Roper,\r\n543 U. S., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of ROBERTS,\r\nC. J.)). In my view, Roper’s principles are thus not gener\r\nally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.\r\n   By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the\r\nsame type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it\r\nrestrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical\r\nruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham\r\n“the general presumption of diminished culpability” for\r\njuveniles, ante, at 7, apparently because it believes that\r\nGraham’s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were\r\n“certainly less serious” than murder or rape, ibid. It\r\nrecoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend\r\nthe same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex\r\ncrime. See ante, at 10. I simply cannot accept that these\r\nsubjective judgments of proportionality are ones the\r\nEighth Amendment authorizes us to make.\r\n   The “objective” elements of the Solem test provide no\r\nadditional support for the concurrence’s conclusion. The\r\nconcurrence compares Graham’s sentence to “similar”\r\nsentences in Florida and concludes that Graham’s sen\r\ntence was “far more severe.” Ante, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J,\r\nconcurring in judgment). But strangely, the concurrence\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nuses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as\r\nexamples of “similar” offenses, even though it seems that a\r\nrun-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to\r\nGraham’s criminal history, which includes a charge for\r\narmed burglary with assault, and a probation violation for\r\ninvading a home at gunpoint.\r\n   And even if Graham’s sentence is higher than ones he\r\nmight have received for an armed burglary with assault in\r\nother jurisdictions, see ante, at 8–9, this hardly seems\r\nrelevant if one takes seriously the principle that “ ‘[a]bsent\r\na constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to tradi\r\ntional notions of federalism, some State will always bear\r\nthe distinction of treating particular offenders more se\r\nverely than any other State.’ ” Harmelin, supra, at 1000\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Rummel, 445 U. S., at\r\n282; emphasis added). Applying Solem, the Court has\r\nupheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under Califor\r\nnia’s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and\r\nits amici could cite only “a single instance of a similar\r\nsentence imposed outside the context of California’s three\r\nstrikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching\r\ntwo million individuals.” Ewing, 538 U. S., at 47 (BREYER,\r\nJ., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole\r\nsentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan\r\ncharged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the\r\nfact that only one other State would have authorized such\r\na stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that\r\nState required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilo\r\ngrams) to trigger the penalty. See Harmelin, supra, at\r\n1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham’s sentence is cer\r\ntainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases,\r\nso his claim fails even under Solem\r\n                     *     *    *\r\n  Both the Court and the concurrence claim their deci\r\nsions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line\r\n28                      GRAHAM v. FLORIDA\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndrawing problems to which courts must seek answers\r\nbeyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds\r\nthat “[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual free\r\ndom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide\r\ncrime,” but must provide the offender with “some mean\r\ningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon\r\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Ante, at 24. But\r\nwhat, exactly, does such a “meaningful” opportunity en\r\ntail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment\r\nprinciples will govern review by the parole boards the\r\nCourt now demands that States empanel? The Court\r\nprovides no answers to these questions, which will no\r\ndoubt embroil the courts for years.13\r\n                              V\r\n  The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life\r\nwithout-parole sentence ‘fits’ the crime at issue here or the\r\ncrimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more generally,\r\nbut to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The\r\nFlorida Legislature has concluded that such sentences\r\nshould be available for persons under 18 who commit\r\ncertain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to\r\nimpose that legislatively authorized sentence here. Be\r\ncause a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a “cruel\r\nand unusual” method of punishment under any standard,\r\n——————\r\n   13 It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit\r\n\r\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\r\npermits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of impris\r\nonment for up to 40 years. Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–1.3–401(4)(b) (2009).\r\nIn light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently\r\npermits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offend\r\ners, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence\r\nof agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole\r\nhearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\r\n6–7 (counsel for Graham, stating that, “[o]ur position is that it should\r\nbe left up to the States to decide. We think that the . . . Colorado\r\nprovision would probably be constitutional”).\r\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The fact that the\r\nCourt categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences\r\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an over\r\nwhelming legislative majority in favor of leaving that sen\r\ntencing option available under certain cases simply illus\r\ntrates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional\r\nprinciple the Court has reached to ensure that its own\r\nsense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of\r\nthe people and their representatives.\r\n  I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that “[w]e learn, some\r\ntimes, from our mistakes.” Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).\r\nPerhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.\r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

I write separately to make two points.\r\n   First, the Court holds only that “for a juvenile offender\r\nwho did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment\r\nforbids the sentence of life without parole.” Ante, at 24\r\n(emphasis added). Nothing in the Court’s opinion affects\r\nthe imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the\r\npossibility of parole. Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral\r\nargument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without\r\nthe possibility of parole “probably” would be constitu\r\ntional. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7; see also ante, at 28, n. 12\r\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\r\n   Second, the question whether petitioner’s sentence\r\nviolates the narrow, as-applied proportionality principle\r\nthat applies to noncapital sentences is not properly before\r\nus in this case. Although petitioner asserted an as-applied\r\nproportionality challenge to his sentence before the Flor\r\nida courts, see 982 So. 2d 43, 51–53 (Fla. App. 2008), he\r\ndid not include an as-applied claim in his petition for\r\ncertiorari or in his merits briefs before this Court. In\r\nstead, petitioner argued for only a categorical rule banning\r\nthe imposition of life without parole on any juvenile con\r\nvicted of a nonhomicide offense. Because petitioner aban\r\ndoned his as-applied claim, I would not reach that issue.\r\n2                  GRAHAM v.
