MARTINEZ ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131371. Argued April 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the\n  University of California public-school system, extends official recog\n  nition to student groups through its \u201cRegistered Student Organiza\n  tion\u201d (RSO) program. Several benefits attend this school-approved\n  status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of\n  communication, as well as Hastings\u2019 name and logo. In exchange for\n  recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Critical here, all\n  RSOs must comply with the school\u2019s Nondiscrimination Policy, which\n  tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, includ\n  ing religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as\n  it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers:\n  RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or\n  seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.\n     At the beginning of the 2004\u20132005 academic year, the leaders of an\n  existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society\n  (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that char\n  ters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. These\n  chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and of\n  ficers to sign a \u201cStatement of Faith\u201d and to conduct their lives in ac\n  cord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that\n  sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man\n  and a woman. CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation\n  anyone who engages in \u201cunrepentant homosexual conduct\u201d or holds\n  religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.\n2       CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n            HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    Hastings rejected CLS\u2019s application for RSO status on the ground\n    that the group\u2019s bylaws did not comply with Hastings\u2019 open-access\n    policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual\n    orientation.\n       CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42\n    U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that Hastings\u2019 refusal to grant the group\n    RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to\n    free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion. On\n    cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for\n    Hastings. The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a\n    limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and\n    therefore did not violate CLS\u2019s right to free speech. Nor, in the\n    court\u2019s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS\u2019s right to ex\n    pressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any stu\n    dent, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed\n    conditions on the use of school facilities and funds. The court also re\n    jected CLS\u2019s free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimina\n    tion Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral\n    and of general applicability. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that\n    the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and\n    viewpoint neutral.\nHeld:\n     1. The Court considers only whether a public institution\u2019s condi\n tioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an\n all-comers policy violates the Constitution. CLS urges the Court to\n review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as written\u2014prohibiting\n discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual\n orientation. The policy\u2019s written terms, CLS contends, target solely\n those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove\n of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to\n limit membership to persons committed to the group\u2019s ideology. This\n argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties\n submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: \u201cHast\n ings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, . . . re\n gardless of [her] status or beliefs. For example, the Hastings Democ\n ratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs\n . . . .\u201d This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and\n cannot contradict, their stipulations. See, e.g., Board of Regents of\n Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 226. The Court\n therefore rejects CLS\u2019s attempt to escape from the stipulation and\n shift its target to Hastings\u2019 policy as written. Pp. 8\u201312.\n     2. The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condi\n tion on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress\n First Amendment limitations. Pp. 12\u201331.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (a) The Court\u2019s limited public forum decisions supply the appro\npriate framework for assessing both CLS\u2019s free-speech and expres\nsive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmen\ntal entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose\nrestrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of\nthe forum and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visi\ntors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829. CLS urges the Court to apply\nto its expressive-association claim a different line of cases\u2014decisions\nin which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associa\ntional freedom in the context of public accommodations, e.g., Roberts\nv. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623. But, because CLS\u2019s ex\npressive-association and free-speech arguments merge\u2014who speaks\non its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyed\u2014it makes\nlittle sense to treat the claims as discrete. Instead, three observa\ntions lead the Court to analyze CLS\u2019s arguments under limited\npublic-forum precedents.\n   First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a\nless restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as\ncompared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive\nassociation occurring in a limited public forum. Speech and expres\nsive-association rights are closely linked. See id., at 622. When\nthese intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would\nbe anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review\nunder the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an im\npermissible infringement of expressive association. Second, the strict\nscrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden\nexpressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining\ncharacteristic of limited public forums\u2014the State\u2019s authority to \u201cre\nserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\u201d Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829.\nThird, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum\ncategory, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes\nthe benefits of official recognition. The Court\u2019s expressive-association\ndecisions, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to\ninclude unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, e.g., Boy\nScouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648. Application of the less\nrestrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact\nthat Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of\nsubsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition. Pp. 12\u201317.\n      (b) In three cases, this Court held that public universities had\nunconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treat\nment because of their points of view. See Healy v. James, 408 U. S.\n169; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263; and Rosenberger. Most re\ncently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, the Court held that a\nuniversity generally may not withhold benefits from student groups\n4       CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n            HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    because of their religious outlook. \u201cOnce it has opened a limited\n    [public] forum,\u201d the Court emphasized, \u201cthe State must respect the\n    lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d 515 U. S, at 829. It may \u201cnot ex\n    clude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the\n    purpose served by the forum, . . . nor may it discriminate against\n    speech on the basis of . . . viewpoint.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 17\u201319.\n         (c) Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account\n    the RSO forum\u2019s function and \u201call the surrounding circumstances.\u201d\n    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,\n    809. Pp. 19\u201328.\n            (1) The Court\u2019s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in\n    which it arises: \u201cFirst Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of\n    the special characteristics of the school environment.\u201d Widmar, 454\n    U. S., at 268, n. 5. This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public\n    university has exceeded constitutional constraints. The Court has,\n    however, cautioned courts to resist \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions\n    of sound educational policy for those of . . . school authorities,\u201d for\n    judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school ad\n    ministrators. Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist.,\n    Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206. Because schools enjoy\n    \u201ca significant measure of authority over the type of officially recog\n    nized activities in which their students participate,\u201d Board of Ed. of\n    Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226,\n    240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings\u2019 deci\n    sions about the character of its student-group program are due de\n    cent respect. Pp. 19\u201321.\n            (2) The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all\n    comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forum\u2019s purposes.\n    First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social\n    opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students. RSOs\n    are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student\n    activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to\n    fund a group that would reject her as a member. Second, the policy\n    helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Pol\n    icy without inquiring into an RSO\u2019s motivation for membership re\n    strictions. CLS\u2019s proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of\n    belief but forbid discrimination due to status would impose on Hast\n    ings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student or\n    ganization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.\n    Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the\n    extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and\n    beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among stu\n    dents. Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination pro\n    scriptions, thereby conveying Hastings\u2019 decision to decline to subsi\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndize conduct disapproved by the State. So long as a public school\ndoes not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state\nlaw goals stands on firm footing. Pp. 21\u201324.\n        (3) Hastings\u2019 policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the\n\u201csubstantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student]\ncommunication to take place.\u201d Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educa\ntors\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 53. Hastings offered CLS access to school\nfacilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain\nbulletin boards to advertise events. Although CLS could not take ad\nvantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of\nelectronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance\nof those channels. Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities,\ncommonly maintain a presence at universities without official school\naffiliation. CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activi\nties the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of\nstudents attending those meetings and events doubled. \u201cThe variety\nand type of alternative modes of access present here,\u201d in short, \u201ccom\npare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where\n[the Court has] upheld restrictions.\u201d Id., at 53\u201354. Pp. 24\u201325.\n        (4) CLS\u2019s arguments that the all-comers policy is not reason\nable are unavailing. CLS contends that there can be no diversity of\nviewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around\nviewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS\u2019s preferred policy with\nconstitutional limitation\u2014the advisability of Hastings\u2019 policy does\nnot control its permissibility. A State\u2019s restriction on access to a lim\nited public forum, moreover, \u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the\nonly reasonable limitation.\u201d Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808. CLS\u2019s con\ntention that Hastings\u2019 policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs\nby student saboteurs bent on subverting a group\u2019s mission is more\nhypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO\nhijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley,\n524 U. S. 569, 584. Finally, CLS\u2019s assertion that Hastings lacks any\nlegitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co\nreligionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo,\nwhile ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out. Hastings,\ncaught in the crossfire between a group\u2019s desire to exclude and stu\ndents\u2019 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the\nsand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no\ngroup to discriminate in membership. Pp. 25\u201328.\n     (d) Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral. Pp. 28\u201331.\n        (1) The policy draws no distinction between groups based on\ntheir message or perspective; its requirement that all student groups\naccept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral. Pp. 28\u201329.\n        (2) Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts\n6       CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n            HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    that it systematically\u2014and impermissibly\u2014burdens most heavily\n    those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus\n    mainstream. This argument fails because \u201c[a] regulation that serves\n    purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,\n    even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but\n    not others.\u201d Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791. Hast\n    ings\u2019 requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied,\n    is \u201cjustified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the\n    regulated speech.\u201d Id., at 791. It targets the act of rejecting would-be\n    group members without reference to the reasons motivating that be\n    havior. Pp. 29\u201331.\n      3. Neither lower court addressed CLS\u2019s argument that Hastings se\n    lectively enforces its all-comers policy. This Court is not the proper\n    forum to air the issue in the first instance.

LEO P. MARTINEZ ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 28, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In a series of decisions, this Court has emphasized that\nthe First Amendment generally precludes public universi\u00ad\nties from denying student organizations access to school\u00ad\nsponsored forums because of the groups\u2019 viewpoints. See\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981);\nHealy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972). This case concerns a\nnovel question regarding student activities at public uni\u00ad\nversities: May a public law school condition its official\nrecognition of a student group\u2014and the attendant use of\nschool funds and facilities\u2014on the organization\u2019s agree\u00ad\nment to open eligibility for membership and leadership to\nall students?\n   In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS),\nan accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment\nrights to free speech, expressive association, and free\nexercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquish\u00ad\ning the advantages of recognition, to accept members who\n2    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndo not share the organization\u2019s core beliefs about religion\nand sexual orientation. From the perspective of respon\u00ad\ndent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law\nSchool), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across\u00ad\nthe-board open-access requirement designed to further the\nreasonable educational purposes underpinning the school\u2019s\nstudent-organization program.\n  In accord with the District Court and the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals, we reject CLS\u2019s First Amendment challenge. Com\u00ad\npliance with Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy, we conclude, is a\nreasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the\nstudent-organization forum. In requiring CLS\u2014in com\u00ad\nmon with all other student organizations\u2014to choose be\u00ad\ntween welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of\nofficial recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress\nconstitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks\nnot parity with other organizations, but a preferential\nexemption from Hastings\u2019 policy. The First Amendment\nshields CLS against state prohibition of the organization\u2019s\nexpressive activity, however exclusionary that activity\nmay be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state\nsubvention of its selectivity.\n                               I\n  Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in\nthe University of California public-school system. Like\nmany institutions of higher education, Hastings encour\u00ad\nages students to form extracurricular associations that\n\u201ccontribute to the Hastings community and experience.\u201d\nApp. 349.

Id., at 227\u2013228. Several days later, the Law\nSchool rejected the application; CLS\u2019s bylaws, Hastings\nexplained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy because CLS barred students based on religion and\nsexual orientation. Id., at 228.\n   CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondis\u00ad\ncrimination Policy, id., at 281, but Hastings declined to\ngrant one. \u201c[T]o be one of our student-recognized organi\u00ad\nzations,\u201d Hastings reiterated, \u201cCLS must open its mem\u00ad\nbership to all students irrespective of their religious be\u00ad\nliefs or sexual orientation.\u201d Id., at 294. If CLS instead\nchose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings\nstated, the school \u201cwould be pleased to provide [CLS] the\nuse of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\u201d\nIbid. CLS would also have access to chalkboards and\ngenerally available campus bulletin boards to announce its\nevents. Id., at 219, 233. In other words, Hastings would\ndo nothing to suppress CLS\u2019s endeavors, but neither would\nit lend RSO-level support for them.\n   Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not obtain RSO\nstatus. It did, however, operate independently during the\n2004\u20132005 academic year. CLS held weekly Bible-study\nmeetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday\nand Easter Sunday church services.

In a hearing before the District Court, CLS\u2019s counsel reiterated\nthat \u201cit\u2019s important to understand what Hastings\u2019 policy is.

And at oral argument in this Court, counsel for CLS ac\u00ad\nknowledged that \u201cthe Court needs to reach the constitutionality of the\nall-comers policy as applied to CLS in this case.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 59\n(emphasis added). We repeat, in this regard, that Hastings\u2019 all-comers\npolicy is hardly novel. Other law schools have adopted similar re\u00ad\nquirements.

In context, Hastings\u2019 answer\u2014which\nresponded to CLS\u2019s allegation that the Law School singles out religious\ngroups for discriminatory treatment\u2014is sensibly read to convey that\nHastings\u2019 policies and regulations apply to all groups equally. See App.\n79 (denying that the Nondiscrimination Policy imposes on religious\norganizations restraints that are not applied to political, social, and\ncultural groups). In any event, the parties\u2019 joint stipulation supersedes\nthe answer, to the extent of any conflict between the two filings. See\nPepper & Tanner, Inc. v.

S., at 829. See also, e.g., Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107\n(2001); Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free\nSchool Dist., 508 U.

S. 37, 46\n(1983).12\n   Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this\nCourt has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that\nconstrain associational freedom. In the context of public\naccommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that\nfreedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted\nonly if they serve \u201ccompelling state interests\u201d that are\n\u201cunrelated to the suppression of ideas\u201d\u2014interests that\ncannot be advanced \u201cthrough . . . significantly less restric\u00ad\ntive [means].\u201d Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S.\n609, 623 (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v.\nDale, 530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). \u201cFreedom of association,\u201d\nwe have recognized, \u201cplainly presupposes a freedom not to\nassociate.\u201d Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an\norganization embrace unwelcome members, we have\ntherefore concluded, \u201cdirectly and immediately affects\nassociational rights.\u201d Dale, 530 U. S., at 659.\n   CLS would have us engage each line of cases independ\u00ad\nently, but its expressive-association and free-speech ar\u00ad\nguments merge: Who speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons,\ncolors what concept is conveyed. See Brief for Petitioner\n35 (expressive association in this case is \u201cthe functional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Our decisions make clear, and the parties agree, that Hastings,\n\nthrough its RSO program, established a limited public forum. See\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829\n(1995); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (counsel for CLS); Brief for Petitioner 25\u201326;\nBrief for Hastings 27\u201328; Brief for Hastings Outlaw 27.\n14   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nequivalent of speech itself\u201d). It therefore makes little\nsense to treat CLS\u2019s speech and association claims as\ndiscrete. See Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for\nFair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 300 (1981). In\u00ad\nstead, three observations lead us to conclude that our\nlimited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate\nframework for assessing both CLS\u2019s speech and associa\u00ad\ntion rights.\n    First, the same considerations that have led us to apply\na less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited\npublic forums as compared to other environments, see\nsupra, at 12\u201313, and n. 11, apply with equal force to ex\u00ad\npressive association occurring in limited public forums. As\njust noted, speech and expressive-association rights are\nclosely linked. See Roberts, 468 U. S., at 622 (Associa\u00ad\ntional freedom is \u201cimplicit in the right to engage in activi\u00ad\nties protected by the First Amendment.\u201d). When these\nintertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it\nwould be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive\nconstitutional review under our limited-public-forum test\nonly to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of\nexpressive association. Accord Brief for State Universities\nand State University Systems as Amici Curiae 37\u201338.\nThat result would be all the more anomalous in this case,\nfor CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim\nplays a part auxiliary to speech\u2019s starring role. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 18.\n    Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have\napplied in some settings to laws that burden expressive\nassociation would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining\ncharacteristic of limited public forums\u2014the State may\n\u201creserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829. See also Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 49\n(\u201cImplicit in the concept\u201d of a limited public forum is the\nState\u2019s \u201cright to make distinctions in access on the basis of\n. . . speaker identity.\u201d); Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 806 (\u201c[A]\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspeaker may be excluded from\u201d a limited public forum \u201cif\nhe is not a member of the class of speakers for whose\nespecial benefit the forum was created.\u201d).\n   An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools,\nincluding Hastings, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a, ordinar\u00ad\nily, and without controversy, limit official student-group\nrecognition to organizations comprising only students\u2014\neven if those groups wish to associate with nonstudents.\nSee, e.g., Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and\nGovernment Subsidies, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1919, 1940 (2006).\nThe same ground rules must govern both speech and\nassociation challenges in the limited-public-forum context,\nlest strict scrutiny trump a public university\u2019s ability to\n\u201cconfin[e] a [speech] forum to the limited and legitimate\npurposes for which it was created.\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829. See also Healy, 408 U. S., at 189 (\u201cAssocia\u00ad\ntional activities need not be tolerated where they infringe\nreasonable campus rules.\u201d).\n   Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited\u00ad\npublic-forum category, for CLS, in seeking what is effec\u00ad\ntively a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure to mod\u00ad\nify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person\nfor any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recogni\u00ad\ntion.13 The expressive-association precedents on which\nCLS relies, in contrast, involved regulations that com\npelled a group to include unwanted members, with no\nchoice to opt out. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U. S., at 648 (regula\u00ad\ntion \u201cforc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did]\nnot desire\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Roberts,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The fact that a university \u201cexpends funds to encourage a diversity\n\nof views from private speakers,\u201d this Court has held, does not justify it\nin \u201cdiscriminat[ing] based on the viewpoint of private persons whose\nspeech it facilitates.\u201d Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 834. Applying limited\u00ad\npublic-forum analysis (which itself prohibits viewpoint discrimination)\nto CLS\u2019s expressive association claim, we emphasize, does not upset\nthis principle.\n16    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n468 U. S., at 623 (\u201cThere can be no clearer example of\nan intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of\nan association than\u201d forced inclusion of unwelcome\nparticipants.). 14\n  In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished\nbetween policies that require action and those that with\u00ad\nhold benefits. See, e.g., Grove City College v. Bell, 465\nU. S. 555, 575\u2013576 (1984); Bob Jones Univ. v. United\nStates, 461 U. S. 574, 602\u2013604 (1983). Application of the\nless-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better ac\u00ad\ncounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO pro\u00ad\ngram, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the\nstick of prohibition. Cf. Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S.\n455, 463 (1973) (\u201cThat the Constitution may compel tol\u00ad\neration of private discrimination in some circumstances\ndoes not mean that it requires state support for such\ndiscrimination.\u201d).\n  In sum, we are persuaded that our limited-public-forum\nprecedents adequately respect both CLS\u2019s speech and\nexpressive-association rights, and fairly balance those\nrights against Hastings\u2019 interests as property owner and\neducational institution. We turn to the merits of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 CLS also brackets with expressive-association precedents our deci\u00ad\n\nsion in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of\nBoston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995). There, a veterans group sponsoring\na St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade challenged a state law requiring it to allow\ngay individuals to march in the parade behind a banner celebrating\ntheir Irish heritage and sexual orientation. Id., at 572. In evaluating\nthat challenge, the Hurley Court focused on the veterans group\u2019s\ninterest in controlling the message conveyed by the organization. See\nid., at 573\u2013581. Whether Hurley is best conceptualized as a speech or\nassociation case (or both), however, that precedent is of little help to\nCLS.      Hurley involved the application of a statewide public\u00ad\naccommodations law to the most traditional of public forums: the\nstreet. That context differs markedly from the limited public forum at\nissue here: a university\u2019s application of an all-comers policy to its\nstudent-organization program.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninstant dispute, therefore, with the limited-public-forum\ndecisions as our guide.\n                             B\n   As earlier pointed out, supra, at 1, 12\u201313, we do not\nwrite on a blank slate; we have three times before consid\u00ad\nered clashes between public universities and student\ngroups seeking official recognition or its attendant bene\u00ad\nfits. First, in Healy, a state college denied school affilia\u00ad\ntion to a student group that wished to form a local chapter\nof Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). 408 U. S., at\n170. Characterizing SDS\u2019s mission as violent and disrup\u00ad\ntive, and finding the organization\u2019s philosophy repugnant,\nthe college completely banned the SDS chapter from cam\u00ad\npus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication\nbetween students and the group, university officials went\nso far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a cam\u00ad\npus coffee shop. Id., at 174\u2013176. The college, we noted,\ncould require \u201cthat a group seeking official recognition\naffirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable\ncampus law,\u201d including \u201creasonable standards respecting\nconduct.\u201d Id., at 193. But a public educational institution\nexceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it \u201crestrict[s]\nspeech or association simply because it finds the views\nexpressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.\u201d Id., at 187\u2013188.15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The dissent relies heavily on Healy, post, at 13\u201317, but its other\u00ad\n\nwise exhaustive account of the case elides the very fact the Healy Court\nidentified as dispositive: The president of the college explicitly denied\nthe student group official recognition because of the group\u2019s viewpoint.\nSee 408 U. S, at 187 (\u201cThe mere disagreement of the President with the\ngroup\u2019s philosophy affords no reason to deny it recognition.\u201d). In this\ncase, in contrast, Hastings denied CLS recognition not because the\nschool wanted to silence the \u201cviewpoint that CLS sought to express\nthrough its membership requirements,\u201d post, at 17, n. 2, but because\nCLS, insisting on preferential treatment, declined to comply with the\nopen-access policy applicable to all RSOs, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505\nU. S. 377, 390 (1992) (\u201cWhere the [State] does not target conduct on the\n18    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n   We later relied on Healy in Widmar. In that case, a\npublic university, in an effort to avoid state support for\nreligion, had closed its facilities to a registered student\ngroup that sought to use university space for religious\nworship and discussion. 454 U. S., at 264\u2013265. \u201cA univer\u00ad\nsity\u2019s mission is education,\u201d we observed, \u201cand decisions of\nthis Court have never denied a university\u2019s authority to\nimpose reasonable regulations compatible with that mis\u00ad\nsion upon the use of its campus and facilities.\u201d Id., at 268,\nn. 5. But because the university singled out religious\norganizations for disadvantageous treatment, we sub\u00ad\njected the university\u2019s regulation to strict scrutiny. Id., at\n269\u2013270. The school\u2019s interest \u201cin maintaining strict\nseparation of church and State,\u201d we held, was not \u201csuffi\u00ad\nciently compelling to justify . . . [viewpoint] discrimination\nagainst . . . religious speech.\u201d Id., at 270, 276 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, we\nreiterated that a university generally may not withhold\nbenefits from student groups because of their religious\noutlook. The officially recognized student group in Rosen\nberger was denied student-activity-fee funding to distrib\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbasis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regulation\nmerely because they express a discriminatory . . . philosophy.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). As discussed infra, at 28\u201331, Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is\nparadigmatically viewpoint neutral. The dissent\u2019s contention that \u201cthe\nidentity of the student group\u201d is the only \u201cway of distinguishing Healy,\u201d\npost, at 16, is thus untenable.\n   The dissent\u2019s description of Healy also omits the Healy Court\u2019s\nobservation that \u201c[a] college administration may . . . requir[e] . . . that a\ngroup seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to\nadhere to reasonable campus law. Such a requirement does not impose\nan impermissible condition on the students\u2019 associational rights. . . . It\nmerely constitutes an agreement to conform with reasonable standards\nrespecting conduct. . . . [T]he benefits of participation in the internal\nlife of the college community may be denied to any group that reserves\nthe right to violate any valid campus rules with which it disagrees.\u201d\n408 U.

By\n\u201cselect[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journal\u00ad\nistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\u201d we held,\nthe university had engaged in \u201cviewpoint discrimination,\nwhich is presumed impermissible when directed against\nspeech otherwise within the forum\u2019s limitations.\u201d Id., at\n831, 830.\n   In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had\nbeen unconstitutionally singled out because of their points\nof view. \u201cOnce it has opened a limited [public] forum,\u201d we\nemphasized, \u201cthe State must respect the lawful bounda\u00ad\nries it has itself set.\u201d Id., at 829.

See post, at 1, 15\u201316, 27. As noted supra, at 19\u201320, this\nCourt, exercising its independent judgment, must \u201cinterpre[t] and\nappl[y] . . . the right to free speech.\u201d Post, at 16. But determinations of\nwhat constitutes sound educational policy or what goals a student\u00ad\norganization forum ought to serve fall within the discretion of school\nadministrators and educators. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Hendrick\nHudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176,\n206 (1982).\n   17 Although the dissent maintains it is \u201ccontent to address the consti\u00ad\n\ntutionality of Hastings\u2019 actions under our limited public forum cases,\u201d\npost, at 17, it resists the import of those cases at every turn. For\nexample, although the dissent acknowledges that a university has the\nauthority to set the boundaries of a limited public forum, post, at 17, 24,\nthe dissent refuses to credit Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy as one of those\nboundaries. See ibid. (insisting that \u201cHastings\u2019 regulations . . . impose\nonly two substantive limitations: A group . . . must have student\nmembers and must be non-commercial.\u201d). In short, \u201cthe design of the\nRSO forum,\u201d post, at 26, which the dissent discusses at length, post, at\n24\u201331, is of its own tailoring.\n   Another example: The dissent pointedly observes that \u201c[w]hile there\ncan be no question that the State of California could not impose [an all\u00ad\ncomers] restrictio[n] on all religious groups in the State, the Court now\nholds that Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same\nrequirements on students who wish to participate in a forum that is\ndesigned to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.\u201d Post, at 27. As\nnoted supra, at 12\u201313, and n. 11, this difference reflects the lesser\nstandard of scrutiny applicable to limited public forums compared to\nother forums. The dissent fights the distinction between state prohibi\ntion and state support, but its real quarrel is with our limited public\nforum doctrine, which recognizes that distinction. CLS, it bears repeti\u00ad\ntion, remains free to express whatever it will, but it cannot insist on an\nexemption from Hastings\u2019 embracive all-comers policy.\n22    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

RSOs,\nwe count it significant, are eligible for financial assist-\nance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see\nsupra, at 3; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings\nstudent is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a\nmember.18\n  Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings\npolice the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy\nwithout inquiring into an RSO\u2019s motivation for member\u00ad\nship restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS\u2019s\nview of the Constitution\u2019s limits, CLS proposes that Hast\u00ad\nings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimi\u00ad\nnation due to status. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But that\nproposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor.\nHow should the Law School go about determining whether\na student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion\nin belief-based garb? If a hypothetical Male-Superiority\nClub barred a female student from running for its presi\u00ad\ndency, for example, how could the Law School tell whether\nthe group rejected her bid because of her sex or because,\nby seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief\nin its fundamental philosophy?\n  This case itself is instructive in this regard. CLS con\u00ad\ntends that it does not exclude individuals because of sex\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 CLS notes that its \u201cactivities\u2014its Bible studies, speakers, and din\u00ad\n\nners\u2014are open to all students,\u201d even if attendees are barred from\nmembership and leadership. Reply Brief 20. Welcoming all comers as\nguests or auditors, however, is hardly equivalent to accepting all\ncomers as full-fledged participants.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Our deci\u00ad\nsions have declined to distinguish between status and\nconduct in this context. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S.\n558, 575 (2003) (\u201cWhen homosexual conduct is made\ncriminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of\nitself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to\ndiscrimination.\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 583 (O\u2019Connor,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (\u201cWhile it is true that the law\napplies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is\nconduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual.\nUnder such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at more\nthan conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as\na class.\u201d); cf. Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic,\n506 U. S. 263, 270 (1993) (\u201cA tax on wearing yarmulkes is\na tax on Jews.\u201d). See also Brief for Lambda Legal Defense\nand Education Fund, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 7\u201320.\n   Third, the Law School reasonably adheres to the view\nthat an all-comers policy, to the extent it brings together\nindividuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, \u201cencour\u00ad\nages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among stu\u00ad\ndents.\u201d App. 349.19 And if the policy sometimes produces\ndiscord, Hastings can rationally rank among RSO\u00ad\nprogram goals development of conflict-resolution skills,\ntoleration, and readiness to find common ground.\n   Fourth, Hastings\u2019 policy, which incorporates\u2014in fact,\nsubsumes\u2014state-law proscriptions on discrimination,\nconveys the Law School\u2019s decision \u201cto decline to subsidize\nwith public monies and benefits conduct of which the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 CLS\u2019s predecessor organization, the Hastings Christian Fellowship\n\n(HCF), experienced these benefits first-hand when it welcomed an\nopenly gay student as a member during the 2003\u20132004 academic year.\nThat student, testified another HCF member, \u201cwas a joy to have\u201d in the\ngroup and brought a unique perspective to Bible-study discussions. See\nApp. 325, 327.\n24    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\npeople of California disapprove.\u201d Brief for Hastings 35;\nid., at 33\u201334 (citing Cal. Educ. Code \u00a766270 (prohibiting\ndiscrimination on various bases)). State law, of course,\nmay not command that public universities take action\nimpermissible under the First Amendment. But so long as\na public university does not contravene constitutional\nlimits, its choice to advance state-law goals through the\nschool\u2019s educational endeavors stands on firm footing.\n  In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in\nsupport of its all-comers requirement are surely reason\u00ad\nable in light of the RSO forum\u2019s purposes.20\n                               3\n   The Law School\u2019s policy is all the more creditworthy in\nview of the \u201csubstantial alternative channels that remain\nopen for [CLS-student] communication to take place.\u201d\nPerry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 53. If restrictions on access\nto a limited public forum are viewpoint discriminatory, the\nability of a group to exist outside the forum would not cure\nthe constitutional shortcoming. But when access barriers\nare viewpoint neutral, our decisions have counted it sig\u00ad\nnificant that other available avenues for the group to\nexercise its First Amendment rights lessen the burden\ncreated by those barriers. See ibid.; Cornelius, 473 U. S.,\nat 809; Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828, 839 (1976); Pell, 417\nU. S., at 827\u2013828.\n   In this case, Hastings offered CLS access to school facili\u00ad\nties to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and\ngenerally available bulletin boards to advertise events.\nApp. 232\u2013233. Although CLS could not take advantage of\nRSO-specific methods of communication, see supra, at 3,\nthe advent of electronic media and social-networking sites\nreduces the importance of those channels. See App. 114\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 Although the Law School has offered multiple justifications for its\n\nall-comers policy, we do not suggest that each of them is necessary for\nthe policy to survive constitutional review.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

It is beyond dissenter\u2019s license, we note again, see\nsupra, at 21, n. 17, constantly to maintain that nonrecog\u00ad\nnition of a student organization is equivalent to prohibit\u00ad\ning its members from speaking.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 See,  e.g., Baker, Despite Lack of University Recognition, Pi Kappa\nTheta Continues to Grow, The New Hampshire, Sept. 28, 2009, pp. 1, 5\n(unrecognized fraternity able to grow despite severed ties with the\nUniversity of New Hampshire); Battey, Final Clubs Provide Controver\u00ad\nsial Social Outlet, Yale Daily News, Apr. 5, 2006, pp. 1, 4 (Harvard\nsocial clubs, known as \u201cfinal clubs,\u201d \u201cplay a large role in the experience\nof . . . students\u201d even though \u201cthey became completely disassociated\nfrom the university in 1984\u201d).\n26    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n                                   4\n    CLS nevertheless deems Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy\n\u201cfrankly absurd.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 49. \u201cThere can be no\ndiversity of viewpoints in a forum,\u201d it asserts, \u201cif groups\nare not permitted to form around viewpoints.\u201d Id., at 50;\naccord post, at 25 (ALITO, J., dissenting). This catchphrase\nconfuses CLS\u2019s preferred policy with constitutional limita\u00ad\ntion\u2014the advisability of Hastings\u2019 policy does not control\nits permissibility. See Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,\n326 (1975). Instead, we have repeatedly stressed that a\nState\u2019s restriction on access to a limited public forum\n\u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable\nlimitation.\u201d Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808.22\n    CLS also assails the reasonableness of the all-comers\npolicy in light of the RSO forum\u2019s function by forecasting\nthat the policy will facilitate hostile takeovers; if organiza\u00ad\ntions must open their arms to all, CLS contends, saboteurs\nwill infiltrate groups to subvert their mission and mes\u00ad\nsage. This supposition strikes us as more hypothetical\nthan real. CLS points to no history or prospect of RSO\u00ad\nhijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts\nv. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 584 (1998) (\u201c[W]e are reluctant\n. . . to invalidate legislation on the basis of its hypothetical\napplication to situations not before the Court.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).

In the 2004\u20132005 academic year, approximately\n60 student organizations, representing a variety of interests, registered\nwith Hastings, from the Clara Foltz Feminist Association, to the\nEnvironmental Law Society, to the Hastings Chinese Law and Culture\nSociety. App. 215, 237\u2013238. Three of these 60 registered groups had a\nreligious orientation: Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students,\nHastings Jewish Law Students Association, and Hastings Koinonia.\nId., at 215\u2013216.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

And if a rogue\nstudent intent on sabotaging an organization\u2019s objectives\nnevertheless attempted a takeover, the members of that\ngroup would not likely elect her as an officer.\n   RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy,\nmay condition eligibility for membership and leadership\non attendance, the payment of dues, or other neutral\nrequirements designed to ensure that students join be\u00ad\ncause of their commitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its\ndemise. See supra, at 4, n. 2. Several RSOs at Hastings\nlimit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this\nway. See, e.g., App. 192 (members must \u201c[p]ay their dues\non a timely basis\u201d and \u201cattend meetings regularly\u201d); id., at\n173 (members must complete an application and pay dues;\n\u201c[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly\nscheduled meetings shall be dropped from rolls\u201d); App. to\nPet. for Cert. 129a (\u201cOnly Hastings students who have\nheld membership in this organization for a minimum of\none semester shall be eligible to be an officer.\u201d).23\n   Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more\nfrom its law students than the disruptive behavior CLS\nhypothesizes\u2014and to build this expectation into its educa\u00ad\ntional approach. A reasonable policy need not anticipate\nand preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance\nor manipulation. If students begin to exploit an all-comers\npolicy by hijacking organizations to distort or destroy their\nmissions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise\nits policy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for Hastings);\nBrief for Hastings 38.\n   Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats, post, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 As Hastings notes, other \u201cchecks [are also] in place\u201d to prevent\n\nRSO-sabotage.

CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n29) that the Law School lacks any legitimate interest\u2014let\nalone one reasonably related to the RSO forum\u2019s pur\u00ad\nposes\u2014in urging \u201creligious groups not to favor co\u00ad\nreligionists for purposes of their religious activities.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 43; id., at 50. CLS\u2019s analytical error lies in\nfocusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignoring the\ninterests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all,\nhas two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a\ngroup\u2019s desire to exclude and students\u2019 demand for equal\naccess, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting\nall organizations to express what they wish but no group\nto discriminate in membership.24\n                          D\n  We next consider whether Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is\nviewpoint neutral.\n                             1\n  Although this aspect of limited-public-forum analysis\nhas been the constitutional sticking point in our prior\ndecisions, as earlier recounted, supra, at 17\u201319, we need\nnot dwell on it here. It is, after all, hard to imagine a\nmore viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring all\nstudent groups to accept all comers. In contrast to Healy,\nWidmar, and Rosenberger, in which universities singled\nout organizations for disfavored treatment because of their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 In arguing that the all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of\n\nthe RSO forum\u2019s purposes, the dissent notes that Title VII, which\nprohibits employment discrimination on the basis of religion, among\nother categories, provides an exception for religious associations. Post,\nat 28, n. 8. The question here, however, is not whether Hastings could,\nconsistent with the Constitution, provide religious groups dispensation\nfrom the all-comers policy by permitting them to restrict membership to\nthose who share their faith. It is instead whether Hastings must grant\nthat exemption. This Court\u2019s decision in Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 878\u2013882 (1990),\nunequivocally answers no to that latter question. See also infra, at 31,\nn. 27.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

An all-comers condition on access to RSO\nstatus, in short, is textbook viewpoint neutral.25\n                             2\n   Conceding that Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is \u201cnominally\nneutral,\u201d CLS attacks the regulation by pointing to its\neffect: The policy is vulnerable to constitutional assault,\nCLS contends, because \u201cit systematically and predictably\nburdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are\nout of favor with the campus mainstream.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 51; cf. post, at 1 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (charging\nthat Hastings\u2019 policy favors \u201cpolitical[ly] correc[t]\u201d student\nexpression). This argument stumbles from its first step\nbecause \u201c[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to\nthe content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has\nan incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 Relying  exclusively on Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v.\nSouthworth, 529 U. S. 217 (2000), the dissent \u201cwould not be so quick to\njump to th[e] conclusion\u201d that the all-comers policy is viewpoint neu\u00ad\ntral. Post, at 31, and 31\u201332, n. 10. Careful consideration of South\nworth, however, reveals how desperate the dissent\u2019s argument is. In\nSouthworth, university students challenged a mandatory student\u00ad\nactivity fee used to fund student groups. Finding the political and\nideological speech of certain groups offensive, the student-challengers\nargued that imposition of the fee violated their First Amendment\nrights. 529 U. S., at 221. This Court upheld the university\u2019s choice to\nsubsidize groups whose expression some students found distasteful, but\nwe admonished that the university could not \u201cprefer some viewpoints to\nothers\u201d in the distribution of funds. Id., at 233. We cautioned that the\nuniversity\u2019s referendum process, which allowed students to vote on\nwhether a student organization would receive financial support, risked\nviolation of this principle by allowing students to select groups to fund\nbased on their viewpoints. Id., at 235. In this case, in contrast, the all\u00ad\ncomers policy governs all RSOs; Hastings does not pick and choose\nwhich organizations must comply with the policy on the basis of view\u00ad\npoint. App. 221. Southworth accordingly provides no support for the\ndissent\u2019s warped analysis.\n30   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

I join its opinion\nwithout reservation. Because the dissent has volunteered\nan argument that the school\u2019s general Nondiscrimination\nPolicy would be \u201cplainly\u201d unconstitutional if applied to this\ncase, post, at 18 (opinion of ALITO, J.), a brief response\nis appropriate. In my view, both policies are plainly\nlegitimate.\n  The Hastings College of Law\u2019s (Hastings) Nondiscrimi\nnation Policy contains boilerplate language used by insti\ntutions and workplaces across the country: It prohibits\n\u201cunlawfu[l]\u201d discrimination \u201con the basis of race, color,\nreligion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or\nsexual orientation.\u201d App. 220. Petitioner, the Hastings\nchapter of the Christian Legal Society (CLS), refused to\ncomply. As the Court explains, ante, at 5\u20136, CLS was\nunwilling to admit members unless they affirmed their\nbelief in certain Christian doctrines and refrained from\n\u201cparticipation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral life\nstyle,\u201d App. 146. CLS, in short, wanted to receive the\nschool\u2019s formal recognition\u2014and the benefits that attend\n2     CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring\n\n\nformal recognition\u2014while continuing to exclude gay and\nnon-Christian students (as well as, it seems, students who\nadvocate for gay rights).\n   In the dissent\u2019s view, by refusing to grant CLS an ex\nemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, Hastings\nviolated CLS\u2019s rights, for by proscribing unlawful dis\ncrimination on the basis of religion, the policy discrimi\nnates unlawfully on the basis of religion. There are nu\nmerous reasons why this counterintuitive theory is\nunsound. Although the First Amendment may protect\nCLS\u2019s discriminatory practices off campus, it does not\nrequire a public university to validate or support them.\n   As written, the Nondiscrimination Policy is content and\nviewpoint neutral. It does not reflect a judgment by school\nofficials about the substance of any student group\u2019s\nspeech. Nor does it exclude any would-be groups on the\nbasis of their convictions. Indeed, it does not regulate\nexpression or belief at all. The policy is \u201cdirected at the\norganization\u2019s activities rather than its philosophy,\u201d Healy\nv. James, 408 U. S. 169, 188 (1972). Those who hold reli\ngious beliefs are not \u201csingled out,\u201d post, at 19 (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting); those who engage in discriminatory conduct\nbased on someone else\u2019s religious status and belief are\nsingled out.1 Regardless of whether they are the product\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent appears to accept that Hastings may prohibit discrimi\n\nnation on the basis of religious status, though it rejects the notion that\nHastings may do the same for religious belief. See, e.g., post, at 22, n. 5,\n28. If CLS sought to exclude a Muslim student in virtue of the fact that\nhe \u201cis\u201d Muslim, the dissent suggests, there would be no problem in\nHastings forbidding that. But if CLS sought to exclude the same\nstudent in virtue of the fact that he subscribes to the Muslim faith,\nHastings must stand idly by. This proposition is not only unworkable\nin practice but also flawed in conception. A person\u2019s religion often\nsimultaneously constitutes or informs a status, an identity, a set of\nbeliefs and practices, and much else besides. (So does sexual orienta\ntion for that matter, see ante, at 22\u201323, notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s\nview that a rule excluding those who engage in \u201cunrepentant homosex\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

There is,\nmoreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because\nof any reason related to the particular views that religious\nindividuals or groups might have, much less because of a\ndesire to suppress or distort those views. The policy\u2019s\nreligion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to un\ndermine, religious freedom.\n   To be sure, the policy may end up having greater conse\nquence for religious groups\u2014whether and to what extent\nit will is far from clear ex ante\u2014inasmuch as they are\nmore likely than their secular counterparts to wish to\nexclude students of particular faiths. But there is likewise\nno evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to\nreligious groups, or that it has in practice caused signifi\ncant harm to their operations. And it is a basic tenet of\nFirst Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in\nitself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.2 The dissent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nual conduct,\u201d App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or\nidentity, post, at 22\u201323.) Our First Amendment doctrine has never\nrequired university administrators to undertake the impossible task of\nseparating out belief-based from status-based religious discrimination.\n   2 See, e.g., Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 763\n\n(1994); R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385 (1992); Board of Directors\nof Rotary Int\u2019l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.

Courts and commen\ntators have applied this insight to the exact situation posed by the\nNondiscrimination Policy. See, e.g., Christian Legal Society v.

MARTINEZ \n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring\n\n\nhas thus given no reason to be skeptical of the basic\ndesign, function, or rationale of the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy.\n  What the policy does reflect is a judgment that dis\ncrimination by school officials or organizations on the\nbasis of certain factors, such as race and religion, is less\ntolerable than discrimination on the basis of other factors.\nThis approach may or may not be the wisest choice in the\ncontext of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) pro\ngram. But it is at least a reasonable choice. Academic\nadministrators routinely employ antidiscrimination rules\nto promote tolerance, understanding, and respect, and to\nsafeguard students from invidious forms of discrimination,\nincluding sexual orientation discrimination.3 Applied to\nthe RSO context, these values can, in turn, advance nu\nmerous pedagogical objectives.         See post, at 3\u20134\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n  It is critical, in evaluating CLS\u2019s challenge to the Non\ndiscrimination Policy, to keep in mind that an RSO pro\ngram is a limited forum\u2014the boundaries of which may be\ndelimited by the proprietor. When a religious association,\nor a secular association, operates in a wholly public set\nting, it must be allowed broad freedom to control its mem\nbership and its message, even if its decisions cause offense\nto outsiders. Profound constitutional problems would\narise if the State of California tried to \u201cdemand that all\nChristian groups admit members who believe that Jesus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 In a case about an antidiscrimination policy that, even if ill-advised,\n\nis explicitly directed at preventing religious discrimination, it is rather\nhard to swallow the dissent\u2019s ominous closing remarks. See post, at 37\n(suggesting that today\u2019s decision \u201cpoint[s] a judicial dagger at the heart\nof\u201d religious groups in the United States (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Although the dissent is willing to see pernicious antireligi\nous motives and implications where there are none, it does not seem\ntroubled by the fact that religious sects, unfortunately, are not the only\nsocial groups who have been persecuted throughout history simply for\nbeing who they are.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Hastings College of Law\nis not a legislature. And no state actor has demanded that\nanyone do anything outside the confines of a discrete,\nvoluntary academic program. Although it may be the case\nthat to some \u201cuniversity students, the campus is their\nworld,\u201d post, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it\ndoes not follow that the campus ought to be equated with\nthe public square.\n   The campus is, in fact, a world apart from the public\nsquare in numerous respects, and religious organizations,\nas well as all other organizations, must abide by certain\nnorms of conduct when they enter an academic commu\nnity. Public universities serve a distinctive role in a mod\nern democratic society. Like all specialized government\nentities, they must make countless decisions about how to\nallocate resources in pursuit of their role. Some of those\ndecisions will be controversial; many will have differential\neffects across populations; virtually all will entail value\njudgments of some kind. As a general matter, courts\nshould respect universities\u2019 judgments and let them man\nage their own affairs.\n   The RSO forum is no different. It is not an open com\nmons that Hastings happens to maintain. It is a mecha\nnism through which Hastings confers certain benefits and\npursues certain aspects of its educational mission. Having\nexercised its discretion to establish an RSO program, a\nuniversity must treat all participants evenhandedly. But\nthe university need not remain neutral\u2014indeed it could\nnot remain neutral\u2014in determining which goals the pro\ngram will serve and which rules are best suited to facili\ntate those goals. These are not legal questions but policy\nquestions; they are not for the Court but for the university\nto make. When any given group refuses to comply with\n6    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

On many levels, a university administra\ntor has a \u201cgreater interest in the content of student activi\nties than the police chief has in the content of a soapbox\noration.\u201d Widmar v.

The expressive associa\ntion argument it presses, however, is hardly limited to\nthese facts. Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews,\nblacks, and women\u2014or those who do not share their con\ntempt for Jews, blacks, and women. A free society must\ntolerate such groups. It need not subsidize them, give\nthem its official imprimatur, or grant them equal access to\nlaw school facilities.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

When the gov\nernment does exclude from a limited forum, however,\nother content-based judgments may be impermissible. For\ninstance, an otherwise qualified and relevant speaker may\nnot be excluded because of hostility to his or her views or\nbeliefs. See Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169, 187\u2013188\n(1972).\n   In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819 (1995), the essential purpose of the limited\nforum was to facilitate the expression of differing views in\nthe context of student publications. The forum was lim\nited because it was confined: first, to student-run groups;\nand second, to publications. The forum was created in the\nlong tradition of using newspapers and other publications\nto express differing views and also in the honored tradi\ntion of a university setting that stimulates the free ex\nchange of ideas. See id., at 835 (\u201c[I]n the University set\nting, . . . the State acts against a background and tradition\n2    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV.

These considera\ntions supported the Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the\nFirst Amendment, a limited forum for student-run publi\ncations did not permit the exclusion of a paper for the\nreason that it was devoted to expressing religious views.\n   Rosenberger is distinguishable from the instant case in\nvarious respects. Not least is that here the school policy in\nquestion is not content based either in its formulation or\nevident purpose; and were it shown to be otherwise, the\ncase likely should have a different outcome. Here, the\npolicy applies equally to all groups and views. And, given\nthe stipulation of the parties, there is no basis for an\nallegation that the design or purpose of the rule was, by\nsubterfuge, to discriminate based on viewpoint.\n   An objection might be that the all-comers policy, even if\nnot so designed or intended, in fact makes it difficult for\ncertain groups to express their views in a manner essen\ntial to their message. A group that can limit membership\nto those who agree in full with its aims and purposes may\nbe more effective in delivering its message or furthering\nits expressive objectives; and the Court has recognized\nthat this interest can be protected against governmental\ninterference or regulation. See Boy Scouts of America v.\nDale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000). By allowing like-minded stu\ndents to form groups around shared identities, a school\ncreates room for self-expression and personal develop\nment. See Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.

Many educational institutions, including respon\ndent Hastings College of Law, have recognized that the\nprocess of learning occurs both formally in a classroom\nsetting and informally outside of it. See id., at 233. Stu\ndents may be shaped as profoundly by their peers as by\ntheir teachers. Extracurricular activities, such as those in\nthe Hastings \u201cRegistered Student Organization\u201d program,\nfacilitate interactions between students, enabling them to\nexplore new points of view, to develop interests and tal\nents, and to nurture a growing sense of self. See Board of\nEd. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie\nCty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 831, n. 4 (2002) (participation\nin extracurricular activities is \u201c \u2018a significant contributor to\nthe breadth and quality of the educational experience\u2019 \u201d).\nThe Hasting program is designed to allow all students to\ninteract with their colleagues across a broad, seemingly\nunlimited range of ideas, views, and activities. See Re\ngents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 312, 313,\nn. 48 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) (\u201c[A] great deal of learn\ning . . . occurs through interactions among students . . .\nwho have a wide variety of interests, talents, and perspec\ntives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn\nfrom their differences and to stimulate one another to\nreexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about\nthemselves and their world\u201d (alteration in original; inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Law students come from many backgrounds and have\nbut three years to meet each other and develop their\nskills.

A vibrant dialogue is not possible if\nstudents wall themselves off from opposing points of view.\n   The school\u2019s objectives thus might not be well served if,\nas a condition to membership or participation in a group,\nstudents were required to avow particular personal beliefs\nor to disclose private, off-campus behavior. Students\nwhose views are in the minority at the school would likely\nfare worse in that regime. Indeed, were those sorts of\nrequirements to become prevalent, it might undermine the\nprinciple that in a university community\u2014and in a law\nschool community specifically\u2014speech is deemed persua\nsive based on its substance, not the identity of the\nspeaker. The era of loyalty oaths is behind us. A school\nquite properly may conclude that allowing an oath or\nbelief-affirming requirement, or an outside conduct re\nquirement, could be divisive for student relations and\ninconsistent with the basic concept that a view\u2019s validity\nshould be tested through free and open discussion. The\nschool\u2019s policy therefore represents a permissible effort to\npreserve the value of its forum.\n   In addition to a circumstance, already noted, in which it\ncould be demonstrated that a school has adopted or en\nforced its policy with the intent or purpose of discriminat\ning or disadvantaging a group on account of its views,\npetitioner also would have a substantial case on the merits\nif it were shown that the all-comers policy was either\ndesigned or used to infiltrate the group or challenge its\nleadership in order to stifle its views. But that has not\nbeen shown to be so likely or self-evident as a matter of\ngroup dynamics in this setting that the Court can declare\nthe school policy void without more facts; and if there were\na showing that in a particular case the purpose or effect of\nthe policy was to stifle speech or make it ineffective, that,\ntoo, would present a case different from the one before us.\n   These observations are offered to support the analysis\nset forth in the opinion of the Court, which I join.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court does not address the constitutionality of\nthe very different policy that Hastings invoked when it\ndenied CLS\u2019s application for registration. Nor does the\nCourt address the constitutionality of the policy that\nHastings now purports to follow. And the Court ignores\nstrong evidence that the accept-all-comers policy is not\nviewpoint neutral because it was announced as a pretext\nto justify viewpoint discrimination. Brushing aside incon\nvenient precedent, the Court arms public educational\ninstitutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the\nspeech of unpopular groups\u2014groups to which, as Hastings\ncandidly puts it, these institutions \u201cdo not wish to . . . lend\ntheir name[s].\u201d Brief for Respondent Hastings College of\nLaw 11; see also id., at 35.\n                              I\n  The Court provides a misleading portrayal of this case.\nAs related by the Court, (1) Hastings, for the past 20\nyears, has required any student group seeking registration\nto admit any student who wishes to join, ante, at 5; (2) the\neffects of Hastings\u2019 refusal to register CLS have been of\nquestionable importance, see ante, at 24\u201325; and (3) this\ncase is about CLS\u2019s desire to obtain \u201ca state subsidy,\u201d ante,\nat 15.

Overwhelming\nevidence, however, shows that Hastings denied CLS\u2019s\napplication pursuant to the Nondiscrimination Policy and\nthat the accept-all-comers policy was nowhere to be found\nuntil it was mentioned by a former dean in a deposition\ntaken well after this case began.\n   The events that gave rise to this litigation began in\n2004, when a small group of Hastings students sought to\nregister a Hastings chapter of CLS, a national organiza\ntion of Christian lawyers and law students. All CLS\nmembers must sign a Statement of Faith affirming belief\nin fundamental Christian doctrines, including the belief\nthat the Bible is \u201cthe inspired Word of God.\u201d App. 226. In\nearly 2004, the national organization adopted a resolution\nstating that \u201c[i]n view of the clear dictates of Scripture,\nunrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually\nimmoral lifestyle is inconsistent with an affirmation of the\nStatement of Faith, and consequently may be regarded by\nCLS as disqualifying such an individual from CLS mem\nbership.\u201d Id., at 146. The resolution made it clear that \u201ca\nsexually immoral lifestyle,\u201d in CLS\u2019s view, includes engag\ning in \u201cacts of sexual conduct outside of God\u2019s design for\nmarriage between one man and one woman.\u201d Ibid. It was\nshortly after this resolution was passed that the Hastings\nchapter of CLS applied to register with the law school.\n   Hastings sponsors an active program of \u201cregistered\nstudent organizations\u201d (RSOs) pursuant to the law school\u2019s\navowed responsibility to \u201censure an opportunity for the\nexpression of a variety of viewpoints\u201d and promote \u201cthe\nhighest standards of . . . freedom of expression,\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 82a, 74a.

As far as the record re\nflects, Ms. Chapman made no mention of an accept-all\napplicants policy.\n   A few days later, three officers of the chapter met with\nMs. Chapman, and she reiterated that the CLS bylaws did\nnot comply with \u201cthe religion and sexual orientation provi\nsions of the Nondiscrimination Policy and that they would\nneed to be amended in order for CLS to become a regis\ntered student organization.\u201d Id., at 228. About a week\nlater, Hastings sent CLS a letter to the same effect. Id., at\n228\u2013229, 293\u2013295.

In response, Hastings\nadmitted that its Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cpermits politi\ncal, social, and cultural student organizations to select\nofficers and members who are dedicated to a particular set\nof ideals or beliefs.\u201d Id., at 93. The Court states that\n\u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it\nrelates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all\ncomers.\u201d Ante, at 4. But this admission in Hastings\u2019\nanswer shows that Hastings had not adopted this inter\npretation when its answer was filed.\n   Within a few months, however, Hastings\u2019 position\nchanged. In July 2005, Mary Kay Kane, then the dean of\nthe law school, was deposed, and she stated: \u201cIt is my view\nthat in order to be a registered student organization you\nhave to allow all of our students to be members and full\nparticipants if they want to.\u201d App. 343. In a declaration\nfiled in October 2005, Ms. Chapman provided a more\ndeveloped explanation, stating: \u201cHastings interprets the\nNondiscrimination Policy as requiring that student or\nganizations wishing to register with Hastings allow any\nHastings student to become a member and/or seek a lead\nership position in the organization.\u201d Id., at 349.\n   Hastings claims that this accept-all-comers policy has\nexisted since 1990 but points to no evidence that the policy\nwas ever put in writing or brought to the attention of\nmembers of the law school community prior to the dean\u2019s\ndeposition. Indeed, Hastings has adduced no evidence of\nthe policy\u2019s existence before that date. And while Dean\nKane and Ms. Chapman stated, well after this litigation\nhad begun, that Hastings had such a policy, neither they\nnor any other Hastings official has ever stated in a deposi\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

First, the two policies\nare simply not the same: The Nondiscrimination Policy\nproscribes discrimination on a limited number of specified\ngrounds, while the accept-all-comers policy outlaws all\nselectivity. Second, the Nondiscrimination Policy applies\nto everything that Hastings does, and the law school does\nnot follow an accept-all-comers policy in activities such as\nadmitting students and hiring faculty.\n   In an effort to circumvent this problem, the Court writes\nthat \u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as\nit relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all\ncomers.\u201d Ante, at 4 (emphasis added). This puts Hastings\nin the implausible position of maintaining that the Non\ndiscrimination Policy means one thing as applied to the\nRSO program and something quite different as applied to\nall of Hastings\u2019 other activities. But the Nondiscrimina\ntion Policy by its terms applies fully to all components of\nthe law school, \u201cincluding administration [and] faculty.\u201d\nApp. 220.\n   Third, the record is replete with evidence that, at least\nuntil Dean Kane unveiled the accept-all-comers policy in\nJuly 2005, Hastings routinely registered student groups\nwith bylaws limiting membership and leadership positions\nto those who agreed with the groups\u2019 viewpoints. For\nexample, the bylaws of the Hastings Democratic Caucus\nprovided that \u201cany full-time student at Hastings may\nbecome a member of HDC so long as they do not exhibit a\nconsistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of\nthe organization as stated in Article 3, Section 1.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 118a (emphasis added).

La\nRaza limited voting membership to \u201cstudents of Raza\nbackground.\u201d App. 192. Since Hastings requires any\nstudent group applying for registration to submit a copy of\nits bylaws, see id., at 249\u2013250, Hastings cannot claim that\nit was unaware of such provisions. And as noted, CLS was\ndenied registration precisely because Ms. Chapman re\nviewed its bylaws and found them unacceptable.\n   We are told that, when CLS pointed out these discrep\nancies during this litigation, Hastings took action to en\nsure that student groups were in fact complying with the\nlaw school\u2019s newly disclosed accept-all-comers policy. For\nexample, Hastings asked La Raza to revise its bylaws to\nallow all students to become voting members. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 66a. See also Brief for State of Michigan et al. as\nAmici Curiae 2, n. 1 (relating anecdotally that Hastings\nrecently notified the Hastings Democrats that \u201cto main\ntain the Club\u2019s standing as a student organization,\u201d it\nmust \u201copen its membership to all students, regardless of\nparty affiliation\u201d). These belated remedial efforts suggest,\nif anything, that Hastings had no accept-all-comers policy\nuntil this litigation was well under way.\n   Finally, when Hastings filed its brief in this Court, its\npolicy, which had already evolved from a policy prohibiting\ncertain specified forms of discrimination into an accept-all\ncomers policy, underwent yet another transformation.\nNow, Hastings claims that it does not really have an\naccept-all-comers policy; it has an accept-some-comers\npolicy.

What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation\nfiled in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all\ncomers policy. CLS did not stipulate that its application\nhad been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such\na policy. On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that\nthe reason repeatedly given by Hasting at that time was\nthat the CLS bylaws did not comply with the Nondis\ncrimination Policy. See App. 228\u2013229. Indeed, the parties\ndid not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy\nexisted in the fall of 2004.

Community\nFirst Bank, 123 F. 3d 1243, 1248 (CA9 1997) (quoting\nLacelaw, supra). As noted above, Hastings admitted in its\nanswer, which was filed prior to the former dean\u2019s deposi\ntion, that at least as of that time, the law school did not\nfollow an accept-all-comers policy and instead allowed\n\u201cpolitical, social, and cultural student organizations to\nselect officers and members who are dedicated to a par\nticular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93.\n                              B\n   The Court also distorts the record with respect to the\neffect on CLS of Hastings\u2019 decision to deny registration.\nThe Court quotes a letter written by Hastings\u2019 general\ncounsel in which she stated that Hastings \u201c \u2018would be\npleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for\nits meetings and activities.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting App.\n294). Later in its opinion, the Court reiterates that \u201cHast\nings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct\nmeetings,\u201d ante, at 24, but the majority does not mention\nthat this offer was subject to important qualifications. As\nHastings\u2019 attorney put it in the District Court, Hastings\ntold CLS: \u201c \u2018Hastings allows community groups to some\ndegree to use its facilities, sometimes on a pay basis, I\nunderstand, if they\u2019re available after priority is given to\nregistered organizations\u2019.

According to the majority, CLS is \u201cseeking what\nis effectively a state subsidy,\u201d ante, at 15, and the question\npresented in this case centers on the \u201cuse of school funds,\u201d\nante, at 1. In fact, funding plays a very small role in this\ncase. Most of what CLS sought and was denied\u2014such as\npermission to set up a table on the law school patio\u2014\nwould have been virtually cost free. If every such activity\nis regarded as a matter of funding, the First Amendment\nrights of students at public universities will be at the\nmercy of the administration. As CLS notes, \u201c[t]o univer\nsity students, the campus is their world. The right to\nmeet on campus and use campus channels of communica\ntion is at least as important to university students as the\nright to gather on the town square and use local communi\ncation forums is to the citizen.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n13.\n                             II\n  To appreciate how far the Court has strayed, it is in\nstructive to compare this case with Healy v. James, 408\nU. S. 169 (1972), our only First Amendment precedent\ninvolving a public college\u2019s refusal to recognize a student\ngroup. The group in Healy was a local chapter of the\nStudents for a Democratic Society (SDS). When the stu\ndents who applied for recognition of the chapter were\nasked by a college committee whether they would \u201c \u2018re\nspond to issues of violence as other S.D.S. chapters have,\u2019 \u201d\ntheir answer was that their \u201c \u2018action would have to be\n14   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

They simi\nlarly refused to provide a definitive answer when asked\nwhether they would be willing to \u201cuse any means possible\u201d\nto achieve their aims. Id., at 173. The president of the\ncollege refused to allow the group to be recognized, con\ncluding that the philosophy of the SDS was \u201cantithetical to\nthe school\u2019s policies\u201d and that it was doubtful that the\nlocal chapter was independent of the national organiza\ntion, the \u201c \u2018published aims and philosophy\u2019 \u201d of which in\ncluded \u201c \u2018disruption and violence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 174\u2013175, and\nn. 4.\n   The effects of nonrecognition in Healy were largely the\nsame as those present here. The SDS was denied the use\nof campus facilities, as well as access to the customary\nmeans used for communication among the members of the\ncollege community. Id., at 176, 181\u2013182.\n   The lower federal courts held that the First Amendment\nrights of the SDS chapter had not been violated, and when\nthe case reached this Court, the college, much like today\u2019s\nmajority, sought to minimize the effects of nonrecognition,\narguing that the SDS members \u201cstill may meet as a group\noff campus, that they still may distribute written material\noff campus, and that they still may meet together infor\nmally on campus . . . as individuals.\u201d Id., at 182\u2013183.\n   This Court took a different view. The Court held that\nthe denial of recognition substantially burdened the stu\ndents\u2019 right to freedom of association. After observing that\n\u201c[t]he primary impediment to free association flowing from\nnonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for\nmeetings and other appropriate purposes,\u201d id., at 181, the\nCourt continued:\n        \u201cPetitioners\u2019 associational interests also were cir\n     cumscribed by the denial of the use of campus bulletin\n     boards and the school newspaper.

Moreover, the organization\u2019s ability to partici\n    pate in the intellectual give and take of campus de\n    bate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by\n    denial of access to the customary media for communi\n    cating with the administration, faculty members, and\n    other students. Such impediments cannot be viewed\n    as insubstantial.\u201d Id., at 181\u2013182.\n   It is striking that all of these same burdens are now\nborne by CLS. CLS is prevented from using campus facili\nties\u2014unless at some future time Hastings chooses to\nprovide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the\ngroup, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set\nup a table on the patio or to use a room that would other\nwise be unoccupied. And CLS, like the SDS in Healy, has\nbeen cut off from \u201cthe customary media for communicating\nwith the administration, faculty members, and other\nstudents.\u201d Id., at 181\u2013182.\n   It is also telling that the Healy Court, unlike today\u2019s\nmajority, refused to defer to the college president\u2019s judg\nment regarding the compatibility of \u201csound educational\npolicy\u201d and free speech rights. The same deference argu\nments that the majority now accepts were made in defense\nof the college president\u2019s decision to deny recognition in\nHealy. Respondents in that case emphasized that the\ncollege president, not the courts, had the responsibility of\nadministering the institution and that the courts should\nallow him \u201c \u2018wide discretion . . . in determining what ac\ntions are most compatible with its educational objectives.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondents in Healy v.

Unlike the\nCourt today, the Healy Court emphatically rejected the\nproposition that \u201cFirst Amendment protections should\napply with less force on college campuses than in the\ncommunity at large.\u201d 408 U. S., at 180. And on one key\nquestion after another\u2014whether the local SDS chapter\nwas independent of the national organization, whether the\ngroup posed a substantial threat of material disruption,\nand whether the students\u2019 responses to the committee\u2019s\nquestions about violence and disruption signified a will\ningness to engage in such activities\u2014the Court drew\nits own conclusions, which differed from the college\npresident\u2019s.\n   The Healy Court was true to the principle that when it\ncomes to the interpretation and application of the right to\nfree speech, we exercise our own independent judgment.\nWe do not defer to Congress on such matters, see Sable\nCommunications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 129\n(1989), and there is no reason why we should bow to uni\nversity administrators.\n   In the end, I see only two possible distinctions between\nHealy and the present case. The first is that Healy did not\ninvolve any funding, but as I have noted, funding plays\nonly a small part in this case. And if Healy would other\nwise prevent Hastings from refusing to register CLS, I see\nno good reason why the potential availability of funding\nshould enable Hastings to deny all of the other rights that\ngo with registration.\n   This leaves just one way of distinguishing Healy: the\nidentity of the student group. In Healy, the Court warned\nthat the college president\u2019s views regarding the philosophy\nof the SDS could not \u201cjustify the denial of First Amend\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Here, too, disapproval of\nCLS cannot justify Hastings\u2019 actions.2\n                               III\n   The Court pays little attention to Healy and instead\nfocuses solely on the question whether Hastings\u2019 registra\ntion policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited\npublic forum. While I think that Healy is largely control\nling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hast\nings\u2019 actions under our limited public forum cases, which\nlead to exactly the same conclusion.\n   In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program.\nOnce a public university opens a limited public forum, it\n\u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819, 829 (1995). The university \u201cmay not exclude\nspeech where its distinction is not \u2018reasonable in light of\nthe purpose served by the forum.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Corne\nlius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.\n788, 806 (1985)). And the university must maintain strict\nviewpoint neutrality. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\nSystem v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 234 (2000); Rosen\nberger, supra, at 829.\n   This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the\nexpression of religious viewpoints. In an unbroken line of\ndecisions analyzing private religious speech in limited\npublic forums, we have made it perfectly clear that\n\u201c[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court attempts to distinguish Healy on the ground that there\n\nthe college \u201cexplicitly denied the student group official recognition\nbecause of the group\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 15. The same, how\never, is true here. CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimi\nnation Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express\nthrough its membership requirements. See supra, at 5; infra, at 18\u201323.\nAnd there is strong evidence that Hastings abruptly shifted from the\nNondiscrimination Policy to the accept-all-comers policy as a pretext for\nviewpoint discrimination. See infra, at 31\u201335.\n18    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nGood News Club v.

We\nhave also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited\npublic forum are particularly important in the university\nsetting, where \u201cthe State acts against a background of\ntradition of thought and experiment that is at the center\nof our intellectual and philosophic tradition.\u201d Rosenberger,\nsupra, at 835.\n                             IV\n  Analyzed under this framework, Hastings\u2019 refusal to\nregister CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy\nplainly fails.3 As previously noted, when Hastings refused\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitu\n\ntional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. See App. 80.\nParticularly in light of Hastings\u2019 practice of changing its announced\npolicies, these requests are not moot. It is well settled that the volun\ntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in\nwhich the legality of that conduct is challenged. See City of Mesquite v.\nAladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982); see also Allee v.\nMedrano, 416 U. S. 802, 810\u2013811 (1974); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416\nU.

The First Amendment protects the right of\n\u201c \u2018expressive association\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe right to associate\nfor the purpose of speaking.\u201d Rumsfeld v.

And the Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group in\nfringes the group\u2019s freedom of expressive association if the\npresence of that person affects in a significant way the\ngroup\u2019s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d\nDale, supra, at 648.\n    With one important exception, the Hastings Nondis\ncrimination Policy respected that right. As Hastings\nstated in its answer, the Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cper\nmit[ted] political, social, and cultural student organiza\ntions to select officers and members who are dedicated to a\nparticular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93. But the policy\nsingled out one category of expressive associations for\ndisfavored treatment: groups formed to express a religious\nmessage. Only religious groups were required to admit\nstudents who did not share their views. An environmen\ntalist group was not required to admit students who re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndiscrimination Policy are not moot. If, as the Court assumes, the\nparties stipulated that the only relevant policy is the accept-all-comers\npolicy, then the District Court should not have addressed the constitu\ntionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy. But the District Court\napproved both policies, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judg\nment. That judgment remains binding on CLS, so it is only appropriate\nthat CLS be permitted to challenge that determination now. The\nquestion of the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy falls\ncomfortably within the question presented, and CLS raised that issue\nin its brief.

S., at 831. It is no wonder that the\nCourt makes no attempt to defend the constitutionality of\nthe Nondiscrimination Policy.\n   Unlike the Court, JUSTICE STEVENS attempts a defense,\ncontending that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint\nneutral. But his arguments are squarely contrary to\nestablished precedent.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS first argues that the Nondiscrimina\ntion Policy is viewpoint neutral because it \u201cdoes not regu\nlate expression or belief at all\u201d but instead regulates con\nduct. See ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). This Court has\nheld, however, that the particular conduct at issue here\nconstitutes a form of expression that is protected by the\nFirst Amendment. It is now well established that the\nFirst Amendment shields the right of a group to engage in\nexpressive association by limiting membership to persons\nwhose admission does not significantly interfere with the\ngroup\u2019s ability to convey its views. See Dale, supra, at\n648; Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623\n(1984); see also New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of\nNew York, 487 U.

See ante, at 3. This argument is also con\ntrary to established law. In Rosenberger, the dissent,\nwhich JUSTICE STEVENS joined, made exactly this argu\nment. See 515 U. S., at 895\u2013896 (opinion of Souter, J.).\nThe Court disagreed, holding that a policy that treated\nsecular speech more favorably than religious speech dis\ncriminated on the basis of viewpoint.4 515 U. S., at 831.\nThe Court reaffirmed this holding in Good News Club, 533\nU. S., at 112, and n. 4.\n  Here, the Nondiscrimination Policy permitted member\nship requirements that expressed a secular viewpoint. See\nApp. 93. (For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus\nand the Hastings Republicans were allowed to exclude\nmembers who disagreed with their parties\u2019 platforms.)\nBut religious groups were not permitted to express a\nreligious viewpoint by limiting membership to students\nwho shared their religious viewpoints. Under established\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 In Rosenberger the university argued that the denial of student\n\nactivity funding for all groups that sought to express a religious view\npoint was \u201cfacially neutral.\u201d See Brief for Respondents in Rosenberger\nv.

See\n515 U.

It would not mean, for\nexample, that fraternities or sororities could exclude stu\ndents on that basis. As our cases have recognized, the\nright of expressive association permits a group to exclude\nan applicant for membership only if the admission of that\nperson would \u201caffec[t] in a significant way the group\u2019s\nability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d Dale,\n530 U. S., at 648. Groups that do not engage in expressive\nassociation have no such right. Similarly, groups that are\ndedicated to expressing a viewpoint on a secular topic (for\nexample, a political or ideological viewpoint) would have\nno basis for limiting membership based on religion be\ncause the presence of members with diverse religious\nbeliefs would have no effect on the group\u2019s ability to ex\npress its views. But for religious groups, the situation is\nvery different. This point was put well by a coalition of\nMuslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh groups: \u201cOf course\nthere is a strong interest in prohibiting religious discrimi\nnation where religion is irrelevant. But it is fundamen\ntally confused to apply a rule against religious discrimina\ntion to a religious association.\u201d Brief for American Islamic\nCongress et al. as Amici Curiae 3.\n   Sexual orientation.

See ante, at 2, n. 1.\nBut if by religious status he means such things as the religion into\nwhich a person was born or the religion of a person\u2019s ancestors, then\nprohibiting discrimination on such grounds would not involve viewpoint\ndiscrimination. Such immutable characteristics are quite different\nfrom viewpoint.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Hastings would not allow CLS to\nexpress this viewpoint by limiting membership to persons\nwilling to express a sincere agreement with CLS\u2019s views.\nBy contrast, nothing in the Nondiscrimination Policy\nprohibited a group from expressing a contrary viewpoint\nby limiting membership to persons willing to endorse\nthat group\u2019s beliefs. A Free Love Club could require mem\nbers to affirm that they reject the traditional view of sex\nual morality to which CLS adheres. It is hard to see\nhow this can be viewed as anything other than viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n                                V\n  Hastings\u2019 current policy, as announced for the first time\nin the brief filed in this Court, fares no better than the\npolicy that the law school invoked when CLS\u2019s application\nwas denied. According to Hastings\u2019 brief, its new policy,\ncontrary to the position taken by Hastings officials at an\nearlier point in this litigation, really does not require a\nstudent group to accept all comers. Now, Hastings ex\nplains, its policy allows \u201cneutral and generally applicable\nmembership requirements unrelated to \u2018status or beliefs.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 5.

If that is the school\u2019s current policy, it is hard to see\nwhy CLS may not be registered, for what CLS demands is\nthat members foreswear \u201cunrepentant participation in or\nadvocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.\u201d App. 146.

And if that is the case, it is\nincumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct require\nments are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS\u2019s re\nquirement is not allowed. Hastings has made no effort to\nprovide such an explanation.6\n                              VI\n  I come now to the version of Hastings\u2019 policy that the\nCourt has chosen to address. This is not the policy that\nHastings invoked when CLS was denied registration. Nor\nis it the policy that Hastings now proclaims\u2014and pre\nsumably implements. It is a policy that, as far as the\nrecord establishes, was in force only from the time when it\nwas first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until\nHastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010. Why\nwe should train our attention on this particular policy and\nnot the other two is a puzzle. But in any event, it is clear\nthat the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light\nof the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to\nsay on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.\n                            A\n  Once a state university opens a limited forum, it \u201cmust\nrespect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d Rosenber\nger, 515 U.

Access to the forum is not limited\nto groups devoted to particular purposes. The regulations\nprovide that a group applying for registration must submit\nan official document including \u201ca statement of its purpose,\u201d\nid., at 83a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.A.1 (emphasis\nadded)), but the regulations make no attempt to define the\nlimits of acceptable purposes. The regulations do not\nrequire a group seeking registration to show that it has a\ncertain number of members or that its program is of inter\nest to any particular number of Hastings students. Nor do\nthe regulations require that a group serve a need not met\nby existing groups.\n   The regulations also make it clear that the registration\nprogram is not meant to stifle unpopular speech. They\nproclaim that \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the Dean to\nensure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a\nvariety of viewpoints.\u201d Id., at 82a (Hastings Regulations\n\u00a733.11). They also emphatically disclaim any endorse\nment of or responsibility for views that student groups\nmay express. Id., at 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.D).\n   Taken as a whole, the regulations plainly contemplate\nthe creation of a forum within which Hastings students\nare free to form and obtain registration of essentially the\nsame broad range of private groups that nonstudents may\nform off campus. That is precisely what the parties in this\ncase stipulated: The RSO forum \u201cseeks to promote a diver\nsity of viewpoints among registered student organizations,\nincluding viewpoints on religion and human sexuality.\u201d\nApp. 216 (emphasis added).\n   The way in which the RSO forum actually developed\ncorroborates this design. As noted, Hastings had more\nthan 60 RSOs in 2004\u20132005, each with its own independ\nently devised purpose. Some addressed serious social\nissues; others\u2014for example, the wine appreciation and\nultimate Frisbee clubs\u2014were simply recreational. Some\n26   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV.

MARTINEZ\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\norganizations focused on a subject but did not claim to\npromote a particular viewpoint on that subject (for exam\nple, the Association of Communications, Sports & Enter\ntainment Law); others were defined, not by subject, but by\nviewpoint. The forum did not have a single Party Politics\nClub; rather, it featured both the Hastings Democratic\nCaucus and the Hastings Republicans. There was no\nReproductive Issues Club; the forum included separate\npro-choice and pro-life organizations. Students did not see\nfit to create a Monotheistic Religions Club, but they have\nformed the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association\nand the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students. In\nshort, the RSO forum, true to its design, has allowed\nHastings students to replicate on campus a broad array of\nprivate, independent, noncommercial organizations that is\nvery similar to those that nonstudents have formed in the\noutside world.\n   The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design\nof the RSO forum for the same reason that a state-imposed\naccept-all-comers policy would violate the First Amend\nment rights of private groups if applied off campus. As\nexplained above, a group\u2019s First Amendment right of\nexpressive association is burdened by the \u201cforced inclu\nsion\u201d of members whose presence would \u201caffec[t] in a\nsignificant way the group\u2019s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.\u201d Dale, 530 U. S., at 648. The Court\nhas therefore held that the government may not compel a\ngroup that engages in \u201cexpressive association\u201d to admit\nsuch a member unless the government has a compelling\ninterest, \u201c \u2018unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that\ncannot be achieved through means significantly less re\nstrictive of associational freedoms.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Rob\nerts, 468 U. S., at 623).\n   There can be no dispute that this standard would not\npermit a generally applicable law mandating that private\nreligious groups admit members who do not share the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngroups\u2019 beliefs. Religious groups like CLS obviously en\ngage in expressive association, and no legitimate state\ninterest could override the powerful effect that an accept\nall-comers law would have on the ability of religious\ngroups to express their views. The State of California\nsurely could not demand that all Christian groups admit\nmembers who believe that Jesus was merely human.\nJewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites\nand Holocaust deniers. Muslim groups could not be forced\nto admit persons who are viewed as slandering Islam.\n   While there can be no question that the State of Califor\nnia could not impose such restrictions on all religious\ngroups in the State, the Court now holds that Hastings, a\nstate institution, may impose these very same require\nments on students who wish to participate in a forum that\nis designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.\nThe Court lists four justifications offered by Hastings in\ndefense of the accept-all-comers policy and, deferring to\nthe school\u2019s judgment, ante, at 21, the Court finds all those\njustifications satisfactory, ante, at 21\u201324. If we carry\nout our responsibility to exercise our own independent\njudgment, however, we must conclude that the justifica\ntions offered by Hastings and accepted by the Court are\ninsufficient.\n   The Court first says that the accept-all-comers policy is\nreasonable because it helps Hastings to ensure that \u201c \u2018lead\nership, educational, and social opportunities\u2019 \u201d are afforded\nto all students. Ante, at 21\u201322 (quoting Brief for Respon\ndent Hastings College of Law 32). The RSO forum, how\never, is designed to achieve these laudable ends in a very\ndifferent way\u2014by permitting groups of students, no mat\nter how small, to form the groups they want. In this way,\nthe forum multiplies the opportunity for students to serve\nin leadership positions; it allows students to decide which\neducational opportunities they wish to pursue through\nparticipation in extracurricular activities; and it permits\n28    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

It would be \u201ca daunting labor,\u201d the\nCourt warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether\na group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to\nstatus. Ante, at 22; see also ante, at 2\u20133, n. 1 (opinion\nof STEVENS, J.) (referring to the \u201cimpossible task of\nseparating out belief-based from status-based religious\ndiscrimination\u201d).\n  This is a strange argument, since the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy prohibits discrimination on substantially the same\ngrounds as the antidiscrimination provisions of many\nStates,7 including California, and except for the inclusion\nof the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orien\ntation, the Nondiscrimination Policy also largely tracks\nfederal antidiscrimination laws.8 Moreover, Hastings now\nwillingly accepts greater burdens under its latest policy,\nwhich apparently requires the school to distinguish be\ntween certain \u201cconduct requirements\u201d that are allowed\nand others that are not. Nor is Hastings daunted by the\nlabor of determining whether a club admissions exam\nlegitimately tests knowledge or is a pretext for screening\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See, e.g., Cal. Gov. Code Ann. \u00a712940(a) (West 2005); N. J. Stat.\n\nAnn. \u00a710:5\u201312(a) (West 2002); N. Y. Exec. Law Ann. \u00a7296(1)(a) (West\n2010).\n  8 See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.

The long history of disputes about the\nmeaning of Bible passages belies any suggestion that it\nwould be an easy task to determine whether the grading of\nsuch a test was \u201cobjective.\u201d\n   Third, the Court argues that the accept-all-comers\npolicy, by bringing together students with diverse views,\nencourages tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the de\nvelopment of conflict-resolution skills. Ante, at 23. These\nare obviously commendable goals, but they are not un\ndermined by permitting a religious group to restrict mem\nbership to persons who share the group\u2019s faith. Many\nreligious groups impose such restrictions. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Agudath Israel of America as Amicus Curiae 3\n(\u201c[B]ased upon millennia-old Jewish laws and traditions,\nOrthodox Jewish institutions . . . regularly differentiate\nbetween Jews and non-Jews\u201d). Such practices are not\nmanifestations of \u201ccontempt\u201d for members of other faiths.\nCf. ante, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (invoking groups\nthat have \u201ccontempt for Jews, blacks, and women\u201d). Nor\ndo they thwart the objectives that Hastings endorses. Our\ncountry as a whole, no less than the Hastings College of\nLaw, values tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the\namicable resolution of conflicts. But we seek to achieve\nthose goals through \u201c[a] confident pluralism that conduces\nto civil peace and advances democratic consensus\nbuilding,\u201d not by abridging First Amendment rights. Brief\nfor Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty as Amicus\nCuriae 35.\n   Fourth, the Court observes that Hastings\u2019 policy \u201cincor\nporates\u2014in fact, subsumes\u2014state-law proscriptions on\ndiscrimination.\u201d Ante, at 23. Because the First Amend\nment obviously takes precedence over any state law, this\n30   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould not justify the Hastings policy even if it were true\u2014\nbut it is not. The only Hastings policy considered by the\nCourt\u2014the accept-all-comers policy\u2014goes far beyond any\nCalifornia antidiscrimination law. Neither Hastings nor\nthe Court claims that California law demands that state\nentities must accept all comers. Hastings itself certainly\ndoes not follow this policy in hiring or student admissions.\n   Nor is it at all clear that California law requires Hast\nings to deny registration to a religious group that limits\nmembership to students who share the group\u2019s religious\nbeliefs. Hastings cites no California court decision or\nadministrative authority addressing this question. In\nstead, Hastings points to a statute prohibiting discrimina\ntion on specified grounds, including religion or sexual\norientation, \u201cin any program or activity conducted by\u201d\ncertain postsecondary educational institutions. Cal. Educ.\nCode Ann. \u00a766270 (West Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).\nHastings, however, does not conduct the activities of the\nstudent groups it registers. Indeed, Hastings disclaims\nsuch responsibility, stating both in its regulations and its\nHandbook for Student Organizations that it \u201cdoes not\nsponsor student organizations and therefore does not\naccept liability for activities of student organizations.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.D);\nApp. 250. In addition, as CLS notes, another provision of\nCalifornia law specifically exempts \u201cany funds that are\nused directly or indirectly for the benefit of student or\nganizations\u201d from a ban on state funding of private groups\nthat discriminate on any of the grounds listed in \u00a766270.\nSee \u00a792150 (West Supp. 2010).\n   The authority to decide whether \u00a766270 or any other\nprovision of California law requires religious student\ngroups at covered institutions to admit members who do\nnot share the groups\u2019 religious views is of course a ques\ntion of state law that we cannot resolve. The materials\nthat have been brought to our attention, however, provide\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The Court proclaims\nthat it would be \u201chard to imagine a more viewpoint\nneutral policy,\u201d ante, at 28, but I would not be so quick to\njump to this conclusion. Even if it is assumed that the\npolicy is viewpoint neutral on its face,10 there is strong\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Although we have held that the sponsor of a limited public forum\n\n\u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set,\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829, the Court now says that, if the exclusion of a group is\nchallenged, the sponsor can retroactively redraw the boundary lines in\norder to justify the exclusion. See ante, at 21, n. 17. This approach\ndoes not respect our prior holding.\n   10 In Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529\n\nU. S. 217 (2000), the Court considered a university rule permitting the\n\u201cdefund[ing]\u201d of a registered student group through a student referen\ndum. See id., at 224\u2013225. \u201cTo the extent the referendum substitutes\nmajority determinations for viewpoint neutrality,\u201d the Court observed,\n\u201cit would undermine the constitutional protection the [university\u2019s\nregistered student organization] program requires.\u201d Id., at 235. \u201cThe\nwhole theory of viewpoint neutrality is that minority views are treated\nwith the same respect as are majority views.\u201d Ibid.\n   Hastings\u2019 accept-all-comers policy bears a resemblance to the South\nwark referendum process. Both permit the majority to silence a disfa\nvored organization. There is force to CLS\u2019s argument that \u201c[a]llowing\nall students to join and lead any group, even when they disagree with\nit, is tantamount to establishing a majoritarian heckler\u2019s veto\u201d and\n\u201cpotentially turn[s] every group into an organ for the already-dominant\nopinion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 51.\n   The Court attempts to distinguish Southworth as involving a funding\nmechanism for student groups that operated selectively, based on\ngroups\u2019 viewpoints.

OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nevidence in the record that the policy was announced as a\npretext.\n   The adoption of a facially neutral policy for the purpose\nof suppressing the expression of a particular viewpoint is\nviewpoint discrimination. See Crawford v. Board of Ed. of\nLos Angeles, 458 U. S. 527, 544 (1982) (\u201c[A] law neutral on\nits face still may be unconstitutional if motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose\u201d). A simple example illustrates\nthis obvious point. Suppose that a hated student group at\na state university has never been able to attract more than\n10 members. Suppose that the university administration,\nfor the purpose of preventing that group from using the\nschool grounds for meetings, adopts a new rule under\nwhich the use of its facilities is restricted to groups with\nmore than 25 members. Although this rule would be\nneutral on its face, its adoption for a discriminatory reason\nwould be illegal.\n   Here, CLS has made a strong showing that Hastings\u2019\nsudden adoption and selective application of its accept-all\ncomers policy was a pretext for the law school\u2019s unlawful\ndenial of CLS\u2019s registration application under the Nondis\ncrimination Policy.\n   Shifting policies. When Hastings denied CLS\u2019s applica\ntion in the fall of 2004, the only policy mentioned was the\nNondiscrimination Policy. In July 2005, the former dean\nsuggested in a deposition that the law school actually\nfollowed the very different accept-all-comers policy. In\nMarch of this year, Hastings\u2019 brief in this Court rolled out\nstill a third policy. As is recognized in the employment\ndiscrimination context, where issues of pretext regularly\narise, \u201c[s]ubstantial changes over time in [an] employer\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npay fees which are subsidies for speech they find objectionable, even\noffensive,\u201d solely upon a majority vote of the student body. See 529\nU. S., at 230, 235. That is no different in principle than an accept-all\ncomers policy that places all student organizations at risk of take-over\nby a majority that is hostile to a group\u2019s viewpoint.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc., 280 F. 3d\n579, 592 (CA6 2001).\n   Timing. The timing of Hastings\u2019 revelation of its new\npolicies closely tracks the law school\u2019s litigation posture.\nWhen Hastings denied CLS registration, it cited only the\nNondiscrimination Policy. Later, after CLS alleged that\nthe Nondiscrimination Policy discriminated against reli\ngious groups, Hastings unveiled its accept-all-comers\npolicy. Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS\u2019s open\ning brief challenged the constitutionality\u2014and the plausi\nbility\u2014of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed\na new policy. As is true in the employment context,\n\u201c[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes\nduring litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue\nwhether the proffered reason truly motivated the defen\ndant\u2019s decision.\u201d Cicero, supra, at 592.\n   Lack of documentation. When an employer has a writ\nten policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no\nwritten documentation, that deviation may support an\ninference of pretext. See, e.g., Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd.\nPartnership, 521 F. 3d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); Rudin v.\nLincoln Land Community College, 420 F. 3d 712, 727 (CA7\n2005); Machinchick v.

Callaway, 698 F. 2d\n395, 399\u2013400, 401 (CA10 1983).\n   Here, Hastings claims that it has had an accept-all\ncomers policy since 1990, but it has not produced a single\nwritten document memorializing that policy. Nor has it\ncited a single occasion prior to the dean\u2019s deposition when\nthis putative policy was orally disclosed to either student\ngroups interested in applying for registration or to the\n34    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

Since it appears that no one was told\nabout the accept-all-comers policy before July 2005, it is\nnot surprising that the policy was not enforced. The re\ncord is replete with evidence that Hastings made no effort\nto enforce the all-comers policy until after it was pro\nclaimed by the former dean. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for\nCert. 118a (Hastings Democratic Caucus); id., at 110a\n(Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings); id.,\nat 146a\u2013147a (Vietnamese American Law Society); id., at\n142a\u2013143a (Silent Right); App. 192 (La Raza). See gener\nally supra, at 7\u20138. If the record here is not sufficient to\npermit a finding of pretext, then the law of pretext is dead.\n  The Court\u2014understandably\u2014sidesteps this issue. The\nCourt states that the lower courts did not address the\n\u201cargument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comer\npolicy,\u201d11 that \u201cthis Court is not the proper forum to air the\nissue in the first instance,\u201d and that \u201c[o]n remand, the\nNinth Circuit may consider CLS\u2019s pretext argument if,\nand to the extent, it is preserved.\u201d Ante, at 31\u201332.\n  Because the Court affirms the entry of summary judg\nment in favor of respondents, it is not clear how CLS will\nbe able to ask the Ninth Circuit on remand to review its\nclaim of pretext.

And as the record shows,\nCLS has never ceded its argument that Hastings applies its accept-all\ncomers policy unequally.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

If it is\nappropriate for us to consider that issue, then the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s failure to address the issue of pretext should not\nstand in the way of review by this Court.\n                            C\n   One final aspect of the Court\u2019s decision warrants com\nment. In response to the argument that the accept-all\ncomers-policy would permit a small and unpopular group\nto be taken over by students who wish to silence its mes\nsage, the Court states that the policy would permit a\nregistered group to impose membership requirements\n\u201cdesigned to ensure that students join because of their\ncommitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its demise.\u201d Ante, at\n27. With this concession, the Court tacitly recognizes that\nHastings does not really have an accept-all-comers pol\nicy\u2014it has an accept-some-dissident-comers policy\u2014and\nthe line between members who merely seek to change a\ngroup\u2019s message (who apparently must be admitted) and\nthose who seek a group\u2019s \u201cdemise\u201d (who may be kept out)\nis hopelessly vague.\n   Here is an example. Not all Christian denominations\nagree with CLS\u2019s views on sexual morality and other\nmatters. During a recent year, CLS had seven members.\nSuppose that 10 students who are members of denomina\ntions that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was mis\nrepresenting true Christian doctrine. Suppose that these\nstudents joined CLS, elected officers who shared their\n36   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

The new\nleadership would likely proclaim that the group was \u201cvi\ntal\u201d but rectified, while CLS, I assume, would take the\nview that the old group had suffered its \u201cdemise.\u201d\nWhether a change represents reform or transformation\nmay depend very much on the eye of the beholder.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY takes a similarly mistaken tack. He\ncontends that CLS \u201cwould have a substantial case on the\nmerits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was . . .\nused to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in\norder to stifle its views,\u201d ante, at 4 (concurring opinion),\nbut he does not explain on what ground such a claim could\nsucceed. The Court holds that the accept-all-comers policy\nis viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the pur\nposes of the RSO forum. How could those characteristics\nbe altered by a change in the membership of one of the\nforum\u2019s registered groups? No explanation is apparent.\n   In the end, the Court refuses to acknowledge the conse\nquences of its holding. A true accept-all-comers policy\npermits small unpopular groups to be taken over by stu\ndents who wish to change the views that the group ex\npresses. Rules requiring that members attend meetings,\npay dues, and behave politely, see ante, at 27, would not\neliminate this threat.\n   The possibility of such takeovers, however, is by no\nmeans the most important effect of the Court\u2019s holding.\nThere are religious groups that cannot in good conscience\nagree in their bylaws that they will admit persons who do\nnot share their faith, and for these groups, the conse\nquence of an accept-all-comers policy is marginalization.\nSee Brief for Evangelical Scholars (Officers and 24 Former\nPresidents of the Evangelical Theological Society) et al. as\nAmici Curiae 19 (affirmance in this case \u201cwill allow every\npublic college and university in the United States to ex\nclude all evangelical Christian organizations\u201d); Brief for\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This is where the Court\u2019s deci\nsion leads.\n                         *    *    *\n   I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today\u2019s\ndecision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in\nthis country.

Even those who find CLS\u2019s views objectionable\nshould be concerned about the way the group has been\ntreated\u2014by Hastings, the Court of Appeals, and now this\nCourt. I can only hope that this decision will turn out to\nbe an aberration.\n",

MARTINEZ ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131371. Argued April 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 28, 2010\nRespondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the\n  University of California public-school system, extends official recog\n  nition to student groups through its \u201cRegistered Student Organiza\n  tion\u201d (RSO) program. Several benefits attend this school-approved\n  status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of\n  communication, as well as Hastings\u2019 name and logo. In exchange for\n  recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Critical here, all\n  RSOs must comply with the school\u2019s Nondiscrimination Policy, which\n  tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, includ\n  ing religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as\n  it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers:\n  RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or\n  seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.\n     At the beginning of the 2004\u20132005 academic year, the leaders of an\n  existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society\n  (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that char\n  ters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. These\n  chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and of\n  ficers to sign a \u201cStatement of Faith\u201d and to conduct their lives in ac\n  cord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that\n  sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man\n  and a woman. CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation\n  anyone who engages in \u201cunrepentant homosexual conduct\u201d or holds\n  religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.\n2       CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n            HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    Hastings rejected CLS\u2019s application for RSO status on the ground\n    that the group\u2019s bylaws did not comply with Hastings\u2019 open-access\n    policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual\n    orientation.\n       CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42\n    U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that Hastings\u2019 refusal to grant the group\n    RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to\n    free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion. On\n    cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for\n    Hastings. The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a\n    limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and\n    therefore did not violate CLS\u2019s right to free speech. Nor, in the\n    court\u2019s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS\u2019s right to ex\n    pressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any stu\n    dent, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed\n    conditions on the use of school facilities and funds. The court also re\n    jected CLS\u2019s free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimina\n    tion Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral\n    and of general applicability. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that\n    the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and\n    viewpoint neutral.\nHeld:\n     1. The Court considers only whether a public institution\u2019s condi\n tioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an\n all-comers policy violates the Constitution. CLS urges the Court to\n review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as written\u2014prohibiting\n discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual\n orientation. The policy\u2019s written terms, CLS contends, target solely\n those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove\n of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to\n limit membership to persons committed to the group\u2019s ideology. This\n argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties\n submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: \u201cHast\n ings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, . . . re\n gardless of [her] status or beliefs. For example, the Hastings Democ\n ratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs\n . . . .\u201d This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and\n cannot contradict, their stipulations. See, e.g., Board of Regents of\n Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 226. The Court\n therefore rejects CLS\u2019s attempt to escape from the stipulation and\n shift its target to Hastings\u2019 policy as written. Pp. 8\u201312.\n     2. The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condi\n tion on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress\n First Amendment limitations. Pp. 12\u201331.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (a) The Court\u2019s limited public forum decisions supply the appro\npriate framework for assessing both CLS\u2019s free-speech and expres\nsive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmen\ntal entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose\nrestrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of\nthe forum and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visi\ntors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829. CLS urges the Court to apply\nto its expressive-association claim a different line of cases\u2014decisions\nin which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associa\ntional freedom in the context of public accommodations, e.g., Roberts\nv. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623. But, because CLS\u2019s ex\npressive-association and free-speech arguments merge\u2014who speaks\non its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyed\u2014it makes\nlittle sense to treat the claims as discrete. Instead, three observa\ntions lead the Court to analyze CLS\u2019s arguments under limited\npublic-forum precedents.\n   First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a\nless restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as\ncompared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive\nassociation occurring in a limited public forum. Speech and expres\nsive-association rights are closely linked. See id., at 622. When\nthese intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would\nbe anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review\nunder the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an im\npermissible infringement of expressive association. Second, the strict\nscrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden\nexpressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining\ncharacteristic of limited public forums\u2014the State\u2019s authority to \u201cre\nserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\u201d Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829.\nThird, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum\ncategory, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes\nthe benefits of official recognition. The Court\u2019s expressive-association\ndecisions, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to\ninclude unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, e.g., Boy\nScouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648. Application of the less\nrestrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact\nthat Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of\nsubsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition. Pp. 12\u201317.\n      (b) In three cases, this Court held that public universities had\nunconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treat\nment because of their points of view. See Healy v. James, 408 U. S.\n169; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263; and Rosenberger. Most re\ncently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, the Court held that a\nuniversity generally may not withhold benefits from student groups\n4       CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV.

Pp. 19\u201328.\n            (1) The Court\u2019s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in\n    which it arises: \u201cFirst Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of\n    the special characteristics of the school environment.\u201d Widmar, 454\n    U. S., at 268, n. 5. This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public\n    university has exceeded constitutional constraints. The Court has,\n    however, cautioned courts to resist \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions\n    of sound educational policy for those of . . . school authorities,\u201d for\n    judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school ad\n    ministrators. Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist.,\n    Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206. Because schools enjoy\n    \u201ca significant measure of authority over the type of officially recog\n    nized activities in which their students participate,\u201d Board of Ed. of\n    Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226,\n    240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings\u2019 deci\n    sions about the character of its student-group program are due de\n    cent respect. Pp. 19\u201321.\n            (2) The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all\n    comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forum\u2019s purposes.\n    First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social\n    opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students. RSOs\n    are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student\n    activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to\n    fund a group that would reject her as a member. Second, the policy\n    helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Pol\n    icy without inquiring into an RSO\u2019s motivation for membership re\n    strictions. CLS\u2019s proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of\n    belief but forbid discrimination due to status would impose on Hast\n    ings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student or\n    ganization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.\n    Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the\n    extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and\n    beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among stu\n    dents. Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination pro\n    scriptions, thereby conveying Hastings\u2019 decision to decline to subsi\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

So long as a public school\ndoes not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state\nlaw goals stands on firm footing. Pp. 21\u201324.\n        (3) Hastings\u2019 policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the\n\u201csubstantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student]\ncommunication to take place.\u201d Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educa\ntors\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 53. Hastings offered CLS access to school\nfacilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain\nbulletin boards to advertise events. Although CLS could not take ad\nvantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of\nelectronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance\nof those channels. Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities,\ncommonly maintain a presence at universities without official school\naffiliation. CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activi\nties the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of\nstudents attending those meetings and events doubled. \u201cThe variety\nand type of alternative modes of access present here,\u201d in short, \u201ccom\npare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where\n[the Court has] upheld restrictions.\u201d Id., at 53\u201354. Pp. 24\u201325.\n        (4) CLS\u2019s arguments that the all-comers policy is not reason\nable are unavailing. CLS contends that there can be no diversity of\nviewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around\nviewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS\u2019s preferred policy with\nconstitutional limitation\u2014the advisability of Hastings\u2019 policy does\nnot control its permissibility. A State\u2019s restriction on access to a lim\nited public forum, moreover, \u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the\nonly reasonable limitation.\u201d Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808. CLS\u2019s con\ntention that Hastings\u2019 policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs\nby student saboteurs bent on subverting a group\u2019s mission is more\nhypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO\nhijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley,\n524 U. S. 569, 584. Finally, CLS\u2019s assertion that Hastings lacks any\nlegitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co\nreligionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo,\nwhile ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out. Hastings,\ncaught in the crossfire between a group\u2019s desire to exclude and stu\ndents\u2019 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the\nsand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no\ngroup to discriminate in membership.

See\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981);\nHealy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972). This case concerns a\nnovel question regarding student activities at public uni\u00ad\nversities: May a public law school condition its official\nrecognition of a student group\u2014and the attendant use of\nschool funds and facilities\u2014on the organization\u2019s agree\u00ad\nment to open eligibility for membership and leadership to\nall students?\n   In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS),\nan accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment\nrights to free speech, expressive association, and free\nexercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquish\u00ad\ning the advantages of recognition, to accept members who\n2    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndo not share the organization\u2019s core beliefs about religion\nand sexual orientation. From the perspective of respon\u00ad\ndent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law\nSchool), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across\u00ad\nthe-board open-access requirement designed to further the\nreasonable educational purposes underpinning the school\u2019s\nstudent-organization program.\n  In accord with the District Court and the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals, we reject CLS\u2019s First Amendment challenge. Com\u00ad\npliance with Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy, we conclude, is a\nreasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the\nstudent-organization forum. In requiring CLS\u2014in com\u00ad\nmon with all other student organizations\u2014to choose be\u00ad\ntween welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of\nofficial recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress\nconstitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks\nnot parity with other organizations, but a preferential\nexemption from Hastings\u2019 policy. The First Amendment\nshields CLS against state prohibition of the organization\u2019s\nexpressive activity, however exclusionary that activity\nmay be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state\nsubvention of its selectivity.\n                               I\n  Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in\nthe University of California public-school system. Like\nmany institutions of higher education, Hastings encour\u00ad\nages students to form extracurricular associations that\n\u201ccontribute to the Hastings community and experience.\u201d\nApp. 349. These groups offer students \u201copportunities to\npursue academic and social interests outside of the class\u00ad\nroom [to] further their education\u201d and to help them \u201cde\u00ad\nvelo[p] leadership skills.\u201d Ibid.\n  Through its \u201cRegistered Student Organization\u201d (RSO)\nprogram, Hastings extends official recognition to student\ngroups. Several benefits attend this school-approved\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstatus. RSOs are eligible to seek financial assistance from\nthe Law School, which subsidizes their events using funds\nfrom a mandatory student-activity fee imposed on all\nstudents. Id., at 217. RSOs may also use Law-School\nchannels to communicate with students: They may place\nannouncements in a weekly Office-of-Student-Services\nnewsletter, advertise events on designated bulletin boards,\nsend e-mails using a Hastings-organization address, and\nparticipate in an annual Student Organizations Fair\ndesigned to advance recruitment efforts. Id., at 216\u2013219.\nIn addition, RSOs may apply for permission to use the\nLaw School\u2019s facilities for meetings and office space. Id.,\nat 218\u2013219. Finally, Hastings allows officially recognized\ngroups to use its name and logo. Id., at 216.\n   In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must abide by\ncertain conditions. Only a \u201cnon-commercial organization\nwhose membership is limited to Hastings students may\nbecome [an RSO].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. A prospec\u00ad\ntive RSO must submit its bylaws to Hastings for approval,\nid., at 83a\u201384a; and if it intends to use the Law School\u2019s\nname or logo, it must sign a license agreement, App. 219.\nCritical here, all RSOs must undertake to comply with\nHastings\u2019 \u201cPolicies and Regulations Applying to College\nActivities, Organizations and Students.\u201d Ibid.1\n   The Law School\u2019s Policy on Nondiscrimination (Nondis\u00ad\ncrimination Policy), which binds RSOs, states:\n     \u201c[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally\n     impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discrimina\u00ad\n     tory practices. All groups, including administration,\n     faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned stu\u00ad\n     dent residence facilities and programs sponsored by\n     [Hastings], are governed by this policy of nondis\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 These policies and regulations address a wide range of matters, for\n\nexample, alcoholic beverages at campus events, bake sales, and blood\ndrives. App. 246.\n4     CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     crimination. [Hasting\u2019s] policy on nondiscrimination\n     is to comply fully with applicable law.\n     \u201c[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the\n     basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry,\n     disability, age, sex or sexual orientation. This nondis\u00ad\n     crimination policy covers admission, access and\n     treatment in Hastings-sponsored programs and activi\u00ad\n     ties.\u201d Id., at 220.\n   Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it\nrelates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all\ncomers: School-approved groups must \u201callow any student\nto participate, become a member, or seek leadership posi\u00ad\ntions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or\nbeliefs.\u201d Id., at 221.2 Other law schools have adopted\nsimilar all-comers policies. See, e.g., Georgetown Univer\u00ad\nsity Law Center, Office of Student Life: Student Organi\nzations, available at http://www.law.georgetown.edu/\nStudentLife/StudentOrgs/NewGroup.htm (All Internet\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 \u201cTh[is] policy,\u201d Hastings clarifies, \u201cdoes not foreclose neutral and\n\ngenerally applicable membership requirements unrelated to \u2018status or\nbeliefs.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Hastings 5. So long as all students have the oppor\ntunity to participate on equal terms, RSOs may require them, inter alia,\nto pay dues, maintain good attendance, refrain from gross misconduct,\nor pass a skill-based test, such as the writing competitions adminis\u00ad\ntered by law journals. See ibid. The dissent trumpets these neutral,\ngenerally applicable membership requirements, arguing that, in truth,\nHastings has a \u201csome-comers,\u201d not an all-comers, policy. Post, at 2, 3,\n8\u20139, 10, 23\u201324, 32\u201333 (opinion of ALITO, J.). Hastings\u2019 open-access\npolicy, however, requires only that student organizations open eligibil\u00ad\nity for membership and leadership regardless of a student\u2019s status or\nbeliefs; dues, attendance, skill measurements, and comparable uni\u00ad\nformly applied standards are fully compatible with the policy. The\ndissent makes much of Hastings\u2019 observation that groups have imposed\n\u201ceven conduct requirements.\u201d Post, at 9, 23\u201324. But the very example\nHastings cites leaves no doubt that the Law School was referring to\nboilerplate good-behavior standards, e.g., \u201c[m]embership may cease . . .\nif the member is found to be involved in gross misconduct,\u201d App. 173\n(cited in Brief for Hastings 5).\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

From Hastings\u2019 adoption of its Nondis\u00ad\ncrimination Policy in 1990 until the events stirring this\nlitigation, \u201cno student organization at Hastings . . . ever\nsought an exemption from the Policy.\u201d App. 221.\n   In 2004, CLS became the first student group to do so.\nAt the beginning of the academic year, the leaders of a\npredecessor Christian organization\u2014which had been an\nRSO at Hastings for a decade\u2014formed CLS by affiliating\nwith the national Christian Legal Society (CLS-National).\nId., at 222\u2013223, 225. CLS-National, an association of\nChristian lawyers and law students, charters student\nchapters at law schools throughout the country. Id., at\n225. CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia,\nrequire members and officers to sign a \u201cStatement of\nFaith\u201d and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed\nprinciples. Id., at 225\u2013226; App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.3\nAmong those tenets is the belief that sexual activity\nshould not occur outside of marriage between a man and a\nwoman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude from\naffiliation anyone who engages in \u201cunrepentant homosex\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  Statement of Faith provides:\n\n   \u201cTrusting in Jesus Christ as my Savior, I believe in: \n\n\u2022\t One God, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son and Holy\n   Spirit.\n\u2022\t God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.\n\u2022\t The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God\u2019s only Son conceived of the\n   Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary; His vicarious death for our sins\n   through which we receive eternal life; His bodily resurrection and\n   personal return.\n\u2022\t The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the work of regeneration.\n\u2022\t The Bible as the inspired Word of God.\u201d App. 226.\n6    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

CLS also excludes students who\nhold religious convictions different from those in the\nStatement of Faith. Id., at 227.\n   On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an\napplication for RSO status, accompanied by all required\ndocuments, including the set of bylaws mandated by CLS-\nNational. Id., at 227\u2013228. Several days later, the Law\nSchool rejected the application; CLS\u2019s bylaws, Hastings\nexplained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy because CLS barred students based on religion and\nsexual orientation. Id., at 228.\n   CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondis\u00ad\ncrimination Policy, id., at 281, but Hastings declined to\ngrant one. \u201c[T]o be one of our student-recognized organi\u00ad\nzations,\u201d Hastings reiterated, \u201cCLS must open its mem\u00ad\nbership to all students irrespective of their religious be\u00ad\nliefs or sexual orientation.\u201d Id., at 294. If CLS instead\nchose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings\nstated, the school \u201cwould be pleased to provide [CLS] the\nuse of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\u201d\nIbid. CLS would also have access to chalkboards and\ngenerally available campus bulletin boards to announce its\nevents. Id., at 219, 233. In other words, Hastings would\ndo nothing to suppress CLS\u2019s endeavors, but neither would\nit lend RSO-level support for them.\n   Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not obtain RSO\nstatus. It did, however, operate independently during the\n2004\u20132005 academic year. CLS held weekly Bible-study\nmeetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday\nand Easter Sunday church services. Id., at 229. It also\nhosted a beach barbeque, Thanksgiving dinner, campus\nlecture on the Christian faith and the legal practice, sev\u00ad\neral fellowship dinners, an end-of-year banquet, and other\ninformal social activities. Ibid.\n   On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against various\nHastings officers and administrators under 42 U. S. C.\n                   Cite as: 561 U.

Its complaint alleged that Hastings\u2019 refusal to\ngrant the organization RSO status violated CLS\u2019s First\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expres\u00ad\nsive association, and free exercise of religion. The suit\nsought injunctive and declaratory relief.4\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California ruled\nin favor of Hastings. The Law School\u2019s all-comers condi\u00ad\ntion on access to a limited public forum, the court held,\nwas both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore\ndid not violate CLS\u2019s right to free speech. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 27a\u201338a.\n   Nor, in the District Court\u2019s view, did the Law School\nimpermissibly impair CLS\u2019s right to expressive associa\u00ad\ntion. \u201cHastings is not directly ordering CLS to admit [any]\nstuden[t],\u201d the court observed, id., at 42a; \u201c[r]ather, Hast\u00ad\nings has merely placed conditions on\u201d the use of its facili\u00ad\nties and funds, ibid. \u201cHastings\u2019 denial of official recogni\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the court added, \u201cwas not a substantial impediment\nto CLS\u2019s ability to meet and communicate as a group.\u201d Id.,\nat 49a.\n   The court also rejected CLS\u2019s Free Exercise Clause\nargument.       \u201c[T]he Nondiscrimination Policy does not\ntarget or single out religious beliefs,\u201d the court noted;\nrather, the policy \u201cis neutral and of general applicability.\u201d\nId., at 63a. \u201cCLS may be motivated by its religious beliefs\nto exclude students based on their religion or sexual orien\u00ad\ntation,\u201d the court explained, \u201cbut that does not convert the\nreason for Hastings\u2019 [Nondiscrimination Policy] to be one\nthat is religiously-based.\u201d Id., at 63a\u201364a.\n   On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an opinion that\nstated, in full:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The District Court allowed respondent Hastings Outlaw, an RSO\n\ncommitted to \u201ccombating discrimination based on sexual orientation,\u201d\nid., at 97, to intervene in the suit, id., at 104.\n8    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n       \u201cThe parties stipulate that Hastings imposes an\n    open membership rule on all student groups\u2014all\n    groups must accept all comers as voting members\n    even if those individuals disagree with the mission of\n    the group. The conditions on recognition are therefore\n    viewpoint neutral and reasonable. Truth v. Kent Sch.\n    Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 649\u201350 (9th Cir. 2008).\u201d Chris\n    tian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. v. Kane, 319\n    Fed. Appx. 645, 645\u2013646 (CA9 2009).\n  We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ____ (2009), and now\naffirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                              II\n  Before considering the merits of CLS\u2019s constitutional\narguments, we must resolve a preliminary issue: CLS\nurges us to review the Nondiscrimination Policy as writ\u00ad\nten\u2014prohibiting discrimination on several enumerated\nbases, including religion and sexual orientation\u2014and not\nas a requirement that all RSOs accept all comers. The\nwritten terms of the Nondiscrimination Policy, CLS con\u00ad\ntends, \u201ctarge[t] solely those groups whose beliefs are based\non religion or that disapprove of a particular kind of sex\u00ad\nual behavior,\u201d and leave other associations free to limit\nmembership and leadership to individuals committed to\nthe group\u2019s ideology. Brief for Petitioner 19 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). For example, \u201c[a] political . . .\ngroup can insist that its leaders support its purposes and\nbeliefs,\u201d CLS alleges, but \u201ca religious group cannot.\u201d Id.,\nat 20.\n  CLS\u2019s assertion runs headlong into the stipulation of\nfacts it jointly submitted with Hastings at the summary\u00ad\njudgment stage. In that filing, the parties specified:\n    \u201cHastings requires that registered student organiza\u00ad\n    tions allow any student to participate, become a mem\u00ad\n    ber, or seek leadership positions in the organization,\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Thus, for exam\u00ad\n     ple, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar stu\u00ad\n     dents holding Republican political beliefs from becom\u00ad\n     ing members or seeking leadership positions in the\n     organization.\u201d App. 221 (Joint Stipulation \u00b618) (em\u00ad\n     phasis added; citations omitted).5\nUnder the District Court\u2019s local rules, stipulated facts are\ndeemed \u201cundisputed.\u201d Civil Local Rule 56\u20132 (ND Cal.\n2010). See also Pet. for Cert. 2 (\u201cThe material facts of this\ncase are undisputed.\u201d).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In its briefs before the District Court and the Court of Appeals, CLS\n\nseveral times affirmed that Hastings imposes an all-comers rule on\nRSOs. See, e.g., Plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment\nand Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment in No.\nC 04 4484 JSW (ND Cal.), p. 4 (\u201cHastings interprets the [Nondiscrimi\u00ad\nnation Policy] such that student organizations must allow any student,\nregardless of their status or beliefs, to participate in the group\u2019s activi\u00ad\nties and meetings and to become voting members and leaders of the\ngroup.\u201d); Brief for Appellant in No. 06\u201315956 (CA9), pp. 29\u201330 (\u201cHast\u00ad\nings illustrates the application of the Nondiscrimination Policy by\nexplaining that for the Hastings Democratic Caucus to gain recogni\u00ad\ntion, it must open its leadership and voting membership to Republi\u00ad\ncans.\u201d). In a hearing before the District Court, CLS\u2019s counsel reiterated\nthat \u201cit\u2019s important to understand what Hastings\u2019 policy is. According\nto . . . the stipulated facts, Hastings requires . . . that registered student\norganizations allow any student to participate, become a member or\nseek leadership positions in the organization regardless of their status\nor beliefs.\u201d App. 438 (capitalization and internal quotation marks\nomitted). And at oral argument in this Court, counsel for CLS ac\u00ad\nknowledged that \u201cthe Court needs to reach the constitutionality of the\nall-comers policy as applied to CLS in this case.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 59\n(emphasis added). We repeat, in this regard, that Hastings\u2019 all-comers\npolicy is hardly novel. Other law schools have adopted similar re\u00ad\nquirements. See supra, at 4\u20135; Brief for Association of American Law\nSchools as Amicus Curiae 20, n. 5.\n   6 The dissent spills considerable ink attempting to create uncertainty\n\nabout when the all-comers policy was adopted. See post, at 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 10, 11. What counts, however, is the parties\u2019 unqualified agreement\nthat the all-comers policy currently governs. CLS\u2019s suit, after all, seeks\nonly declaratory and injunctive\u2014that is, prospective\u2014relief. See App.\n10    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV.

See 319 Fed. Appx., at 645\u2013646;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; id., at 36a.

See post, at 5\u20136, 11. In context, Hastings\u2019 answer\u2014which\nresponded to CLS\u2019s allegation that the Law School singles out religious\ngroups for discriminatory treatment\u2014is sensibly read to convey that\nHastings\u2019 policies and regulations apply to all groups equally. See App.\n79 (denying that the Nondiscrimination Policy imposes on religious\norganizations restraints that are not applied to political, social, and\ncultural groups). In any event, the parties\u2019 joint stipulation supersedes\nthe answer, to the extent of any conflict between the two filings. See\nPepper & Tanner, Inc. v. Shamrock Broadcasting, Inc., 563 F. 2d 391,\n393 (CA9 1977) (Parties\u2019 \u201cstipulation of facts . . . superseded all prior\npleadings and controlled the subsequent course of the action.\u201d).\n  9 The dissent indulges in make-believe when it suggests that we are\n\nmaking factual findings about Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy. Post, at 1, 2.\nAs CLS\u2019s petition for certiorari stressed, \u201c[t]he material facts of this case\nare undisputed.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 2 (emphasis added).

This opinion,\ntherefore, considers only whether conditioning access to a\nstudent-organization forum on compliance with an all\u00ad\ncomers policy violates the Constitution.10\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In support of the argument that Hastings\u2019 all-comers\npolicy treads on its First Amendment rights to free speech\nand expressive association, CLS draws on two lines of\ndecisions. First, in a progression of cases, this Court has\nemployed forum analysis to determine when a governmen\u00ad\ntal entity, in regulating property in its charge, may place\nlimitations on speech.11 Recognizing a State\u2019s right \u201cto\npreserve the property under its control for the use to\nwhich it is lawfully dedicated,\u201d Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\nDefense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800 (1985) (inter\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The dissent, in contrast, devotes considerable attention to CLS\u2019s\n\narguments about the Nondiscrimination Policy as written. Post, at 2, 3,\n5, 18\u201323. We decline to address these arguments, not because we agree\nwith the dissent that the Nondiscrimination Policy is \u201cplainly\u201d uncon\u00ad\nstitutional, post, at 18, but because, as noted, supra, at 8\u201312, that\nconstitutional question is not properly presented.\n   11 In conducting forum analysis, our decisions have sorted govern\u00ad\n\nment property into three categories. First, in traditional public forums,\nsuch as public streets and parks, \u201cany restriction based on the content\nof . . . speech must satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must\nbe narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\u201d\nPleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).\nSecond, governmental entities create designated public forums when\n\u201cgovernment property that has not traditionally been regarded as a\npublic forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose\u201d; speech\nrestrictions in such a forum \u201care subject to the same strict scrutiny as\nrestrictions in a traditional public forum.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\nThird, governmental entities establish limited public forums by opening\nproperty \u201climited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the\ndiscussion of certain subjects.\u201d Ibid. As noted in text, \u201c[i]n such a\nforum, a governmental entity may impose restrictions on speech that\nare reasonable and viewpoint-neutral.\u201d Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal quotation marks omitted), the Court has permitted\nrestrictions on access to a limited public forum, like the\nRSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access bar\u00ad\nrier must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, e.g.,\nRosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829. See also, e.g., Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107\n(2001); Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free\nSchool Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 392\u2013393 (1993); Perry Ed.\nAssn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 46\n(1983).12\n   Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this\nCourt has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that\nconstrain associational freedom. In the context of public\naccommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that\nfreedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted\nonly if they serve \u201ccompelling state interests\u201d that are\n\u201cunrelated to the suppression of ideas\u201d\u2014interests that\ncannot be advanced \u201cthrough . . . significantly less restric\u00ad\ntive [means].\u201d Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S.\n609, 623 (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v.\nDale, 530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). \u201cFreedom of association,\u201d\nwe have recognized, \u201cplainly presupposes a freedom not to\nassociate.\u201d Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an\norganization embrace unwelcome members, we have\ntherefore concluded, \u201cdirectly and immediately affects\nassociational rights.\u201d Dale, 530 U. S., at 659.\n   CLS would have us engage each line of cases independ\u00ad\nently, but its expressive-association and free-speech ar\u00ad\nguments merge: Who speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons,\ncolors what concept is conveyed. See Brief for Petitioner\n35 (expressive association in this case is \u201cthe functional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Our decisions make clear, and the parties agree, that Hastings,\n\nthrough its RSO program, established a limited public forum. See\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829\n(1995); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (counsel for CLS); Brief for Petitioner 25\u201326;\nBrief for Hastings 27\u201328; Brief for Hastings Outlaw 27.\n14   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nequivalent of speech itself\u201d). It therefore makes little\nsense to treat CLS\u2019s speech and association claims as\ndiscrete. See Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for\nFair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 300 (1981). In\u00ad\nstead, three observations lead us to conclude that our\nlimited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate\nframework for assessing both CLS\u2019s speech and associa\u00ad\ntion rights.\n    First, the same considerations that have led us to apply\na less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited\npublic forums as compared to other environments, see\nsupra, at 12\u201313, and n. 11, apply with equal force to ex\u00ad\npressive association occurring in limited public forums. As\njust noted, speech and expressive-association rights are\nclosely linked. See Roberts, 468 U. S., at 622 (Associa\u00ad\ntional freedom is \u201cimplicit in the right to engage in activi\u00ad\nties protected by the First Amendment.\u201d). When these\nintertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it\nwould be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive\nconstitutional review under our limited-public-forum test\nonly to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of\nexpressive association. Accord Brief for State Universities\nand State University Systems as Amici Curiae 37\u201338.\nThat result would be all the more anomalous in this case,\nfor CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim\nplays a part auxiliary to speech\u2019s starring role. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 18.\n    Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have\napplied in some settings to laws that burden expressive\nassociation would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining\ncharacteristic of limited public forums\u2014the State may\n\u201creserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829. See also Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 49\n(\u201cImplicit in the concept\u201d of a limited public forum is the\nState\u2019s \u201cright to make distinctions in access on the basis of\n. . . speaker identity.\u201d); Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 806 (\u201c[A]\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspeaker may be excluded from\u201d a limited public forum \u201cif\nhe is not a member of the class of speakers for whose\nespecial benefit the forum was created.\u201d).\n   An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools,\nincluding Hastings, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a, ordinar\u00ad\nily, and without controversy, limit official student-group\nrecognition to organizations comprising only students\u2014\neven if those groups wish to associate with nonstudents.\nSee, e.g., Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and\nGovernment Subsidies, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1919, 1940 (2006).\nThe same ground rules must govern both speech and\nassociation challenges in the limited-public-forum context,\nlest strict scrutiny trump a public university\u2019s ability to\n\u201cconfin[e] a [speech] forum to the limited and legitimate\npurposes for which it was created.\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829. See also Healy, 408 U. S., at 189 (\u201cAssocia\u00ad\ntional activities need not be tolerated where they infringe\nreasonable campus rules.\u201d).\n   Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited\u00ad\npublic-forum category, for CLS, in seeking what is effec\u00ad\ntively a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure to mod\u00ad\nify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person\nfor any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recogni\u00ad\ntion.13 The expressive-association precedents on which\nCLS relies, in contrast, involved regulations that com\npelled a group to include unwanted members, with no\nchoice to opt out. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U. S., at 648 (regula\u00ad\ntion \u201cforc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did]\nnot desire\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Roberts,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The fact that a university \u201cexpends funds to encourage a diversity\n\nof views from private speakers,\u201d this Court has held, does not justify it\nin \u201cdiscriminat[ing] based on the viewpoint of private persons whose\nspeech it facilitates.\u201d Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 834. Applying limited\u00ad\npublic-forum analysis (which itself prohibits viewpoint discrimination)\nto CLS\u2019s expressive association claim, we emphasize, does not upset\nthis principle.\n16    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n468 U. S., at 623 (\u201cThere can be no clearer example of\nan intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of\nan association than\u201d forced inclusion of unwelcome\nparticipants.). 14\n  In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished\nbetween policies that require action and those that with\u00ad\nhold benefits. See, e.g., Grove City College v. Bell, 465\nU. S. 555, 575\u2013576 (1984); Bob Jones Univ. v. United\nStates, 461 U. S. 574, 602\u2013604 (1983). Application of the\nless-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better ac\u00ad\ncounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO pro\u00ad\ngram, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the\nstick of prohibition. Cf. Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S.\n455, 463 (1973) (\u201cThat the Constitution may compel tol\u00ad\neration of private discrimination in some circumstances\ndoes not mean that it requires state support for such\ndiscrimination.\u201d).\n  In sum, we are persuaded that our limited-public-forum\nprecedents adequately respect both CLS\u2019s speech and\nexpressive-association rights, and fairly balance those\nrights against Hastings\u2019 interests as property owner and\neducational institution. We turn to the merits of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 CLS also brackets with expressive-association precedents our deci\u00ad\n\nsion in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of\nBoston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995). There, a veterans group sponsoring\na St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade challenged a state law requiring it to allow\ngay individuals to march in the parade behind a banner celebrating\ntheir Irish heritage and sexual orientation. Id., at 572. In evaluating\nthat challenge, the Hurley Court focused on the veterans group\u2019s\ninterest in controlling the message conveyed by the organization. See\nid., at 573\u2013581. Whether Hurley is best conceptualized as a speech or\nassociation case (or both), however, that precedent is of little help to\nCLS.      Hurley involved the application of a statewide public\u00ad\naccommodations law to the most traditional of public forums: the\nstreet. That context differs markedly from the limited public forum at\nissue here: a university\u2019s application of an all-comers policy to its\nstudent-organization program.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninstant dispute, therefore, with the limited-public-forum\ndecisions as our guide.\n                             B\n   As earlier pointed out, supra, at 1, 12\u201313, we do not\nwrite on a blank slate; we have three times before consid\u00ad\nered clashes between public universities and student\ngroups seeking official recognition or its attendant bene\u00ad\nfits. First, in Healy, a state college denied school affilia\u00ad\ntion to a student group that wished to form a local chapter\nof Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). 408 U. S., at\n170. Characterizing SDS\u2019s mission as violent and disrup\u00ad\ntive, and finding the organization\u2019s philosophy repugnant,\nthe college completely banned the SDS chapter from cam\u00ad\npus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication\nbetween students and the group, university officials went\nso far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a cam\u00ad\npus coffee shop. Id., at 174\u2013176. The college, we noted,\ncould require \u201cthat a group seeking official recognition\naffirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable\ncampus law,\u201d including \u201creasonable standards respecting\nconduct.\u201d Id., at 193. But a public educational institution\nexceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it \u201crestrict[s]\nspeech or association simply because it finds the views\nexpressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.\u201d Id., at 187\u2013188.15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 The dissent relies heavily on Healy, post, at 13\u201317, but its other\u00ad\n\nwise exhaustive account of the case elides the very fact the Healy Court\nidentified as dispositive: The president of the college explicitly denied\nthe student group official recognition because of the group\u2019s viewpoint.\nSee 408 U. S, at 187 (\u201cThe mere disagreement of the President with the\ngroup\u2019s philosophy affords no reason to deny it recognition.\u201d). In this\ncase, in contrast, Hastings denied CLS recognition not because the\nschool wanted to silence the \u201cviewpoint that CLS sought to express\nthrough its membership requirements,\u201d post, at 17, n. 2, but because\nCLS, insisting on preferential treatment, declined to comply with the\nopen-access policy applicable to all RSOs, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505\nU. S. 377, 390 (1992) (\u201cWhere the [State] does not target conduct on the\n18    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n   We later relied on Healy in Widmar. In that case, a\npublic university, in an effort to avoid state support for\nreligion, had closed its facilities to a registered student\ngroup that sought to use university space for religious\nworship and discussion. 454 U. S., at 264\u2013265. \u201cA univer\u00ad\nsity\u2019s mission is education,\u201d we observed, \u201cand decisions of\nthis Court have never denied a university\u2019s authority to\nimpose reasonable regulations compatible with that mis\u00ad\nsion upon the use of its campus and facilities.\u201d Id., at 268,\nn. 5. But because the university singled out religious\norganizations for disadvantageous treatment, we sub\u00ad\njected the university\u2019s regulation to strict scrutiny. Id., at\n269\u2013270. The school\u2019s interest \u201cin maintaining strict\nseparation of church and State,\u201d we held, was not \u201csuffi\u00ad\nciently compelling to justify . . . [viewpoint] discrimination\nagainst . . . religious speech.\u201d Id., at 270, 276 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, we\nreiterated that a university generally may not withhold\nbenefits from student groups because of their religious\noutlook. The officially recognized student group in Rosen\nberger was denied student-activity-fee funding to distrib\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbasis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regulation\nmerely because they express a discriminatory . . . philosophy.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). As discussed infra, at 28\u201331, Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is\nparadigmatically viewpoint neutral. The dissent\u2019s contention that \u201cthe\nidentity of the student group\u201d is the only \u201cway of distinguishing Healy,\u201d\npost, at 16, is thus untenable.\n   The dissent\u2019s description of Healy also omits the Healy Court\u2019s\nobservation that \u201c[a] college administration may . . . requir[e] . . . that a\ngroup seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to\nadhere to reasonable campus law. Such a requirement does not impose\nan impermissible condition on the students\u2019 associational rights. . . . It\nmerely constitutes an agreement to conform with reasonable standards\nrespecting conduct. . . . [T]he benefits of participation in the internal\nlife of the college community may be denied to any group that reserves\nthe right to violate any valid campus rules with which it disagrees.\u201d\n408 U.

By\n\u201cselect[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journal\u00ad\nistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\u201d we held,\nthe university had engaged in \u201cviewpoint discrimination,\nwhich is presumed impermissible when directed against\nspeech otherwise within the forum\u2019s limitations.\u201d Id., at\n831, 830.\n   In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had\nbeen unconstitutionally singled out because of their points\nof view. \u201cOnce it has opened a limited [public] forum,\u201d we\nemphasized, \u201cthe State must respect the lawful bounda\u00ad\nries it has itself set.\u201d Id., at 829.

See post, at 1, 15\u201316, 27. As noted supra, at 19\u201320, this\nCourt, exercising its independent judgment, must \u201cinterpre[t] and\nappl[y] . . . the right to free speech.\u201d Post, at 16. But determinations of\nwhat constitutes sound educational policy or what goals a student\u00ad\norganization forum ought to serve fall within the discretion of school\nadministrators and educators. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Hendrick\nHudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176,\n206 (1982).\n   17 Although the dissent maintains it is \u201ccontent to address the consti\u00ad\n\ntutionality of Hastings\u2019 actions under our limited public forum cases,\u201d\npost, at 17, it resists the import of those cases at every turn. For\nexample, although the dissent acknowledges that a university has the\nauthority to set the boundaries of a limited public forum, post, at 17, 24,\nthe dissent refuses to credit Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy as one of those\nboundaries. See ibid. (insisting that \u201cHastings\u2019 regulations . . . impose\nonly two substantive limitations: A group . . . must have student\nmembers and must be non-commercial.\u201d). In short, \u201cthe design of the\nRSO forum,\u201d post, at 26, which the dissent discusses at length, post, at\n24\u201331, is of its own tailoring.\n   Another example: The dissent pointedly observes that \u201c[w]hile there\ncan be no question that the State of California could not impose [an all\u00ad\ncomers] restrictio[n] on all religious groups in the State, the Court now\nholds that Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same\nrequirements on students who wish to participate in a forum that is\ndesigned to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.\u201d Post, at 27. As\nnoted supra, at 12\u201313, and n. 11, this difference reflects the lesser\nstandard of scrutiny applicable to limited public forums compared to\nother forums. The dissent fights the distinction between state prohibi\ntion and state support, but its real quarrel is with our limited public\nforum doctrine, which recognizes that distinction. CLS, it bears repeti\u00ad\ntion, remains free to express whatever it will, but it cannot insist on an\nexemption from Hastings\u2019 embracive all-comers policy.\n22    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

RSOs,\nwe count it significant, are eligible for financial assist-\nance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see\nsupra, at 3; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings\nstudent is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a\nmember.18\n  Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings\npolice the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy\nwithout inquiring into an RSO\u2019s motivation for member\u00ad\nship restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS\u2019s\nview of the Constitution\u2019s limits, CLS proposes that Hast\u00ad\nings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimi\u00ad\nnation due to status. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But that\nproposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor.\nHow should the Law School go about determining whether\na student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion\nin belief-based garb? If a hypothetical Male-Superiority\nClub barred a female student from running for its presi\u00ad\ndency, for example, how could the Law School tell whether\nthe group rejected her bid because of her sex or because,\nby seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief\nin its fundamental philosophy?\n  This case itself is instructive in this regard. CLS con\u00ad\ntends that it does not exclude individuals because of sex\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 CLS notes that its \u201cactivities\u2014its Bible studies, speakers, and din\u00ad\n\nners\u2014are open to all students,\u201d even if attendees are barred from\nmembership and leadership.

But so long as\na public university does not contravene constitutional\nlimits, its choice to advance state-law goals through the\nschool\u2019s educational endeavors stands on firm footing.\n  In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in\nsupport of its all-comers requirement are surely reason\u00ad\nable in light of the RSO forum\u2019s purposes.20\n                               3\n   The Law School\u2019s policy is all the more creditworthy in\nview of the \u201csubstantial alternative channels that remain\nopen for [CLS-student] communication to take place.\u201d\nPerry Ed.

This catchphrase\nconfuses CLS\u2019s preferred policy with constitutional limita\u00ad\ntion\u2014the advisability of Hastings\u2019 policy does not control\nits permissibility. See Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,\n326 (1975). Instead, we have repeatedly stressed that a\nState\u2019s restriction on access to a limited public forum\n\u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable\nlimitation.\u201d Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808.22\n    CLS also assails the reasonableness of the all-comers\npolicy in light of the RSO forum\u2019s function by forecasting\nthat the policy will facilitate hostile takeovers; if organiza\u00ad\ntions must open their arms to all, CLS contends, saboteurs\nwill infiltrate groups to subvert their mission and mes\u00ad\nsage. This supposition strikes us as more hypothetical\nthan real. CLS points to no history or prospect of RSO\u00ad\nhijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts\nv. Finley, 524 U.

In the 2004\u20132005 academic year, approximately\n60 student organizations, representing a variety of interests, registered\nwith Hastings, from the Clara Foltz Feminist Association, to the\nEnvironmental Law Society, to the Hastings Chinese Law and Culture\nSociety.

And if a rogue\nstudent intent on sabotaging an organization\u2019s objectives\nnevertheless attempted a takeover, the members of that\ngroup would not likely elect her as an officer.\n   RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy,\nmay condition eligibility for membership and leadership\non attendance, the payment of dues, or other neutral\nrequirements designed to ensure that students join be\u00ad\ncause of their commitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its\ndemise. See supra, at 4, n. 2. Several RSOs at Hastings\nlimit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this\nway. See, e.g., App. 192 (members must \u201c[p]ay their dues\non a timely basis\u201d and \u201cattend meetings regularly\u201d); id., at\n173 (members must complete an application and pay dues;\n\u201c[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly\nscheduled meetings shall be dropped from rolls\u201d); App. to\nPet. for Cert. 129a (\u201cOnly Hastings students who have\nheld membership in this organization for a minimum of\none semester shall be eligible to be an officer.\u201d).23\n   Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more\nfrom its law students than the disruptive behavior CLS\nhypothesizes\u2014and to build this expectation into its educa\u00ad\ntional approach. A reasonable policy need not anticipate\nand preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance\nor manipulation. If students begin to exploit an all-comers\npolicy by hijacking organizations to distort or destroy their\nmissions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise\nits policy.

CLS\u2019s analytical error lies in\nfocusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignoring the\ninterests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all,\nhas two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a\ngroup\u2019s desire to exclude and students\u2019 demand for equal\naccess, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting\nall organizations to express what they wish but no group\nto discriminate in membership.24\n                          D\n  We next consider whether Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is\nviewpoint neutral.\n                             1\n  Although this aspect of limited-public-forum analysis\nhas been the constitutional sticking point in our prior\ndecisions, as earlier recounted, supra, at 17\u201319, we need\nnot dwell on it here. It is, after all, hard to imagine a\nmore viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring all\nstudent groups to accept all comers. In contrast to Healy,\nWidmar, and Rosenberger, in which universities singled\nout organizations for disfavored treatment because of their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 In arguing that the all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of\n\nthe RSO forum\u2019s purposes, the dissent notes that Title VII, which\nprohibits employment discrimination on the basis of religion, among\nother categories, provides an exception for religious associations. Post,\nat 28, n. 8. The question here, however, is not whether Hastings could,\nconsistent with the Constitution, provide religious groups dispensation\nfrom the all-comers policy by permitting them to restrict membership to\nthose who share their faith. It is instead whether Hastings must grant\nthat exemption. This Court\u2019s decision in Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.

Finding the political and\nideological speech of certain groups offensive, the student-challengers\nargued that imposition of the fee violated their First Amendment\nrights. 529 U. S., at 221.

Id., at 235. In this case, in contrast, the all\u00ad\ncomers policy governs all RSOs; Hastings does not pick and choose\nwhich organizations must comply with the policy on the basis of view\u00ad\npoint.

I join its opinion\nwithout reservation. Because the dissent has volunteered\nan argument that the school\u2019s general Nondiscrimination\nPolicy would be \u201cplainly\u201d unconstitutional if applied to this\ncase, post, at 18 (opinion of ALITO, J.), a brief response\nis appropriate. In my view, both policies are plainly\nlegitimate.\n  The Hastings College of Law\u2019s (Hastings) Nondiscrimi\nnation Policy contains boilerplate language used by insti\ntutions and workplaces across the country: It prohibits\n\u201cunlawfu[l]\u201d discrimination \u201con the basis of race, color,\nreligion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or\nsexual orientation.\u201d App. 220. Petitioner, the Hastings\nchapter of the Christian Legal Society (CLS), refused to\ncomply.

CLS, in short, wanted to receive the\nschool\u2019s formal recognition\u2014and the benefits that attend\n2     CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., \n\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

There are nu\nmerous reasons why this counterintuitive theory is\nunsound. Although the First Amendment may protect\nCLS\u2019s discriminatory practices off campus, it does not\nrequire a public university to validate or support them.\n   As written, the Nondiscrimination Policy is content and\nviewpoint neutral. It does not reflect a judgment by school\nofficials about the substance of any student group\u2019s\nspeech. Nor does it exclude any would-be groups on the\nbasis of their convictions. Indeed, it does not regulate\nexpression or belief at all. The policy is \u201cdirected at the\norganization\u2019s activities rather than its philosophy,\u201d Healy\nv. James, 408 U. S. 169, 188 (1972). Those who hold reli\ngious beliefs are not \u201csingled out,\u201d post, at 19 (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting); those who engage in discriminatory conduct\nbased on someone else\u2019s religious status and belief are\nsingled out.1 Regardless of whether they are the product\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent appears to accept that Hastings may prohibit discrimi\n\nnation on the basis of religious status, though it rejects the notion that\nHastings may do the same for religious belief. See, e.g., post, at 22, n. 5,\n28. If CLS sought to exclude a Muslim student in virtue of the fact that\nhe \u201cis\u201d Muslim, the dissent suggests, there would be no problem in\nHastings forbidding that. But if CLS sought to exclude the same\nstudent in virtue of the fact that he subscribes to the Muslim faith,\nHastings must stand idly by. This proposition is not only unworkable\nin practice but also flawed in conception. A person\u2019s religion often\nsimultaneously constitutes or informs a status, an identity, a set of\nbeliefs and practices, and much else besides. (So does sexual orienta\ntion for that matter, see ante, at 22\u201323, notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s\nview that a rule excluding those who engage in \u201cunrepentant homosex\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

There is,\nmoreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because\nof any reason related to the particular views that religious\nindividuals or groups might have, much less because of a\ndesire to suppress or distort those views. The policy\u2019s\nreligion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to un\ndermine, religious freedom.\n   To be sure, the policy may end up having greater conse\nquence for religious groups\u2014whether and to what extent\nit will is far from clear ex ante\u2014inasmuch as they are\nmore likely than their secular counterparts to wish to\nexclude students of particular faiths. But there is likewise\nno evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to\nreligious groups, or that it has in practice caused signifi\ncant harm to their operations. And it is a basic tenet of\nFirst Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in\nitself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.2 The dissent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nual conduct,\u201d App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or\nidentity, post, at 22\u201323.) Our First Amendment doctrine has never\nrequired university administrators to undertake the impossible task of\nseparating out belief-based from status-based religious discrimination.\n   2 See, e.g., Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 763\n\n(1994); R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385 (1992); Board of Directors\nof Rotary Int\u2019l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.

Courts and commen\ntators have applied this insight to the exact situation posed by the\nNondiscrimination Policy. See, e.g., Christian Legal Society v.

MARTINEZ \n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring\n\n\nhas thus given no reason to be skeptical of the basic\ndesign, function, or rationale of the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy.\n  What the policy does reflect is a judgment that dis\ncrimination by school officials or organizations on the\nbasis of certain factors, such as race and religion, is less\ntolerable than discrimination on the basis of other factors.\nThis approach may or may not be the wisest choice in the\ncontext of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) pro\ngram. But it is at least a reasonable choice. Academic\nadministrators routinely employ antidiscrimination rules\nto promote tolerance, understanding, and respect, and to\nsafeguard students from invidious forms of discrimination,\nincluding sexual orientation discrimination.3 Applied to\nthe RSO context, these values can, in turn, advance nu\nmerous pedagogical objectives.         See post, at 3\u20134\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n  It is critical, in evaluating CLS\u2019s challenge to the Non\ndiscrimination Policy, to keep in mind that an RSO pro\ngram is a limited forum\u2014the boundaries of which may be\ndelimited by the proprietor. When a religious association,\nor a secular association, operates in a wholly public set\nting, it must be allowed broad freedom to control its mem\nbership and its message, even if its decisions cause offense\nto outsiders. Profound constitutional problems would\narise if the State of California tried to \u201cdemand that all\nChristian groups admit members who believe that Jesus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 In a case about an antidiscrimination policy that, even if ill-advised,\n\nis explicitly directed at preventing religious discrimination, it is rather\nhard to swallow the dissent\u2019s ominous closing remarks. See post, at 37\n(suggesting that today\u2019s decision \u201cpoint[s] a judicial dagger at the heart\nof\u201d religious groups in the United States (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Although the dissent is willing to see pernicious antireligi\nous motives and implications where there are none, it does not seem\ntroubled by the fact that religious sects, unfortunately, are not the only\nsocial groups who have been persecuted throughout history simply for\nbeing who they are.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Hastings College of Law\nis not a legislature. And no state actor has demanded that\nanyone do anything outside the confines of a discrete,\nvoluntary academic program. Although it may be the case\nthat to some \u201cuniversity students, the campus is their\nworld,\u201d post, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it\ndoes not follow that the campus ought to be equated with\nthe public square.\n   The campus is, in fact, a world apart from the public\nsquare in numerous respects, and religious organizations,\nas well as all other organizations, must abide by certain\nnorms of conduct when they enter an academic commu\nnity. Public universities serve a distinctive role in a mod\nern democratic society. Like all specialized government\nentities, they must make countless decisions about how to\nallocate resources in pursuit of their role. Some of those\ndecisions will be controversial; many will have differential\neffects across populations; virtually all will entail value\njudgments of some kind. As a general matter, courts\nshould respect universities\u2019 judgments and let them man\nage their own affairs.\n   The RSO forum is no different. It is not an open com\nmons that Hastings happens to maintain. It is a mecha\nnism through which Hastings confers certain benefits and\npursues certain aspects of its educational mission. Having\nexercised its discretion to establish an RSO program, a\nuniversity must treat all participants evenhandedly. But\nthe university need not remain neutral\u2014indeed it could\nnot remain neutral\u2014in determining which goals the pro\ngram will serve and which rules are best suited to facili\ntate those goals. These are not legal questions but policy\nquestions; they are not for the Court but for the university\nto make. When any given group refuses to comply with\n6    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews,\nblacks, and women\u2014or those who do not share their con\ntempt for Jews, blacks, and women. A free society must\ntolerate such groups.

When the gov\nernment does exclude from a limited forum, however,\nother content-based judgments may be impermissible. For\ninstance, an otherwise qualified and relevant speaker may\nnot be excluded because of hostility to his or her views or\nbeliefs. See Healy v. James, 408 U.

S. 819 (1995), the essential purpose of the limited\nforum was to facilitate the expression of differing views in\nthe context of student publications. The forum was lim\nited because it was confined: first, to student-run groups;\nand second, to publications. The forum was created in the\nlong tradition of using newspapers and other publications\nto express differing views and also in the honored tradi\ntion of a university setting that stimulates the free ex\nchange of ideas.

These considera\ntions supported the Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the\nFirst Amendment, a limited forum for student-run publi\ncations did not permit the exclusion of a paper for the\nreason that it was devoted to expressing religious views.\n   Rosenberger is distinguishable from the instant case in\nvarious respects. Not least is that here the school policy in\nquestion is not content based either in its formulation or\nevident purpose; and were it shown to be otherwise, the\ncase likely should have a different outcome. Here, the\npolicy applies equally to all groups and views. And, given\nthe stipulation of the parties, there is no basis for an\nallegation that the design or purpose of the rule was, by\nsubterfuge, to discriminate based on viewpoint.\n   An objection might be that the all-comers policy, even if\nnot so designed or intended, in fact makes it difficult for\ncertain groups to express their views in a manner essen\ntial to their message. A group that can limit membership\nto those who agree in full with its aims and purposes may\nbe more effective in delivering its message or furthering\nits expressive objectives; and the Court has recognized\nthat this interest can be protected against governmental\ninterference or regulation. See Boy Scouts of America v.\nDale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000).

See id., at 233. Stu\ndents may be shaped as profoundly by their peers as by\ntheir teachers. Extracurricular activities, such as those in\nthe Hastings \u201cRegistered Student Organization\u201d program,\nfacilitate interactions between students, enabling them to\nexplore new points of view, to develop interests and tal\nents, and to nurture a growing sense of self.

A vibrant dialogue is not possible if\nstudents wall themselves off from opposing points of view.\n   The school\u2019s objectives thus might not be well served if,\nas a condition to membership or participation in a group,\nstudents were required to avow particular personal beliefs\nor to disclose private, off-campus behavior. Students\nwhose views are in the minority at the school would likely\nfare worse in that regime. Indeed, were those sorts of\nrequirements to become prevalent, it might undermine the\nprinciple that in a university community\u2014and in a law\nschool community specifically\u2014speech is deemed persua\nsive based on its substance, not the identity of the\nspeaker. The era of loyalty oaths is behind us. A school\nquite properly may conclude that allowing an oath or\nbelief-affirming requirement, or an outside conduct re\nquirement, could be divisive for student relations and\ninconsistent with the basic concept that a view\u2019s validity\nshould be tested through free and open discussion. The\nschool\u2019s policy therefore represents a permissible effort to\npreserve the value of its forum.\n   In addition to a circumstance, already noted, in which it\ncould be demonstrated that a school has adopted or en\nforced its policy with the intent or purpose of discriminat\ning or disadvantaging a group on account of its views,\npetitioner also would have a substantial case on the merits\nif it were shown that the all-comers policy was either\ndesigned or used to infiltrate the group or challenge its\nleadership in order to stifle its views. But that has not\nbeen shown to be so likely or self-evident as a matter of\ngroup dynamics in this setting that the Court can declare\nthe school policy void without more facts; and if there were\na showing that in a particular case the purpose or effect of\nthe policy was to stifle speech or make it ineffective, that,\ntoo, would present a case different from the one before us.\n   These observations are offered to support the analysis\nset forth in the opinion of the Court, which I join.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court does not address the constitutionality of\nthe very different policy that Hastings invoked when it\ndenied CLS\u2019s application for registration. Nor does the\nCourt address the constitutionality of the policy that\nHastings now purports to follow. And the Court ignores\nstrong evidence that the accept-all-comers policy is not\nviewpoint neutral because it was announced as a pretext\nto justify viewpoint discrimination. Brushing aside incon\nvenient precedent, the Court arms public educational\ninstitutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the\nspeech of unpopular groups\u2014groups to which, as Hastings\ncandidly puts it, these institutions \u201cdo not wish to . . . lend\ntheir name[s].\u201d Brief for Respondent Hastings College of\nLaw 11; see also id., at 35.\n                              I\n  The Court provides a misleading portrayal of this case.\nAs related by the Court, (1) Hastings, for the past 20\nyears, has required any student group seeking registration\nto admit any student who wishes to join, ante, at 5; (2) the\neffects of Hastings\u2019 refusal to register CLS have been of\nquestionable importance, see ante, at 24\u201325; and (3) this\ncase is about CLS\u2019s desire to obtain \u201ca state subsidy,\u201d ante,\nat 15.

Overwhelming\nevidence, however, shows that Hastings denied CLS\u2019s\napplication pursuant to the Nondiscrimination Policy and\nthat the accept-all-comers policy was nowhere to be found\nuntil it was mentioned by a former dean in a deposition\ntaken well after this case began.\n   The events that gave rise to this litigation began in\n2004, when a small group of Hastings students sought to\nregister a Hastings chapter of CLS, a national organiza\ntion of Christian lawyers and law students. All CLS\nmembers must sign a Statement of Faith affirming belief\nin fundamental Christian doctrines, including the belief\nthat the Bible is \u201cthe inspired Word of God.\u201d App. 226. In\nearly 2004, the national organization adopted a resolution\nstating that \u201c[i]n view of the clear dictates of Scripture,\nunrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually\nimmoral lifestyle is inconsistent with an affirmation of the\nStatement of Faith, and consequently may be regarded by\nCLS as disqualifying such an individual from CLS mem\nbership.\u201d Id., at 146. The resolution made it clear that \u201ca\nsexually immoral lifestyle,\u201d in CLS\u2019s view, includes engag\ning in \u201cacts of sexual conduct outside of God\u2019s design for\nmarriage between one man and one woman.\u201d Ibid. It was\nshortly after this resolution was passed that the Hastings\nchapter of CLS applied to register with the law school.\n   Hastings sponsors an active program of \u201cregistered\nstudent organizations\u201d (RSOs) pursuant to the law school\u2019s\navowed responsibility to \u201censure an opportunity for the\nexpression of a variety of viewpoints\u201d and promote \u201cthe\nhighest standards of . . . freedom of expression,\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 82a, 74a.

See App. 236\u2013245; Brief for\nPetitioner 3\u20134.\n   Not surprisingly many of these registered groups were\nand are dedicated to expressing a message. For example,\nSilenced Right, a pro-life group, taught that \u201call human\nlife from the moment of conception until natural death is\nsacred and has inherent dignity,\u201d id., at 244, while Law\nStudents for Choice aimed to \u201cdefend and expand repro\nductive rights,\u201d id., at 243.

As far as the record re\nflects, Ms. Chapman made no mention of an accept-all\napplicants policy.\n   A few days later, three officers of the chapter met with\nMs. Chapman, and she reiterated that the CLS bylaws did\nnot comply with \u201cthe religion and sexual orientation provi\nsions of the Nondiscrimination Policy and that they would\nneed to be amended in order for CLS to become a regis\ntered student organization.\u201d Id., at 228. About a week\nlater, Hastings sent CLS a letter to the same effect. Id., at\n228\u2013229, 293\u2013295. On both of these occasions, it appears\nthat not a word was said about an accept-all-comers\npolicy.\n   When CLS refused to change its membership require\nments, Hastings denied its request for registration\u2014thus\nmaking CLS the only student group whose application for\nregistration has ever been rejected.

In response, Hastings\nadmitted that its Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cpermits politi\ncal, social, and cultural student organizations to select\nofficers and members who are dedicated to a particular set\nof ideals or beliefs.\u201d Id., at 93. The Court states that\n\u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it\nrelates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all\ncomers.\u201d Ante, at 4. But this admission in Hastings\u2019\nanswer shows that Hastings had not adopted this inter\npretation when its answer was filed.\n   Within a few months, however, Hastings\u2019 position\nchanged. In July 2005, Mary Kay Kane, then the dean of\nthe law school, was deposed, and she stated: \u201cIt is my view\nthat in order to be a registered student organization you\nhave to allow all of our students to be members and full\nparticipants if they want to.\u201d App. 343. In a declaration\nfiled in October 2005, Ms. Chapman provided a more\ndeveloped explanation, stating: \u201cHastings interprets the\nNondiscrimination Policy as requiring that student or\nganizations wishing to register with Hastings allow any\nHastings student to become a member and/or seek a lead\nership position in the organization.\u201d Id., at 349.\n   Hastings claims that this accept-all-comers policy has\nexisted since 1990 but points to no evidence that the policy\nwas ever put in writing or brought to the attention of\nmembers of the law school community prior to the dean\u2019s\ndeposition. Indeed, Hastings has adduced no evidence of\nthe policy\u2019s existence before that date. And while Dean\nKane and Ms. Chapman stated, well after this litigation\nhad begun, that Hastings had such a policy, neither they\nnor any other Hastings official has ever stated in a deposi\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

First, the two policies\nare simply not the same: The Nondiscrimination Policy\nproscribes discrimination on a limited number of specified\ngrounds, while the accept-all-comers policy outlaws all\nselectivity. Second, the Nondiscrimination Policy applies\nto everything that Hastings does, and the law school does\nnot follow an accept-all-comers policy in activities such as\nadmitting students and hiring faculty.\n   In an effort to circumvent this problem, the Court writes\nthat \u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as\nit relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all\ncomers.\u201d Ante, at 4 (emphasis added). This puts Hastings\nin the implausible position of maintaining that the Non\ndiscrimination Policy means one thing as applied to the\nRSO program and something quite different as applied to\nall of Hastings\u2019 other activities. But the Nondiscrimina\ntion Policy by its terms applies fully to all components of\nthe law school, \u201cincluding administration [and] faculty.\u201d\nApp. 220.\n   Third, the record is replete with evidence that, at least\nuntil Dean Kane unveiled the accept-all-comers policy in\nJuly 2005, Hastings routinely registered student groups\nwith bylaws limiting membership and leadership positions\nto those who agreed with the groups\u2019 viewpoints. For\nexample, the bylaws of the Hastings Democratic Caucus\nprovided that \u201cany full-time student at Hastings may\nbecome a member of HDC so long as they do not exhibit a\nconsistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of\nthe organization as stated in Article 3, Section 1.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 118a (emphasis added).

Since Hastings requires any\nstudent group applying for registration to submit a copy of\nits bylaws, see id., at 249\u2013250, Hastings cannot claim that\nit was unaware of such provisions. And as noted, CLS was\ndenied registration precisely because Ms. Chapman re\nviewed its bylaws and found them unacceptable.\n   We are told that, when CLS pointed out these discrep\nancies during this litigation, Hastings took action to en\nsure that student groups were in fact complying with the\nlaw school\u2019s newly disclosed accept-all-comers policy. For\nexample, Hastings asked La Raza to revise its bylaws to\nallow all students to become voting members. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 66a. See also Brief for State of Michigan et al. as\nAmici Curiae 2, n. 1 (relating anecdotally that Hastings\nrecently notified the Hastings Democrats that \u201cto main\ntain the Club\u2019s standing as a student organization,\u201d it\nmust \u201copen its membership to all students, regardless of\nparty affiliation\u201d). These belated remedial efforts suggest,\nif anything, that Hastings had no accept-all-comers policy\nuntil this litigation was well under way.\n   Finally, when Hastings filed its brief in this Court, its\npolicy, which had already evolved from a policy prohibiting\ncertain specified forms of discrimination into an accept-all\ncomers policy, underwent yet another transformation.\nNow, Hastings claims that it does not really have an\naccept-all-comers policy; it has an accept-some-comers\npolicy.

What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation\nfiled in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all\ncomers policy. CLS did not stipulate that its application\nhad been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such\na policy. On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that\nthe reason repeatedly given by Hasting at that time was\nthat the CLS bylaws did not comply with the Nondis\ncrimination Policy. See App. 228\u2013229. Indeed, the parties\ndid not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy\nexisted in the fall of 2004.

As noted above, Hastings admitted in its\nanswer, which was filed prior to the former dean\u2019s deposi\ntion, that at least as of that time, the law school did not\nfollow an accept-all-comers policy and instead allowed\n\u201cpolitical, social, and cultural student organizations to\nselect officers and members who are dedicated to a par\nticular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93.\n                              B\n   The Court also distorts the record with respect to the\neffect on CLS of Hastings\u2019 decision to deny registration.\nThe Court quotes a letter written by Hastings\u2019 general\ncounsel in which she stated that Hastings \u201c \u2018would be\npleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for\nits meetings and activities.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting App.\n294). Later in its opinion, the Court reiterates that \u201cHast\nings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct\nmeetings,\u201d ante, at 24, but the majority does not mention\nthat this offer was subject to important qualifications. As\nHastings\u2019 attorney put it in the District Court, Hastings\ntold CLS: \u201c \u2018Hastings allows community groups to some\ndegree to use its facilities, sometimes on a pay basis, I\nunderstand, if they\u2019re available after priority is given to\nregistered organizations\u2019. We offered that.\u201d App. 442.\n   The Court also fails to mention what happened when\nCLS attempted to take advantage of Hastings\u2019 offer. On\nAugust 19, 2005, the local CLS president sent an e-mail to\n12   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

Id., at 298. This request\u2014\nmerely to set up a table on a patio\u2014could hardly have\ninterfered with any other use of the law school\u2019s premises\nor cost the school any money. But although the request\nwas labeled \u201ctime sensitive,\u201d ibid., Ms. Chapman did not\nrespond until the dates in question had passed, and she\nthen advised the student that all further inquiries should\nbe made through CLS\u2019s attorney. Id., at 297\u2013298.\n   In September 2005, CLS tried again. Through counsel,\nCLS sought to reserve a room on campus for a guest\nspeaker who was scheduled to appear on a specified date.\nId., at 302\u2013303. Noting Ms. Chapman\u2019s tardy response on\nthe prior occasion, the attorney asked to receive a re\nsponse before the scheduled date, but once again no an\nswer was given until after the date had passed. Id., at\n300.\n   Other statements in the majority opinion make it seem\nas if the denial of registration did not hurt CLS at all. The\nCourt notes that CLS was able to hold Bible-study meet\nings and other events. Ante, at 6. And \u201c[a]lthough CLS\ncould not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of com\nmunication,\u201d the Court states, \u201cthe advent of electronic\nmedia and social-networking sites reduces the importance\nof those channels.\u201d Ante, at 24.\n   At the beginning of the 2005 school year, the Hastings\nCLS group had seven members, App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a,\nso there can be no suggestion that the group flourished.\nAnd since one of CLS\u2019s principal claims is that it was\nsubjected to discrimination based on its viewpoint, the\nmajority\u2019s emphasis on CLS\u2019s ability to endure that dis\ncrimination\u2014by using private facilities and means of\ncommunication\u2014is quite amazing.\n   This Court does not customarily brush aside a claim of\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

We\nhave never before taken the view that a little viewpoint\ndiscrimination is acceptable. Nor have we taken this\napproach in other discrimination cases.\n                               C\n   Finally, I must comment on the majority\u2019s emphasis on\nfunding. According to the majority, CLS is \u201cseeking what\nis effectively a state subsidy,\u201d ante, at 15, and the question\npresented in this case centers on the \u201cuse of school funds,\u201d\nante, at 1. In fact, funding plays a very small role in this\ncase. Most of what CLS sought and was denied\u2014such as\npermission to set up a table on the law school patio\u2014\nwould have been virtually cost free. If every such activity\nis regarded as a matter of funding, the First Amendment\nrights of students at public universities will be at the\nmercy of the administration. As CLS notes, \u201c[t]o univer\nsity students, the campus is their world. The right to\nmeet on campus and use campus channels of communica\ntion is at least as important to university students as the\nright to gather on the town square and use local communi\ncation forums is to the citizen.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n13.\n                             II\n  To appreciate how far the Court has strayed, it is in\nstructive to compare this case with Healy v. James, 408\nU. S. 169 (1972), our only First Amendment precedent\ninvolving a public college\u2019s refusal to recognize a student\ngroup. The group in Healy was a local chapter of the\nStudents for a Democratic Society (SDS). When the stu\ndents who applied for recognition of the chapter were\nasked by a college committee whether they would \u201c \u2018re\nspond to issues of violence as other S.D.S. chapters have,\u2019 \u201d\ntheir answer was that their \u201c \u2018action would have to be\n14   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

They simi\nlarly refused to provide a definitive answer when asked\nwhether they would be willing to \u201cuse any means possible\u201d\nto achieve their aims. Id., at 173. The president of the\ncollege refused to allow the group to be recognized, con\ncluding that the philosophy of the SDS was \u201cantithetical to\nthe school\u2019s policies\u201d and that it was doubtful that the\nlocal chapter was independent of the national organiza\ntion, the \u201c \u2018published aims and philosophy\u2019 \u201d of which in\ncluded \u201c \u2018disruption and violence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 174\u2013175, and\nn. 4.\n   The effects of nonrecognition in Healy were largely the\nsame as those present here. The SDS was denied the use\nof campus facilities, as well as access to the customary\nmeans used for communication among the members of the\ncollege community. Id., at 176, 181\u2013182.\n   The lower federal courts held that the First Amendment\nrights of the SDS chapter had not been violated, and when\nthe case reached this Court, the college, much like today\u2019s\nmajority, sought to minimize the effects of nonrecognition,\narguing that the SDS members \u201cstill may meet as a group\noff campus, that they still may distribute written material\noff campus, and that they still may meet together infor\nmally on campus . . . as individuals.\u201d Id., at 182\u2013183.\n   This Court took a different view. The Court held that\nthe denial of recognition substantially burdened the stu\ndents\u2019 right to freedom of association. After observing that\n\u201c[t]he primary impediment to free association flowing from\nnonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for\nmeetings and other appropriate purposes,\u201d id., at 181, the\nCourt continued:\n        \u201cPetitioners\u2019 associational interests also were cir\n     cumscribed by the denial of the use of campus bulletin\n     boards and the school newspaper.

Moreover, the organization\u2019s ability to partici\n    pate in the intellectual give and take of campus de\n    bate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by\n    denial of access to the customary media for communi\n    cating with the administration, faculty members, and\n    other students. Such impediments cannot be viewed\n    as insubstantial.\u201d Id., at 181\u2013182.\n   It is striking that all of these same burdens are now\nborne by CLS. CLS is prevented from using campus facili\nties\u2014unless at some future time Hastings chooses to\nprovide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the\ngroup, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set\nup a table on the patio or to use a room that would other\nwise be unoccupied. And CLS, like the SDS in Healy, has\nbeen cut off from \u201cthe customary media for communicating\nwith the administration, faculty members, and other\nstudents.\u201d Id., at 181\u2013182.\n   It is also telling that the Healy Court, unlike today\u2019s\nmajority, refused to defer to the college president\u2019s judg\nment regarding the compatibility of \u201csound educational\npolicy\u201d and free speech rights. The same deference argu\nments that the majority now accepts were made in defense\nof the college president\u2019s decision to deny recognition in\nHealy. Respondents in that case emphasized that the\ncollege president, not the courts, had the responsibility of\nadministering the institution and that the courts should\nallow him \u201c \u2018wide discretion . . . in determining what ac\ntions are most compatible with its educational objectives.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondents in Healy v.

Unlike the\nCourt today, the Healy Court emphatically rejected the\nproposition that \u201cFirst Amendment protections should\napply with less force on college campuses than in the\ncommunity at large.\u201d 408 U. S., at 180. And on one key\nquestion after another\u2014whether the local SDS chapter\nwas independent of the national organization, whether the\ngroup posed a substantial threat of material disruption,\nand whether the students\u2019 responses to the committee\u2019s\nquestions about violence and disruption signified a will\ningness to engage in such activities\u2014the Court drew\nits own conclusions, which differed from the college\npresident\u2019s.\n   The Healy Court was true to the principle that when it\ncomes to the interpretation and application of the right to\nfree speech, we exercise our own independent judgment.\nWe do not defer to Congress on such matters, see Sable\nCommunications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 129\n(1989), and there is no reason why we should bow to uni\nversity administrators.\n   In the end, I see only two possible distinctions between\nHealy and the present case. The first is that Healy did not\ninvolve any funding, but as I have noted, funding plays\nonly a small part in this case. And if Healy would other\nwise prevent Hastings from refusing to register CLS, I see\nno good reason why the potential availability of funding\nshould enable Hastings to deny all of the other rights that\ngo with registration.\n   This leaves just one way of distinguishing Healy: the\nidentity of the student group. In Healy, the Court warned\nthat the college president\u2019s views regarding the philosophy\nof the SDS could not \u201cjustify the denial of First Amend\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Here, too, disapproval of\nCLS cannot justify Hastings\u2019 actions.2\n                               III\n   The Court pays little attention to Healy and instead\nfocuses solely on the question whether Hastings\u2019 registra\ntion policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited\npublic forum. While I think that Healy is largely control\nling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hast\nings\u2019 actions under our limited public forum cases, which\nlead to exactly the same conclusion.\n   In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program.\nOnce a public university opens a limited public forum, it\n\u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819, 829 (1995). The university \u201cmay not exclude\nspeech where its distinction is not \u2018reasonable in light of\nthe purpose served by the forum.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Corne\nlius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.\n788, 806 (1985)). And the university must maintain strict\nviewpoint neutrality. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\nSystem v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 234 (2000); Rosen\nberger, supra, at 829.\n   This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the\nexpression of religious viewpoints. In an unbroken line of\ndecisions analyzing private religious speech in limited\npublic forums, we have made it perfectly clear that\n\u201c[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court attempts to distinguish Healy on the ground that there\n\nthe college \u201cexplicitly denied the student group official recognition\nbecause of the group\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 15. The same, how\never, is true here. CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimi\nnation Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express\nthrough its membership requirements. See supra, at 5; infra, at 18\u201323.\nAnd there is strong evidence that Hastings abruptly shifted from the\nNondiscrimination Policy to the accept-all-comers policy as a pretext for\nviewpoint discrimination. See infra, at 31\u201335.\n18    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nGood News Club v.

We\nhave also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited\npublic forum are particularly important in the university\nsetting, where \u201cthe State acts against a background of\ntradition of thought and experiment that is at the center\nof our intellectual and philosophic tradition.\u201d Rosenberger,\nsupra, at 835.\n                             IV\n  Analyzed under this framework, Hastings\u2019 refusal to\nregister CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy\nplainly fails.3 As previously noted, when Hastings refused\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitu\n\ntional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. See App. 80.\nParticularly in light of Hastings\u2019 practice of changing its announced\npolicies, these requests are not moot. It is well settled that the volun\ntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in\nwhich the legality of that conduct is challenged. See City of Mesquite v.\nAladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982); see also Allee v.\nMedrano, 416 U. S. 802, 810\u2013811 (1974); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416\nU.

The First Amendment protects the right of\n\u201c \u2018expressive association\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe right to associate\nfor the purpose of speaking.\u201d Rumsfeld v.

And the Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group in\nfringes the group\u2019s freedom of expressive association if the\npresence of that person affects in a significant way the\ngroup\u2019s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d\nDale, supra, at 648.\n    With one important exception, the Hastings Nondis\ncrimination Policy respected that right. As Hastings\nstated in its answer, the Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cper\nmit[ted] political, social, and cultural student organiza\ntions to select officers and members who are dedicated to a\nparticular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93. But the policy\nsingled out one category of expressive associations for\ndisfavored treatment: groups formed to express a religious\nmessage. Only religious groups were required to admit\nstudents who did not share their views. An environmen\ntalist group was not required to admit students who re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndiscrimination Policy are not moot. If, as the Court assumes, the\nparties stipulated that the only relevant policy is the accept-all-comers\npolicy, then the District Court should not have addressed the constitu\ntionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy. But the District Court\napproved both policies, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judg\nment. That judgment remains binding on CLS, so it is only appropriate\nthat CLS be permitted to challenge that determination now. The\nquestion of the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy falls\ncomfortably within the question presented, and CLS raised that issue\nin its brief.

It is no wonder that the\nCourt makes no attempt to defend the constitutionality of\nthe Nondiscrimination Policy.\n   Unlike the Court, JUSTICE STEVENS attempts a defense,\ncontending that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint\nneutral. But his arguments are squarely contrary to\nestablished precedent.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS first argues that the Nondiscrimina\ntion Policy is viewpoint neutral because it \u201cdoes not regu\nlate expression or belief at all\u201d but instead regulates con\nduct. See ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). This Court has\nheld, however, that the particular conduct at issue here\nconstitutes a form of expression that is protected by the\nFirst Amendment. It is now well established that the\nFirst Amendment shields the right of a group to engage in\nexpressive association by limiting membership to persons\nwhose admission does not significantly interfere with the\ngroup\u2019s ability to convey its views. See Dale, supra, at\n648; Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623\n(1984); see also New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of\nNew York, 487 U.

See ante, at 3. This argument is also con\ntrary to established law. In Rosenberger, the dissent,\nwhich JUSTICE STEVENS joined, made exactly this argu\nment. See 515 U. S., at 895\u2013896 (opinion of Souter, J.).\nThe Court disagreed, holding that a policy that treated\nsecular speech more favorably than religious speech dis\ncriminated on the basis of viewpoint.4 515 U. S., at 831.\nThe Court reaffirmed this holding in Good News Club, 533\nU. S., at 112, and n. 4.\n  Here, the Nondiscrimination Policy permitted member\nship requirements that expressed a secular viewpoint. See\nApp. 93. (For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus\nand the Hastings Republicans were allowed to exclude\nmembers who disagreed with their parties\u2019 platforms.)\nBut religious groups were not permitted to express a\nreligious viewpoint by limiting membership to students\nwho shared their religious viewpoints.

It would not mean, for\nexample, that fraternities or sororities could exclude stu\ndents on that basis. As our cases have recognized, the\nright of expressive association permits a group to exclude\nan applicant for membership only if the admission of that\nperson would \u201caffec[t] in a significant way the group\u2019s\nability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d Dale,\n530 U. S., at 648. Groups that do not engage in expressive\nassociation have no such right. Similarly, groups that are\ndedicated to expressing a viewpoint on a secular topic (for\nexample, a political or ideological viewpoint) would have\nno basis for limiting membership based on religion be\ncause the presence of members with diverse religious\nbeliefs would have no effect on the group\u2019s ability to ex\npress its views. But for religious groups, the situation is\nvery different. This point was put well by a coalition of\nMuslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh groups: \u201cOf course\nthere is a strong interest in prohibiting religious discrimi\nnation where religion is irrelevant. But it is fundamen\ntally confused to apply a rule against religious discrimina\ntion to a religious association.\u201d Brief for American Islamic\nCongress et al. as Amici Curiae 3.\n   Sexual orientation.

Hastings would not allow CLS to\nexpress this viewpoint by limiting membership to persons\nwilling to express a sincere agreement with CLS\u2019s views.\nBy contrast, nothing in the Nondiscrimination Policy\nprohibited a group from expressing a contrary viewpoint\nby limiting membership to persons willing to endorse\nthat group\u2019s beliefs. A Free Love Club could require mem\nbers to affirm that they reject the traditional view of sex\nual morality to which CLS adheres. It is hard to see\nhow this can be viewed as anything other than viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n                                V\n  Hastings\u2019 current policy, as announced for the first time\nin the brief filed in this Court, fares no better than the\npolicy that the law school invoked when CLS\u2019s application\nwas denied. According to Hastings\u2019 brief, its new policy,\ncontrary to the position taken by Hastings officials at an\nearlier point in this litigation, really does not require a\nstudent group to accept all comers. Now, Hastings ex\nplains, its policy allows \u201cneutral and generally applicable\nmembership requirements unrelated to \u2018status or beliefs.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 5. As ex\namples of permissible membership requirements, Hast\nings mentions academic standing, writing ability, \u201cdues,\nattendance, and even conduct requirements.\u201d Ibid.

If that is the school\u2019s current policy, it is hard to see\nwhy CLS may not be registered, for what CLS demands is\nthat members foreswear \u201cunrepentant participation in or\nadvocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.\u201d App. 146. That\n24    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

And if that is the case, it is\nincumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct require\nments are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS\u2019s re\nquirement is not allowed. Hastings has made no effort to\nprovide such an explanation.6\n                              VI\n  I come now to the version of Hastings\u2019 policy that the\nCourt has chosen to address. This is not the policy that\nHastings invoked when CLS was denied registration. Nor\nis it the policy that Hastings now proclaims\u2014and pre\nsumably implements. It is a policy that, as far as the\nrecord establishes, was in force only from the time when it\nwas first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until\nHastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010. Why\nwe should train our attention on this particular policy and\nnot the other two is a puzzle. But in any event, it is clear\nthat the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light\nof the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to\nsay on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.\n                            A\n  Once a state university opens a limited forum, it \u201cmust\nrespect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d Rosenber\nger, 515 U.

Access to the forum is not limited\nto groups devoted to particular purposes. The regulations\nprovide that a group applying for registration must submit\nan official document including \u201ca statement of its purpose,\u201d\nid., at 83a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.A.1 (emphasis\nadded)), but the regulations make no attempt to define the\nlimits of acceptable purposes. The regulations do not\nrequire a group seeking registration to show that it has a\ncertain number of members or that its program is of inter\nest to any particular number of Hastings students. Nor do\nthe regulations require that a group serve a need not met\nby existing groups.\n   The regulations also make it clear that the registration\nprogram is not meant to stifle unpopular speech. They\nproclaim that \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the Dean to\nensure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a\nvariety of viewpoints.\u201d Id., at 82a (Hastings Regulations\n\u00a733.11). They also emphatically disclaim any endorse\nment of or responsibility for views that student groups\nmay express. Id., at 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.D).\n   Taken as a whole, the regulations plainly contemplate\nthe creation of a forum within which Hastings students\nare free to form and obtain registration of essentially the\nsame broad range of private groups that nonstudents may\nform off campus. That is precisely what the parties in this\ncase stipulated: The RSO forum \u201cseeks to promote a diver\nsity of viewpoints among registered student organizations,\nincluding viewpoints on religion and human sexuality.\u201d\nApp. 216 (emphasis added).\n   The way in which the RSO forum actually developed\ncorroborates this design. As noted, Hastings had more\nthan 60 RSOs in 2004\u20132005, each with its own independ\nently devised purpose. Some addressed serious social\nissues; others\u2014for example, the wine appreciation and\nultimate Frisbee clubs\u2014were simply recreational. Some\n26   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\norganizations focused on a subject but did not claim to\npromote a particular viewpoint on that subject (for exam\nple, the Association of Communications, Sports & Enter\ntainment Law); others were defined, not by subject, but by\nviewpoint. The forum did not have a single Party Politics\nClub; rather, it featured both the Hastings Democratic\nCaucus and the Hastings Republicans. There was no\nReproductive Issues Club; the forum included separate\npro-choice and pro-life organizations. Students did not see\nfit to create a Monotheistic Religions Club, but they have\nformed the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association\nand the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students. In\nshort, the RSO forum, true to its design, has allowed\nHastings students to replicate on campus a broad array of\nprivate, independent, noncommercial organizations that is\nvery similar to those that nonstudents have formed in the\noutside world.\n   The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design\nof the RSO forum for the same reason that a state-imposed\naccept-all-comers policy would violate the First Amend\nment rights of private groups if applied off campus. As\nexplained above, a group\u2019s First Amendment right of\nexpressive association is burdened by the \u201cforced inclu\nsion\u201d of members whose presence would \u201caffec[t] in a\nsignificant way the group\u2019s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.\u201d Dale, 530 U. S., at 648. The Court\nhas therefore held that the government may not compel a\ngroup that engages in \u201cexpressive association\u201d to admit\nsuch a member unless the government has a compelling\ninterest, \u201c \u2018unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that\ncannot be achieved through means significantly less re\nstrictive of associational freedoms.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Rob\nerts, 468 U. S., at 623).\n   There can be no dispute that this standard would not\npermit a generally applicable law mandating that private\nreligious groups admit members who do not share the\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Religious groups like CLS obviously en\ngage in expressive association, and no legitimate state\ninterest could override the powerful effect that an accept\nall-comers law would have on the ability of religious\ngroups to express their views. The State of California\nsurely could not demand that all Christian groups admit\nmembers who believe that Jesus was merely human.\nJewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites\nand Holocaust deniers. Muslim groups could not be forced\nto admit persons who are viewed as slandering Islam.\n   While there can be no question that the State of Califor\nnia could not impose such restrictions on all religious\ngroups in the State, the Court now holds that Hastings, a\nstate institution, may impose these very same require\nments on students who wish to participate in a forum that\nis designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.\nThe Court lists four justifications offered by Hastings in\ndefense of the accept-all-comers policy and, deferring to\nthe school\u2019s judgment, ante, at 21, the Court finds all those\njustifications satisfactory, ante, at 21\u201324. If we carry\nout our responsibility to exercise our own independent\njudgment, however, we must conclude that the justifica\ntions offered by Hastings and accepted by the Court are\ninsufficient.\n   The Court first says that the accept-all-comers policy is\nreasonable because it helps Hastings to ensure that \u201c \u2018lead\nership, educational, and social opportunities\u2019 \u201d are afforded\nto all students. Ante, at 21\u201322 (quoting Brief for Respon\ndent Hastings College of Law 32). The RSO forum, how\never, is designed to achieve these laudable ends in a very\ndifferent way\u2014by permitting groups of students, no mat\nter how small, to form the groups they want. In this way,\nthe forum multiplies the opportunity for students to serve\nin leadership positions; it allows students to decide which\neducational opportunities they wish to pursue through\nparticipation in extracurricular activities; and it permits\n28    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

It would be \u201ca daunting labor,\u201d the\nCourt warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether\na group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to\nstatus. Ante, at 22; see also ante, at 2\u20133, n. 1 (opinion\nof STEVENS, J.) (referring to the \u201cimpossible task of\nseparating out belief-based from status-based religious\ndiscrimination\u201d).\n  This is a strange argument, since the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy prohibits discrimination on substantially the same\ngrounds as the antidiscrimination provisions of many\nStates,7 including California, and except for the inclusion\nof the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orien\ntation, the Nondiscrimination Policy also largely tracks\nfederal antidiscrimination laws.8 Moreover, Hastings now\nwillingly accepts greater burdens under its latest policy,\nwhich apparently requires the school to distinguish be\ntween certain \u201cconduct requirements\u201d that are allowed\nand others that are not. Nor is Hastings daunted by the\nlabor of determining whether a club admissions exam\nlegitimately tests knowledge or is a pretext for screening\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See, e.g., Cal.

The long history of disputes about the\nmeaning of Bible passages belies any suggestion that it\nwould be an easy task to determine whether the grading of\nsuch a test was \u201cobjective.\u201d\n   Third, the Court argues that the accept-all-comers\npolicy, by bringing together students with diverse views,\nencourages tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the de\nvelopment of conflict-resolution skills. Ante, at 23. These\nare obviously commendable goals, but they are not un\ndermined by permitting a religious group to restrict mem\nbership to persons who share the group\u2019s faith. Many\nreligious groups impose such restrictions. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Agudath Israel of America as Amicus Curiae 3\n(\u201c[B]ased upon millennia-old Jewish laws and traditions,\nOrthodox Jewish institutions . . . regularly differentiate\nbetween Jews and non-Jews\u201d). Such practices are not\nmanifestations of \u201ccontempt\u201d for members of other faiths.\nCf. ante, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (invoking groups\nthat have \u201ccontempt for Jews, blacks, and women\u201d). Nor\ndo they thwart the objectives that Hastings endorses. Our\ncountry as a whole, no less than the Hastings College of\nLaw, values tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the\namicable resolution of conflicts. But we seek to achieve\nthose goals through \u201c[a] confident pluralism that conduces\nto civil peace and advances democratic consensus\nbuilding,\u201d not by abridging First Amendment rights. Brief\nfor Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty as Amicus\nCuriae 35.\n   Fourth, the Court observes that Hastings\u2019 policy \u201cincor\nporates\u2014in fact, subsumes\u2014state-law proscriptions on\ndiscrimination.\u201d Ante, at 23. Because the First Amend\nment obviously takes precedence over any state law, this\n30   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould not justify the Hastings policy even if it were true\u2014\nbut it is not. The only Hastings policy considered by the\nCourt\u2014the accept-all-comers policy\u2014goes far beyond any\nCalifornia antidiscrimination law. Neither Hastings nor\nthe Court claims that California law demands that state\nentities must accept all comers. Hastings itself certainly\ndoes not follow this policy in hiring or student admissions.\n   Nor is it at all clear that California law requires Hast\nings to deny registration to a religious group that limits\nmembership to students who share the group\u2019s religious\nbeliefs. Hastings cites no California court decision or\nadministrative authority addressing this question. In\nstead, Hastings points to a statute prohibiting discrimina\ntion on specified grounds, including religion or sexual\norientation, \u201cin any program or activity conducted by\u201d\ncertain postsecondary educational institutions. Cal. Educ.\nCode Ann. \u00a766270 (West Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).\nHastings, however, does not conduct the activities of the\nstudent groups it registers. Indeed, Hastings disclaims\nsuch responsibility, stating both in its regulations and its\nHandbook for Student Organizations that it \u201cdoes not\nsponsor student organizations and therefore does not\naccept liability for activities of student organizations.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.D);\nApp. 250. In addition, as CLS notes, another provision of\nCalifornia law specifically exempts \u201cany funds that are\nused directly or indirectly for the benefit of student or\nganizations\u201d from a ban on state funding of private groups\nthat discriminate on any of the grounds listed in \u00a766270.\nSee \u00a792150 (West Supp. 2010).\n   The authority to decide whether \u00a766270 or any other\nprovision of California law requires religious student\ngroups at covered institutions to admit members who do\nnot share the groups\u2019 religious views is of course a ques\ntion of state law that we cannot resolve. The materials\nthat have been brought to our attention, however, provide\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The Court proclaims\nthat it would be \u201chard to imagine a more viewpoint\nneutral policy,\u201d ante, at 28, but I would not be so quick to\njump to this conclusion. Even if it is assumed that the\npolicy is viewpoint neutral on its face,10 there is strong\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Although we have held that the sponsor of a limited public forum\n\n\u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set,\u201d Rosenberger, 515\nU. S., at 829, the Court now says that, if the exclusion of a group is\nchallenged, the sponsor can retroactively redraw the boundary lines in\norder to justify the exclusion. See ante, at 21, n. 17. This approach\ndoes not respect our prior holding.\n   10 In Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529\n\nU. S. 217 (2000), the Court considered a university rule permitting the\n\u201cdefund[ing]\u201d of a registered student group through a student referen\ndum. See id., at 224\u2013225. \u201cTo the extent the referendum substitutes\nmajority determinations for viewpoint neutrality,\u201d the Court observed,\n\u201cit would undermine the constitutional protection the [university\u2019s\nregistered student organization] program requires.\u201d Id., at 235. \u201cThe\nwhole theory of viewpoint neutrality is that minority views are treated\nwith the same respect as are majority views.\u201d Ibid.\n   Hastings\u2019 accept-all-comers policy bears a resemblance to the South\nwark referendum process. Both permit the majority to silence a disfa\nvored organization. There is force to CLS\u2019s argument that \u201c[a]llowing\nall students to join and lead any group, even when they disagree with\nit, is tantamount to establishing a majoritarian heckler\u2019s veto\u201d and\n\u201cpotentially turn[s] every group into an organ for the already-dominant\nopinion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 51.\n   The Court attempts to distinguish Southworth as involving a funding\nmechanism for student groups that operated selectively, based on\ngroups\u2019 viewpoints.

See Crawford v. Board of Ed. of\nLos Angeles, 458 U. S. 527, 544 (1982) (\u201c[A] law neutral on\nits face still may be unconstitutional if motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose\u201d). A simple example illustrates\nthis obvious point. Suppose that a hated student group at\na state university has never been able to attract more than\n10 members. Suppose that the university administration,\nfor the purpose of preventing that group from using the\nschool grounds for meetings, adopts a new rule under\nwhich the use of its facilities is restricted to groups with\nmore than 25 members. Although this rule would be\nneutral on its face, its adoption for a discriminatory reason\nwould be illegal.\n   Here, CLS has made a strong showing that Hastings\u2019\nsudden adoption and selective application of its accept-all\ncomers policy was a pretext for the law school\u2019s unlawful\ndenial of CLS\u2019s registration application under the Nondis\ncrimination Policy.\n   Shifting policies. When Hastings denied CLS\u2019s applica\ntion in the fall of 2004, the only policy mentioned was the\nNondiscrimination Policy. In July 2005, the former dean\nsuggested in a deposition that the law school actually\nfollowed the very different accept-all-comers policy. In\nMarch of this year, Hastings\u2019 brief in this Court rolled out\nstill a third policy.

See 529\nU. S., at 230, 235.

Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS\u2019s open\ning brief challenged the constitutionality\u2014and the plausi\nbility\u2014of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed\na new policy. As is true in the employment context,\n\u201c[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes\nduring litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue\nwhether the proffered reason truly motivated the defen\ndant\u2019s decision.\u201d Cicero, supra, at 592.\n   Lack of documentation. When an employer has a writ\nten policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no\nwritten documentation, that deviation may support an\ninference of pretext. See, e.g., Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd.\nPartnership, 521 F. 3d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); Rudin v.\nLincoln Land Community College, 420 F. 3d 712, 727 (CA7\n2005); Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., 398 F. 3d 345, 354,\nn. 29 (CA5 2005); Russell v. TG Missouri Corp., 340 F. 3d\n735, 746 (CA8 2003); Mohammed v. Callaway, 698 F. 2d\n395, 399\u2013400, 401 (CA10 1983).\n   Here, Hastings claims that it has had an accept-all\ncomers policy since 1990, but it has not produced a single\nwritten document memorializing that policy. Nor has it\ncited a single occasion prior to the dean\u2019s deposition when\nthis putative policy was orally disclosed to either student\ngroups interested in applying for registration or to the\n34    CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n          HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nOffice of Student Services, which was charged with re\nviewing the bylaws of applicant groups to ensure that they\nwere in compliance with the law school\u2019s policies.\n  Nonenforcement. Since it appears that no one was told\nabout the accept-all-comers policy before July 2005, it is\nnot surprising that the policy was not enforced. The re\ncord is replete with evidence that Hastings made no effort\nto enforce the all-comers policy until after it was pro\nclaimed by the former dean. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for\nCert. 118a (Hastings Democratic Caucus); id., at 110a\n(Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings); id.,\nat 146a\u2013147a (Vietnamese American Law Society); id., at\n142a\u2013143a (Silent Right); App. 192 (La Raza). See gener\nally supra, at 7\u20138. If the record here is not sufficient to\npermit a finding of pretext, then the law of pretext is dead.\n  The Court\u2014understandably\u2014sidesteps this issue. The\nCourt states that the lower courts did not address the\n\u201cargument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comer\npolicy,\u201d11 that \u201cthis Court is not the proper forum to air the\nissue in the first instance,\u201d and that \u201c[o]n remand, the\nNinth Circuit may consider CLS\u2019s pretext argument if,\nand to the extent, it is preserved.\u201d Ante, at 31\u201332.\n  Because the Court affirms the entry of summary judg\nment in favor of respondents, it is not clear how CLS will\nbe able to ask the Ninth Circuit on remand to review its\nclaim of pretext. And the argument that we should not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As  previously noted, CLS consistently argued in the courts below\nthat Hastings had applied its registration policy in a discriminatory\nmanner. See supra, at 9\u201310, n. 1. The Court would ignore these\narguments because counsel for CLS acknowledged below that Hastings\nhas an all-comers policy. See ante, at 9, n. 5 (quoting examples). But\nas the Court itself acknowledges, counsel for CLS stated at oral argu\nment in this Court that \u201cthe Court needs to . . . reach the constitution\nality of the all-comers policy as applied to CLS in this case.\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 59 (emphasis added); ante, at 9, n. 5. And as the record shows,\nCLS has never ceded its argument that Hastings applies its accept-all\ncomers policy unequally.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          35\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\naddress this issue of pretext because the Ninth Circuit did\nnot do so is hard to take, given that the Ninth Circuit\nbarely addressed anything, disposing of this case in pre\ncisely two sentences.\n   Neither of those two sentences addressed the \u201cnovel\nquestion,\u201d ante, at 1, to which the bulk of this Court\u2019s\nopinion is devoted, i.e., whether the accept-all-comers\npolicy is reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO\nforum and is viewpoint neutral, see ante, at 17\u201331. If it is\nappropriate for us to consider that issue, then the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s failure to address the issue of pretext should not\nstand in the way of review by this Court.\n                            C\n   One final aspect of the Court\u2019s decision warrants com\nment. In response to the argument that the accept-all\ncomers-policy would permit a small and unpopular group\nto be taken over by students who wish to silence its mes\nsage, the Court states that the policy would permit a\nregistered group to impose membership requirements\n\u201cdesigned to ensure that students join because of their\ncommitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its demise.\u201d Ante, at\n27. With this concession, the Court tacitly recognizes that\nHastings does not really have an accept-all-comers pol\nicy\u2014it has an accept-some-dissident-comers policy\u2014and\nthe line between members who merely seek to change a\ngroup\u2019s message (who apparently must be admitted) and\nthose who seek a group\u2019s \u201cdemise\u201d (who may be kept out)\nis hopelessly vague.\n   Here is an example. Not all Christian denominations\nagree with CLS\u2019s views on sexual morality and other\nmatters. During a recent year, CLS had seven members.\nSuppose that 10 students who are members of denomina\ntions that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was mis\nrepresenting true Christian doctrine. Suppose that these\nstudents joined CLS, elected officers who shared their\n36   CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,\n         HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nviews, ended the group\u2019s affiliation with the national\norganization, and changed the group\u2019s message. The new\nleadership would likely proclaim that the group was \u201cvi\ntal\u201d but rectified, while CLS, I assume, would take the\nview that the old group had suffered its \u201cdemise.\u201d\nWhether a change represents reform or transformation\nmay depend very much on the eye of the beholder.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY takes a similarly mistaken tack. He\ncontends that CLS \u201cwould have a substantial case on the\nmerits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was . . .\nused to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in\norder to stifle its views,\u201d ante, at 4 (concurring opinion),\nbut he does not explain on what ground such a claim could\nsucceed. The Court holds that the accept-all-comers policy\nis viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the pur\nposes of the RSO forum. How could those characteristics\nbe altered by a change in the membership of one of the\nforum\u2019s registered groups? No explanation is apparent.\n   In the end, the Court refuses to acknowledge the conse\nquences of its holding. A true accept-all-comers policy\npermits small unpopular groups to be taken over by stu\ndents who wish to change the views that the group ex\npresses. Rules requiring that members attend meetings,\npay dues, and behave politely, see ante, at 27, would not\neliminate this threat.\n   The possibility of such takeovers, however, is by no\nmeans the most important effect of the Court\u2019s holding.\nThere are religious groups that cannot in good conscience\nagree in their bylaws that they will admit persons who do\nnot share their faith, and for these groups, the conse\nquence of an accept-all-comers policy is marginalization.\nSee Brief for Evangelical Scholars (Officers and 24 Former\nPresidents of the Evangelical Theological Society) et al. as\nAmici Curiae 19 (affirmance in this case \u201cwill allow every\npublic college and university in the United States to ex\nclude all evangelical Christian organizations\u201d); Brief for\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This is where the Court\u2019s deci\nsion leads.\n                         *    *    *\n   I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today\u2019s\ndecision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in\nthis country. Our First Amendment reflects a \u201cprofound\nnational commitment to the principle that debate on\npublic issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide\nopen.\u201d New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270\n(1964). Even if the United States is the only Nation that\nshares this commitment to the same extent, I would not\nchange our law to conform to the international norm. I\nfear that the Court\u2019s decision marks a turn in that direc\ntion. Even those who find CLS\u2019s views objectionable\nshould be concerned about the way the group has been\ntreated\u2014by Hastings, the Court of Appeals, and now this\nCourt. I can only hope that this decision will turn out to\nbe an aberration.\n</pre>",
