Argued November 2, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010\nAfter respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New\n  York law on petitioner Shady Grove’s insurance claim, Shady Grove\n  filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it\n  and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal\n  Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of\n  jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which precludes a\n  class action to recover a “penalty” such as statutory interest. Affirm\n  ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in\n  compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072, would\n  control if it conflicted with §901(b), but held there was no conflict be\n  cause §901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues—eligibility of the\n  particular type of claim for class treatment and certifiability of a\n  given class, respectively. Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court\n  of Appeals held that §901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting\n  in diversity because it is “substantive” within the meaning of Erie R.\n  Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n549 F. 3d 137, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  PARTS I and II–A, concluding that §901(b) does not preclude a federal\n  district court sitting in diversity from entertaining a class action un\n  der Rule 23. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) If Rule 23 answers the question in dispute, it governs here\n  unless it exceeds its statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemak\n  ing power. Burlington Northern R. Co. v.

CO.\n                            Syllabus\n\n       (b) Rule 23(b) answers the question in dispute—whether Shady\n    Grove’s suit may proceed as a class action—when it states that “[a]\n    class action may be maintained” if certain conditions are met. Since\n    §901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady\n    Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as a class action” because of the\n    relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless\n    Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit’s view that §901(b) and\n    Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil\n    ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23\n    explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case\n    meeting its criteria. Allstate’s arguments based on the exclusion of\n    some federal claims from Rule 23’s reach pursuant to federal statutes\n    and on §901’s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4–6.\n       (c) The dissent’s claim that §901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be\n    cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is\n    foreclosed by §901(b)’s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.\n    The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to\n    avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), does\n    not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent’s approach does not\n    avoid a conflict between §901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren\n    der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6–12.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II–B and II–D:\n       (a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072, not Erie, controls\n    the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)’s re\n    quirement that federal procedural rules “not abridge, enlarge or mod\n    ify any substantive right” means that a Rule must “really regulat[e]\n    procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec\n    ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and\n    redress for disregard or infraction of them,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n    312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party’s\n    rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing\n    those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,\n    or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that\n    criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\n    separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate’s arguments\n    asserting §901(b)’s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the\n    substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat\n    ters, but that of the Federal Rule. See, e.g., id., at 14. Pp. 12–16.\n       (b) Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in\n    state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable re\n    sult of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress cre\n    ated.

S., at 13–14. Pp. 16–22.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n  must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and\n  it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case. Pp. 1–22.\n            (a) When the application of a federal rule would “abridge,\n  enlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), the\n  federal rule cannot govern. In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates\n  an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied,\n  displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use\n  of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it\n  functions to define the scope of the state-created right. Examples\n  may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to\n  bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of\n  recovery. An application of a federal rule that directly collides with\n  such a state law violates the Rules Enabling Act. Pp. 1–13.\n            (b) N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), however, is not such a\n  state law. It is a procedural rule that is not part of New York’s sub\n  stantive law.

As partial payment for that care, Galvez\nassigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits\nunder a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance\nCo. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene­\nfits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to\npay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. §5106(a)\n(West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time,\nand it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on\nthe overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see ibid.\n   Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York to recover the unpaid statutory in­\nterest.

Law Ann. §901(b), which pre­\ncludes a suit to recover a “penalty” from proceeding as a\nclass action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,\ndespite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding\nthat statutory interest is a “penalty” under New York law,\nit held that §901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.\nAnd, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim\n(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in­\ncontroversy requirement for individual suits under 28\nU. S. C. §1332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The\ncourt did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com­\npliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072,\nwould control if it conflicted with §901(b). But there was\nno conflict because (as we will describe in more detail\nbelow) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and\n§901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule\non point, the Court of Appeals held that §901(b) is “sub­\nstantive” within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U. S. 64 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal\ncourts sitting in diversity.\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n   The framework for our decision is familiar. We must\nfirst determine whether Rule 23 answers the question in\ndispute. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1,\n——————\n  3 Shady Grove had asserted jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(2),\n\nwhich relaxes, for class actions seeking at least $5 million, the rule\nagainst aggregating separate claims for calculation of the amount in\ncontroversy. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545\nU. S. 546, 571 (2005).\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\n4–5 (1987). If it does, it governs—New York’s law not­\nwithstanding—unless it exceeds statutory authorization or\nCongress’s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.\nPlumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463–464 (1965). We do not wade\ninto Erie’s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli­\ncable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469–471.\n                              A\n   The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove’s suit\nmay proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an­\nswer. It states that “[a] class action may be maintained” if\ntwo conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria\nset forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also\nmust fit into one of the three categories described in sub­\ndivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this\ncreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit\nmeets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class\naction. (The Federal Rules regularly use “may” to confer\ncategorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n8(d)(2)–(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)–(b), 20(a)(1)–(2), 27(a)(1),\n30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural\nentitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–5(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all\nformula for deciding the class-action question. Because\n§901(b) attempts to answer the same question—i.e., it\nstates that Shady Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as\na class action” (emphasis added) because of the relief it\nseeks—it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.\n   The Second Circuit believed that §901(b) and Rule 23 do\nnot conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,\nit said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether\na given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on\nthe other hand, addresses an antecedent question:\nwhether the particular type of claim is eligible for class\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

See 549 F. 3d, at 143–144. Allstate embraces\nthis analysis. Brief for Respondent 12–13.\n   We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility\nand certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi­\ntions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that\neligibility must depend on the “particular cause of action”\nasserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at\n12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro­\nvide that only claims involving more than a certain num­\nber of plaintiffs are “eligible” for class treatment in federal\ncourt. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)’s prerequi­\nsites “eligibility criteria” would obviate Allstate’s objec­\ntion—a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc­\ntion is made-to-order.\n   There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as\naddressing only whether claims made eligible for class\ntreatment by some other law should be certified as class\nactions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly\nnor implicitly empowers a federal court “to certify a class\nin each and every case” where the Rule’s criteria are met.\nId., at 13–14. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It\nsays that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied “[a]\nclass action may be maintained” (emphasis added)—not “a\nclass action may be permitted.” Courts do not maintain\nactions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23’s\n“may” is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring\nhis claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati\ncally applies “in all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699–700 (1979).\n   Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some\nfederal claims from Rule 23’s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(e)(1)(B)—which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule\n23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\nrather leaves room for laws like §901(b). But Congress,\nunlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an\nindividual rule as it sees fit—either by directly amending\nthe rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in\ncertain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517\nU. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created\nspecific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule\ndoes not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If\nRule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,\nthe statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.\n  Allstate next suggests that the structure of §901 shows\nthat Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),\nit notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly\nanalogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that\nsubsection is pre-empted). But §901(b)’s rule barring class\nactions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,\nand where it applies §901(a) does not. This shows, accord­\ning to Allstate, that §901(b) concerns a separate subject.\nPerhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub­\nject of §901(a). But the question before us is whether it\nconcerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23—\nand for purposes of answering that question the way New\nYork has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23\npermits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a\nState cannot limit that permission by structuring one part\nof its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part\nthat imposes additional requirements. Both of §901’s\nsubsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule\n23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.\nCf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7–8.\n  The dissent argues that §901(b) has nothing to do with\nwhether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class\naction, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.\nSee post, at 8–17 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.).

Accordingly, the dissent says,\nRule 23 and New York’s law may coexist in peace.\n   We need not decide whether a state law that limits the\nremedies available in an existing class action would con­\nflict with Rule 23; that is not what §901(b) does. By its\nterms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from “main­\ntain[ing]” a class action seeking statutory penalties.\nUnlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other\nremedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,\n§901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may\naward; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming\ninto existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by\n§901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu­\ntory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in\nadvance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the\nevent the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the\nstatute’s clear prohibition on “maintain[ing]” such suits as\nclass actions.\n   The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid §901(b)’s\nbarrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a\nrequest for statutory penalties. See post, at 14–15. Even\nassuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact\n——————\n   4 Contrary to the dissent’s implication, post, at 13, we express no view\n\nas to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a\nsingle suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.\nWhether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, §901(b) does conflict\nbecause it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main­\ntain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal\nstatutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. §2605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.\n§1854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal\nRules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case\nof a conflict.\n   5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737\n8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                the Court\n\nthat a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class\naction would not at all prove that §901(b) is addressed\nonly to remedies. If the state law instead banned class\nactions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff\ncould drop the fraud counts from his complaint and pro­\nceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would\nnot mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban\nwould affect only the procedural means by which the\nremedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent\ncorrectly abandons Allstate’s eligibility-certifiability dis­\ntinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.\n  The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of\n§901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23—i.e., whether\na class action may be maintained—but insists the provi­\nsion’s purpose is to restrict only remedies. See post, at 12–\n15; post, at 15 (“[W]hile phrased as responsive to the\nquestion whether certain class actions may begin, §901(b)\nis unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions\nmust end”). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further proce­\ndural fairness and efficiency, §901(b) (we are told) “re­\nsponds to an entirely different concern”: the fear that\nallowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide\nbasis would “produce overkill.” Post, at 12, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent reaches this con­\nclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in\nthe law’s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the\nLegislature “apparently fear[ed]” that combining class\nactions and statutory penalties “could result in annihilat­\ning punishment of the defendant,” V. Alexander, Practice\nCommentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney’s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in­\nternal quotation marks omitted); (3) a remark by the\nGovernor in his signing statement that §901(b) “ ‘ provides\n——————\nN.

Y. Laws,\nat 1748; emphasis deleted), and (4) a state court’s state­\nment that the final text of §901(b) “ ‘was the result of a\ncompromise among competing interests,’ ” post, at 9 (quot­\ning Sperry v. Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863\nN. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).\n  This evidence of the New York Legislature’s purpose is\npretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent’s account of\nthe Legislature’s objective at face value, it cannot override\nthe statute’s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the\nremedy a plaintiff can obtain, §901(b) achieves that end by\nlimiting a plaintiff’s power to maintain a class action. The\nmanner in which the law “could have been written,” post,\nat 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla­\nture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our\nperception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).6 The\ndissent’s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated\nrather than furthered by revising state laws when a po­\n——————\n  6 Our  decision in Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),\ndiscussed by the dissent, post, at 5–6, 13–14, n. 8, is not to the contrary.\nThere we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is\n“ ‘commenced’ ” by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a\nstate law providing that “ ‘[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,\nwithin the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each\ndefendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .’ ”\n446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, §97 (1971); altera­\ntion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, “governs the\ndate from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules\nbegin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations” or tolling\nrules, which it did not “purpor[t] to displace.” 446 U. S., at 751, 750.\nThe texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed\nthat the State’s actual-service rule was (in the State’s judgment) an\n“integral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita­\ntions,” id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court\nmay resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal\nrules by resorting to the state law’s ostensible objectives.\n10     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\ntential conflict with a Federal Rule arises; the state­\nfriendly approach would be to accept the law as written\nand test the validity of the Federal Rule.\n   The dissent’s approach of determining whether state\nand federal rules conflict based on the subjective inten­\ntions of the state legislature is an enterprise destined to\nproduce “confusion worse confounded,” Sibbach v. Wilson\n& Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941). It would mean, to begin\nwith, that one State’s statute could survive pre-emption\n(and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court)\nwhile another State’s identical law would not, merely\nbecause its authors had different aspirations. It would\nalso mean that district courts would have to discern, in\nevery diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively\npre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely\nconflicts with federal law. That task will often prove\narduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the\naim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to\nthe extent the dissent’s purpose-driven approach depends\non its characterization of §901(b)’s aims as substantive, it\nwould apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to\nprocedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody\npolicy preferences about the types of claims that should\nsucceed—as do rules governing summary judgment, pre­\ntrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.\nHard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state\nsupreme court’s pronouncement of the law’s purpose\nwould settle the issue, since existence of the factual predi­\ncate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a fed­\neral question. Predictably, federal judges would be con­\ndemned to poring through state legislative history—which\nmay be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less famil­\niar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky & D. Dunn,\nFundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Tor­\nres & Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, An­\nnotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib.

The central difficulty is that even artificial\nnarrowing cannot render §901(b) compatible with Rule 23.\nWhatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict\neach other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see\npost, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in\na manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat­\nute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings—one\nthat would violate §2072(b) and another that would not—\nwe would agree. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 842, 845 (1999); cf. Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed\nMartin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001). But it is not.\nRule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any\nfederal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the\nRule’s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text,\neven to avert a collision with state law that might render\n——————\n  7 The    dissent also suggests that we should read the Federal Rules\n“ ‘with sensitivity to important state interests’ ” and “ ‘to avoid conflict\nwith important state regulatory policies.’ ” Post, at 7 (quoting Gasperini\nv. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427, n. 7, 438, n. 22\n(1996)). The search for state interests and policies that are “important”\nis just as standardless as the “important or substantial” criterion we\nrejected in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), to define\nthe state-created rights a Federal Rule may not abridge.\n   If all the dissent means is that we should read an ambiguous Federal\nRule to avoid “substantial variations [in outcomes] between state and\nfederal litigation,” Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S.\n497, 504 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), we entirely agree.\nWe should do so not to avoid doubt as to the Rule’s validity—since a\nFederal Rule that fails Erie’s forum-shopping test is not ipso facto\ninvalid, see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469–472 (1965)—but\nbecause it is reasonable to assume that “Congress is just as concerned\nas we have been to avoid significant differences between state and\nfederal courts in adjudicating claims,” Stewart Organization, Inc. v.\nRicoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22, 37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The\nassumption is irrelevant here, however, because there is only one\nreasonable reading of Rule 23.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nit invalid. See Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740,\n750, n. 9 (1980).8 What the dissent’s approach achieves is\nnot the avoiding of a “conflict between Rule 23 and\n§901(b),” post, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23\n(pursuant to §2072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the\nextent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of\n§901. There is no other way to reach the dissent’s destina­\ntion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule\n23 falls within the statutory authorization.\n                               B\n   Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts\nto supplant state law with judge-made rules. In that\ncontext, it made no difference whether the rule was tech­\nnically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was\nwhether it “significantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.”\nGuaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That\nis not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu­\ntory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has\nundoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted\npower to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so\nlong as those rules regulate matters “rationally capable of\nclassification” as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In\nthe Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28\nU. S.

S., at 14; see Hanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480\nU. S., at 8. The test is not whether the rule affects a\nlitigant’s substantive rights; most procedural rules do.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438,\n445 (1946). What matters is what the rule itself regulates:\nIf it governs only “the manner and the means” by which\nthe litigants’ rights are “enforced,” it is valid; if it alters\n“the rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate\n[those] rights,” it is not. Id., at 446 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Applying that test, we have rejected every statutory\nchallenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us. We\nhave found to be in compliance with §2072(b) rules pre­\nscribing methods for serving process, see id., at 445–446\n(Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(f)); Hanna, supra, at 463–465 (Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(d)(1)), and requiring litigants whose\nmental or physical condition is in dispute to submit to\nexaminations, see Sibbach, supra, at 14–16 (Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 35); Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 113–\n114 (1964) (same). Likewise, we have upheld rules au­\nthorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file\nfrivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed. Rule\nApp. Proc. 38), or who sign court papers without a reason­\nable inquiry into the facts asserted, see Business Guides,\nInc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498\nU. S. 533, 551–554 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11). Each\nof these rules had some practical effect on the parties’\nrights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for\nenforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,\nthe available remedies, or the rules of decision by which\nthe court adjudicated either.\n   Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules\nallowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi­\n14      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder\nof parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules\nneither change plaintiffs’ separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants’ rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23—at\nleast insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\nseparate claims against the same defendants in a class\naction—falls within §2072(b)’s authorization. A class\naction, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a\nspecies), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate\nclaims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate\nsuits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties’\nlegal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision\nunchanged.\n   Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions\nis not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue\non behalf of a class “transform[s] [the] dispute over a five\nhundred dollar penalty into a dispute over a five million\ndollar penalty.” Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate’s aggre­\ngate liability, however, does not depend on whether the\nsuit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus\nmembers of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl­\nedges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual\nclaim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who\nwould not bring individual suits for the relatively small\nsums involved will choose to join a class action. That has\nno bearing, however, on Allstate’s or the plaintiffs’ legal\nrights. The likelihood that some (even many) plaintiffs\nwill be induced to sue by the availability of a class action\nis just the sort of “incidental effec[t]” we have long held\ndoes not violate §2072(b), Mississippi Publishing, supra,\nat 445.\n   Allstate argues that Rule 23 violates §2072(b) because\nthe state law it displaces, §901(b), creates a right that\nthe Federal Rule abridges—namely, a “substantive\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

To\nbegin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of\n§901(b) (which is to be found in New York’s procedural\ncode) confines it to claims under New York law; and of\ncourse New York has no power to alter substantive rights\nand duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,\nthe consequence of excluding certain class actions may be\nto cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,\nbut the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,\n§901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple\njoinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even\nif §901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted “for\nsubstantive reasons,” id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end\nwas not to improve “the conduct of the litigation process\nitself” but to alter “the outcome of that process.” Id., at 26.\n   The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is\nthat the substantive nature of New York’s law, or its\nsubstantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule\nof Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid\nin others—or valid in some cases and invalid in others—\ndepending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state\nsubstantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for\nsubstantive purposes). That could not be clearer in\nSibbach:\n    “The petitioner says the phrase [‘substantive rights’ in\n    the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use\n    Congress intended that in regulating procedure this\n    Court should not deal with important and substantial\n    rights theretofore recognized.

S., at 13–14 (footnotes omitted).\nHanna unmistakably expressed the same understanding\nthat compliance of a Federal Rule with the Enabling Act is\nto be assessed by consulting the Rule itself, and not its\neffects in individual applications:\n     “[T]he court has been instructed to apply the Federal\n     Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory\n     Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their\n     prima facie judgment that the Rule in question trans­\n     gresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor con­\n     stitutional restrictions.” 380 U. S., at 471.\n   In sum, it is not the substantive or procedural nature or\npurpose of the affected state law that matters, but the\nsubstantive or procedural nature of the Federal Rule. We\nhave held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that\nthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon\nwhether it regulates procedure. See Sibbach, supra, at 14;\nHanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480 U. S., at 8. If it\ndoes, it is authorized by §2072 and is valid in all jurisdic­\ntions, with respect to all claims, regardless of its incidental\neffect upon state-created rights.\n                           C\n  A few words in response to the concurrence.

Post, at\n5–7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23\nand §901(b) conflict, post, at 15–16, and departs from us\nonly with respect to the second part of the test, i.e.,\nwhether application of the Federal Rule violates §2072(b),\npost, at 7–13. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason\ndifferent from ours. Post, at 17–22.\n  The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not\nthat Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it dis­\nplaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not “function\nas a part of the State’s definition of substantive rights and\nremedies.” Post, at 1. A state procedural rule is not pre­\nempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is “so bound up with,” or “sufficiently intertwined\nwith,” a substantive state-law right or remedy “that it\ndefines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,”\npost, at 4, 13.\n  This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which\nestablished the rule we apply. The concurrence contends\nthat Sibbach did not rule out its approach, but that is not\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on\nthe idiosyncrasies of state law, Sibbach adopted and ap­\nplied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal\nRule “really regulates procedure.” 312 U.

Had\nSibbach been applying the concurrence’s theory, that is quite true—\nwhich demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with Sibbach. For\nconformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the very issue Sibbach\ndecided: The petitioner’s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded\nthe Enabling Act’s authorization, 312 U.

S., at 113–114, and we see no reason\nto find such an implied limitation today.\n  In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply Sibbach,\nbut to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its\napproach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the\nstatutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from\n“abridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive\nright,” §2072(b). See post, at 9–10. There is something to\nthat. It is possible to understand how it can be deter­\nmined whether a Federal Rule “enlarges” substantive\n——————\ncould not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now\nadvocates.\n  The concurrence responds that the “the specific question of ‘the\nobligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state’ ” was\nnot before the Court, post, at 12 (quoting Sibbach, supra, at 9). It is\nclear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie\nprohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion\nunquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules’ compliance with §2072(b),\nand it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,\nwhich does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule\nabridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13–14. To the\nextent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules’ validity vis-à-vis\ncontrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U. S., at 472, and it made\nclear that Sibbach’s test still controls, see 380 U. S., at 464–465,\n470–471.\n  10 The concurrence insists that we have misread Sibbach, since surely\n\na Federal Rule that “in most cases” regulates procedure does not do so\nwhen it displaces one of those “rare” state substantive laws that are\ndisguised as rules of procedure. Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what\nthe Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex­\nplained, supra, at 12–13, most Rules have some effect on litigants’\nsubstantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not\nmean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But it is\nhard to understand how it can be determined whether a\nFederal Rule “abridges” or “modifies” substantive rights\nwithout knowing what state-created rights would obtain if\nthe Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach’s exclusive focus\non the challenged Federal Rule—driven by the very real\nconcern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State\nwould be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13–14—is hard to square\nwith §2072(b)’s terms.11\n  Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven\ndecades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a “special\n——————\n   11 The concurrence’s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the\n\nstatute’s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only\nof “substantive rights,” but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption\nof “procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a\nsubstantive right or remedy,” post, at 19. This would allow States to\nforce a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as\nthey are “sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.” Post,\nat 13.\n   12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,\n\napparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13–14, n. 14. We\nare unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if\nthe case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,\nthe concurrence’s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag­\ngerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as\nestablishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464–465, 470–471.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445–446\n(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the\nFederal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business\nGuides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.\n533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna—\nwhich as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.\nSee Burlington Northern, supra, at 5–6, 8; Business Guides, supra, at\n552–554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the\nU. S. Reports, its rule—and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule\nas the proper unit of analysis—is alive and well.\n   In contrast, Hanna’s obscure obiter dictum that a court “need not\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

And a party\nseeking to overturn a statutory precedent bears an even\ngreater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us,\nibid., and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see,\ne.g., Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 556 (1989); 28\nU. S. C. §1367; Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services,\nInc., 545 U. S. 546, 558 (2005). We do Congress no service\nby presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate\nhas not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car­\nried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.\nAlvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast\naside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since\n(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the\nresult.13\n—————— \n\nwholly blind itself” to a Federal Rule’s effect on a case’s outcome, 380 \n\nU. S., at 473—which the concurrence invokes twice, post, at 8, 13–14,\nn. 14—has never resurfaced in our opinions in the 45 years since its\nfirst unfortunate utterance. Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach’s\nstraightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for\nthat statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency\nbetween the two.\n   13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi­\n\ntion any rule that “really regulates procedure,” Sibbach, supra, at 14,\nwill pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however “bound up” the latter is\nwith substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that\nresult proves our interpretation of §2072(b) implausible, post, at 10,\nn. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term “substantive\nrights” in §2072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but\nalso any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the\ntext nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The\nexamples the concurrence offers—statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards—do not\nmake its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They\nmerely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine\nwhether a rule “really regulates” procedure or substance. If one con­\ncludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal\nRule itself is invalid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See post, at 11, n. 10.\nUndoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have\nmanaged to muddle through well enough in the 69 years\nsince Sibbach was decided). But as the concurrence ac­\nknowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:\nThe statute itself refers to “substantive right[s],” §2072(b),\nso there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc­\ntion. What is more, the concurrence’s approach does\nnothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it\nmany times over. Instead of a single hard question of\nwhether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure,\nthat approach will present hundreds of hard questions,\nforcing federal courts to assess the substantive or proce­\ndural character of countless state rules that may conflict\nwith a single Federal Rule.14 And it still does not sidestep\nthe problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one\nmust come face to face with the decision whether or not\nthe state policy (with which a putatively procedural state\nrule may be “bound up”) pertains to a “substantive right or\nremedy,” post, at 19—that is, whether it is substance or\nprocedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to\n——————\n  The concurrence’s concern would make more sense if many Federal\nRules that effectively alter state-law rights “bound up with procedures”\nwould survive under Sibbach. But as the concurrence concedes, post, at\n11, n. 10, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier\ninstances does not prove Sibbach’s interpretation is absurd. Congress\nmay well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure.\n  14 The concurrence argues that its approach is no more “taxing” than\n\nours because few if any Federal Rules that are “facially valid” under the\nEnabling Act will fail the concurrence’s test. Post, at 11, and n. 10. But\nthat conclusion will be reached only after federal courts have consid­\nered hundreds of state rules applying the concurrence’s inscrutable\nstandard.\n  15 The concurrence insists that the task will be easier if courts can\n22       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

That is unaccept­\nable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules\ncreated to fill supposed “gaps” in positive federal law. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471–472. For where neither the Con­\nstitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of deci­\nsion or authorizes a federal court to supply one, “state law\nmust govern because there can be no other law.” Ibid.; see\nClark, Erie’s Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289,\n1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the\nattendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable\n(indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the\npossibility that the same case may follow a different course\nif filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472–473. The short of the matter is that a Federal\nRule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters\nthe outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shop­\nping. To hold otherwise would be to “disembowel either the\nConstitution’s grant of power over federal procedure” or\nCongress’s exercise of it.

C. §1652, and make the “relatively unguided Erie\nchoice,”2 Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether\nthe state law is the “rule of decision.” But when a situa\ntion is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act\ninquiry by its own terms does not apply. See §1652;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act\n(Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U. S. C. §2072.\n   That does not mean, however, that the federal rule\nalways governs. Congress has provided for a system of\nuniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts\nsitting in diversity operate as “an independent system for\nadministering justice to litigants who properly invoke its\njurisdiction,” Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,\nInc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court\nclones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are\nmanaged by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n473–474. But while Congress may have the constitutional\npower to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with\nstate substantive law in any number of respects, that is\nnot what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in\nthe Enabling Act that although “[t]he Supreme Court”\nmay “prescribe general rules of practice and procedure,”\n§2072(a), those rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right,” §2072(b). Therefore, “[w]hen a\nsituation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the\ncourt has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule”\nunless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.\nHanna, 380 U.

Ibid.; see also id., at 469–470. The\nEnabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in\nthe “relatively unguided Erie choice,” id., at 471, but\ninstead instructs only that federal rules cannot “abridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,” §2072(b). The\nEnabling Act’s limitation does not mean that federal rules\ncannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that\nfederal rules cannot displace a State’s definition of its own\nrights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.\n1, 13–14 (1941) (reasoning that “the phrase ‘substantive\nrights’ ” embraces only those state rights that are sought\nto be enforced in the judicial proceedings).\n   Congress has thus struck a balance: “[H]ousekeeping\nrules for federal courts” will generally apply in diversity\ncases, notwithstanding that some federal rules “will inevi\ntably differ” from state rules. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473.\nBut not every federal “rul[e] of practice or procedure,”\n§2072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal\nrules must be interpreted with some degree of “sensitivity\nto important state interests and regulatory policies,”\nGasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415,\n427, n. 7 (1996), and applied to diversity cases against the\nbackground of Congress’ command that such rules not\nalter substantive rights and with consideration of “the\ndegree to which the Rule makes the character and result\nof the federal litigation stray from the course it would\nfollow in state courts,” Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473. This can\nbe a tricky balance to implement.3\n    It is important to observe that the balance Congress\n\n——————\n  3 SeeChemerinsky §5.3, at 321 (observing that courts “have struggled\nto develop an approach that permits uniform procedural rules to be\napplied in federal court while still allowing state substantive law to\ngovern”).\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

And in my view,\nthe application of that balance does not necessarily turn\non whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is\ntraditionally described as substantive or procedural.\nRather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part\nof a State’s framework of substantive rights or remedies.\nSee §2072(b); cf. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471 (“The line be\ntween ‘substance’ and ‘procedure’ shifts as the legal con\ntext changes”); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99,\n108 (1945) (noting that the words “ ‘substance’ ” and “ ‘pro\ncedure’ ” “[e]ach impl[y] different variables depending\nupon the particular problem for which [they] are used”).\n  Applying this balance, therefore, requires careful inter\npretation of the state and federal provisions at issue. “The\nline between procedural and substantive law is hazy,”\nErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 92 (1938) (Reed, J.,\nconcurring), and matters of procedure and matters of\nsubstance are not “mutually exclusive categories with\neasily ascertainable contents,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 17\n(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Rather, “[r]ules which law\nyers call procedural do not always exhaust their effect by\nregulating procedure,” Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\nCorp., 337 U. S. 541, 555 (1949), and in some situations,\n“procedure and substance are so interwoven that rational\nseparation becomes well-nigh impossible,” id., at 559\n(Rutledge, J., dissenting).

And were federal\ncourts to ignore those portions of substantive state law\nthat operate as procedural devices, it could in many in\nstances limit the ways that sovereign States may define\ntheir rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a\ntraditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the\nscope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts\nmust recognize and respect that choice. Cf.

At both steps\nof the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the\nstate law and the federal rule mean.\n   The court must first determine whether the scope of the\nfederal rule is “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” to “ ‘control the issue’ ”\nbefore the court, “thereby leaving no room for the opera\ntion” of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington\nNorthern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987); Walker\nv. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750, and n. 9\n(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate\nalongside the state rule, then there is no “Ac[t] of Con\ngress” governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.\n§1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules\nof Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In\nsome instances, the “plain meaning” of a federal rule will\nnot come into “ ‘direct collision’ ” with the state law, and\nboth can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749.

S., at 427, n. 7, will not collide with the\nstate law.5\n——————\n    5I thus agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 3–7, that a federal\nrule, like any federal law, must be interpreted in light of many different\nconsiderations, including “sensitivity to important state interests,” post,\nat 7, and “regulatory policies,” post, at 2. See Stewart Organization,\nInc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.

I\ndisagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, however, about the degree to which\nthe meaning of federal rules may be contorted, absent congressional\nauthorization to do so, to accommodate state policy goals.\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n  If, on the other hand, the federal rule is “sufficiently\nbroad to control the issue before the Court,” such that\nthere is a “direct collision,” Walker, 446 U. S., at 749–750,\nthe court must decide whether application of the federal\nrule “represents a valid exercise” of the “rulemaking au\nthority . . . bestowed on this Court by the Rules Enabling\nAct.” Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 5; see also\nGasperini, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7; Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471–474. That Act requires, inter alia, that federal rules\n“not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.” 28\nU. S. C. §2072(b) (emphasis added).         Unlike JUSTICE\nSCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that\neffectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created\nright or remedy violates this command. Congress may\nhave the constitutional power “to supplant state law” with\nrules that are “rationally capable of classification as pro\ncedure,” ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbut we should generally presume that it has not done so.\nCf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(observing that “we start with the assumption” that a\nfederal statute does not displace a State’s law “unless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that\nfederal rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right” evinces the opposite intent, as does\nCongress’ decision to delegate the creation of rules to this\nCourt rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§4509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).\n  Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back\ninto the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,\nenlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must\nconsider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to\navoid that impermissible result.

I respectfully disagree.7\nThis interpretation of the Enabling Act is consonant with\nthe Act’s first limitation to “general rules of practice and\nprocedure,” §2072(a). But it ignores the second limitation\nthat such rules also “not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right,” §2072(b) (emphasis added),8 and in so\n——————\n  7 This  understanding of the Enabling Act has been the subject of sub\nstantial academic criticism, and rightfully so. See, e.g., Wright §4509,\nat 264, 269–270, 272; Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv.\nL. Rev. 693, 719 (1974) (hereinafter Ely); see also R. Fallon, J. Man\nning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s, The Federal\nCourts and the Federal System 593, n. 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing Ely).\n   8 JUSTICE SCALIA concedes as much, see ante, at 18–19, but argues\n\nthat insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might\nviolate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state\nrule, my approach is itself “unfaithful to the statute’s terms,” which\ncover “substantive rights” but not “procedural rules,” ante, at 19, n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my\ninterpretation of the Enabling Act—that courts must look to whether a\nfederal rule alters substantive rights in a given case—but simply to the\nway I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that\nregulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might\nactually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA’s objection, more\nover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears\nprocedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on\nappeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\nA rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really\nbe a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a\nclaim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a\ndefinition of the scope of the claim. These are the sorts of rules that\n10       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndoing ignores the balance that Congress struck between\nuniform rules of federal procedure and respect for a State’s\nconstruction of its own rights and remedies. It also ig\nnores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright\n§4509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially\ncreated rules displacing state substantive law.9\n——————\none might describe as “procedural,” but they nonetheless define sub\nstantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the\nfederal rule would have altered the State’s “substantive rights.”\n   9 The plurality’s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean\n\nthat no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State’s own\nrights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate\n“the manner and the means by which the litigants’ rights are enforced,”\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are\nmany ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State’s\nformulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,\nalthough in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a\ntemporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to\npromulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in\nsome instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi\nlarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could\neviscerate a critical aspect—albeit one that deals with how a right is\nenforced—of a State’s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal\nrule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages\nare reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state\ndamages cap. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA responds that some of these federal rules might be\ninvalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not “really\nregulat[e] procedure.” Ante, at 20, n. 13 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality’s\ntest really is. See n. 10, infra. The response is also limited to those\nrules that can be described as “regulat[ing]” substance, ante, at 13; it\ndoes not address those federal rules that alter the right at issue in the\nlitigation, see Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), only\nwhen they displace particular state laws. JUSTICE SCALIA speculates\nthat “Congress may well have accepted” the occasional alteration of\nsubstantive rights “as the price of a uniform system of federal proce\ndure.” Ante, at 20–21, n. 13. Were we forced to speculate about the\nbalance that Congress struck, I might very well agree. But no specula\ntion is necessary because Congress explicitly told us that federal rules\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed\neral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state\nlaw, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina\ntions about whether application of a given rule would\ndisplace a state determination about substantive rights.\nSee ante, at 15, 21–22, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an\nEnabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is\nmore taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA’s.10 But in any event,\nthat inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it\nmay not be easy to decide what is actually a “substantive\nright,” “the designations substantive and procedural be\ncome important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.”\nEly 723; see also Wright §4509, at 266. The question,\ntherefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on\nfederal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab\nlished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer\neasily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does\nnot give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of\nthe Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and\n\n——————\n“shall not” alter “any” substantive right. §2072(b).\n   10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28\n\nU. S. C. §2072 will displace a State’s definition of its own substantive\nrights. See Wright §4509, at 272 (observing that “unusual cases\noccasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state\nrule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state\nsubstantive rights”). JUSTICE SCALIA’s interpretation, moreover, is not\nmuch more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts’ having\nto evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal\nrule is really “procedural.” It is hard to know the answer to that\nquestion and especially hard to resolve it without considering the\nnature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.\nThe plurality’s “ ‘test’ is no test at all—in a sense, it is little more than\nthe statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce\ndural.” Id., §4509, at 264.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality\nmisreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in\nHanna, “shorthand formulations which have appeared in\nearlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that\nfrequently arise from oversimplification.” 380 U. S., at\n475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is\nfirst necessary to understand the issue that was before the\nCourt. The petitioner raised only the facial question\nwhether “Rules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this\ncourt” and not the specific question of “the obligation of\nfederal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.”11\n312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to\nconsider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12\n——————\n  11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not\n\nvalidly address subjects involving “important questions of policy,” Supp.\nBrief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of\nRespondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner\nargued only that “[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical\nexamination” is “a ‘substantive’ right forbidden by Congress” to be\naddressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “even though in\ntheory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation”). In\nthe petitioner’s own words, “[t]his contention. . . [did] not in itself\ninvolve the [applicable] law of Illinois,” ibid., and the petitioner in her\nbriefing referenced the otherwise applicable state law only “to show\nthat [she] was in a position to make the contention,” ibid., that is, to\nshow that the federal court was applying a federal rule and not, under\nthe Rules of Decision Act, applying state law, see id., at 3.\n  12 The plurality defends its view by including a long quote from two\n\nparagraphs of Sibbach. Ante, at 15–16. But the quoted passage of\nSibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may\n“deal with” particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality’s\nblock quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to\nthe resolution of the case because the matter at issue,\nrequiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to\n“substantive rights” under the Enabling Act. Although\nmost state rules bearing on the litigation process are\nadopted for some policy reason, few seemingly “proce\ndural” rules define the scope of a substantive right or\nremedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet\ning federal and state judgments about privacy interests.\nThose privacy concerns may have been weighty and in\nsome sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the\nscope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga\ntion. Thus, in response to the petitioner’s argument in\nSibbach that “substantive rights” include not only “rights\nsought to be adjudicated by the litigants” but also “general\nprinciple[s]” or “question[s] of public policy that the legis\nlature is able to pass upon,” id., at 2–3, we held that “the\nphrase ‘substantive rights’ ” embraces only state rights,\nsuch as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be\nenforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13–14. If the\nFederal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was\nsufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then\nperhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ\nent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14\n——————\nwhich the Court explained that the term “substantive rights” in the\nEnabling Act “certainly embraces such rights” as “rights conferred by\nlaw to be protected and enforced,” such as “the right not to be injured in\none’s person by another’s negligence” and “to redress [such] infraction.”\nIbid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right “to\nredress [an] infraction,” will depend on the state law that it displaces.\n   13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases “really regu\n\nlates procedure,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not “really regulat[e]\nprocedure” when it displaces those rare state rules that, although\n“procedural” in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the\nrights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is\nprocedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).\n  14 Although this Court’s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS.

Post, at 12. As explained above, I\nreadily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state\nrule that is “ ‘procedural’ in the ordinary sense of the\nterm,” S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently\ninterwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem\nedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the\nfederal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,\n\n——————\nlittle significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural\nfederal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state\nright; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the\nCourt. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach’s statement that the Ena\nbling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated\nby the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13–14, for the proposition that “a court, in\nmeasuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the\nEnabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the\nRule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from\nthe course it would follow in state courts,” 380 U. S., at 473. And most\nof our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame\nwork for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned\nSibbach at all but cited only Hanna. See, e.g., Burlington Northern R.\nCo. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 5 (1987).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA notes that in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.\nMurphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946), we used language that supported his\nview. See ante, at 13. But in that case, we contemplated only that the\nFederal Rule in question might have “incidental effects . . . upon the\nrights of litigants,” explaining that “[t]he fact that the application of\nRule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner’s rights to adjudication by\nthe district court for northern Mississippi” rather than southern Mis\nsissippi “will undoubtedly affect those rights.” 326 U. S., at 445–446.\nThere was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the\nrights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify the rights themselves.\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      15\n\n                          Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthis is not such a case.\nRule 23 Controls Class Certification\n  When the District Court in the case before us was asked\nto certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nsquarely governed the determination whether the court\nshould do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule\n23, therefore, must apply unless its application would\nabridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.\n  Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under\nstand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the\nquestion of class certification in this matter because New\nYork has made a substantive judgment that such a class\nshould not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.\nAlthough, as discussed infra, at 17–20, I do not accept the\ndissent’s view of §901(b), I also do not see how the dis\nsent’s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I\n——————\n   15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent’s premises that a class\n\ncannot be certified. The dissent contends that §901(b) is a damages\n“limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or “proscription,” post, at 12,\nn. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 “does not command that a particular remedy\nbe available when a party sues in a representative capacity,” post, at\n11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the\ndissent’s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question\nwhether petitioner may certify a class, and §901(b) would be relevant\nonly to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action\nlawsuit, may collect statutory damages.\n   It may be that if the dissent’s interpretation of §901(b) were correct,\nthis class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the\nfederal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6). But that\nissue was not raised in respondent’s motion to dismiss (from which the\ncase comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the\nCourt. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has “acknowledged\nthat its individual claim” is for less than the required amount in\ncontroversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what\nactual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court\nwere to adopt all of the dissent’s premises, I believe the correct disposi\ntion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of\nwhether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.\n16     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But that is\nnot what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule\nshould be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not\nfollow that courts may rewrite the rule.\n   At bottom, the dissent’s interpretation of Rule 23 seems\nto be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its\napplication would create no Erie problem. The dissent\nwould apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie\neven to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,\nand thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But\n“[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,\nthe question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,\nrelatively unguided Erie choice.” Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is\nsatisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro\ntect “state regulatory policies,” post, at 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach would,\nin my view, work an end run around Congress’ system of\nuniform federal rules, see 28 U. S. C. §2072, and our deci\nsion in Hanna. Federal courts can and should interpret\nfederal rules with sensitivity to “state prerogatives,” post,\nat 4; but even when “state interests . . . warrant our re\nspectful consideration,” post, at 8, federal courts cannot\nrewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly\nthat §901(b) is substantive and that class certification\nshould be denied, then they should argue within the Ena\nbling Act’s framework. Otherwise, “the Federal Rule\napplies regardless of contrary state law.” Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, n. 7; accord, Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

This inquiry is not always a simple one because\n“[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that\ncannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,”\nWright §4508, at 232–233, and almost “any rule can be\nsaid to have . . . ‘substantive effects,’ affecting society’s\ndistribution of risks and rewards,” Ely 724, n. 170. Faced\nwith a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition\nally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,\none can often argue that the state rule was really some\npart of the State’s definition of its rights or remedies.\n   In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling\nAct problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law\nis designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a\njudgment about how state courts ought to operate and not\na judgment about the scope of state-created rights and\nremedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal\ncourt system, there are costs involved in attempting to\ndiscover the true nature of a state procedural rule and\nallowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule\nthat appears to govern the same question. The mere\npossibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created\nright is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.\n   The text of CPLR §901(b) expressly and unambiguously\napplies not only to claims based on New York law but also\nto claims based on federal law or the law of any other\nState. And there is no interpretation from New York\ncourts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how\n§901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce\ndural in form, serves the function of defining New York’s\nrights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because\nlawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal\nclass actions well before New York passed §901(b) in 1975,\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is\ntrue, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited\namount of legislative history that can be read to suggest\nthat the New York officials who supported §901(b) wished\nto create a “limitation” on New York’s “statutory dam\nages.” Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is\nnot the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7–8\n(opinion of the Court).\n   The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de\nscribe a judgment that §901(b) would operate as a limita\ntion on New York’s statutory damages. In evaluating that\n——————\n   16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns\n\ncreate laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws\nwill apply only within their territory. See post, at 18–20. That is a true\nfact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent’s position. For\none thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if\nthere is no conflict between Rule 23 and §901(b), and the court can thus\napply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the\nonly question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471.      And that inquiry is different from the Rules of\nDecision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469–471.\n   The dissent’s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter\npreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that\nlaws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending\nupon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume\nthat “the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined\nwholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,” American\nBanana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the\ncontext of §901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes\nlittle sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing\nwhat people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed\nto the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.\nThus, §901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it\nstates that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New\nYork Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear\nclaims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims\nunder New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had\nwritten a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up\n§901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong\npresumption is to the contrary.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlegislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between\nprocedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem\ningly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the\nscope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost\nevery rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect\non the outcome of litigation, not every state rule “defines\nthe dimensions of [a] claim itself,” post, at 12. New York\nclearly crafted §901(b) with the intent that only certain\nlawsuits—those for which there were not statutory penal\nties—could be joined in class actions in New York courts.\nThat decision reflects a policy judgment about which\nlawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class\nform and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care\nfully outlines, see post, at 8–10, §901(b) was “apparently”\nadopted in response to fears that the class-action proce\ndure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to “ annihi\nlating punishment of the defendant.” V. Alexander, Prac\ntice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney’s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.\nCrompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,\n1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par\nticularly strong evidence that §901(b) serves to define who\ncan obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a\nclass would enlarge New York’s remedy. Any device that\nmakes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to\nrecover damages.\n   In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some\nopponents of a broad class-action device “argued that there\nwas no need to permit class actions in order to encourage\nlitigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an\naggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to\npursue a claim.” Id., at 211, 863 N. E. 2d, at 1015 (em\nphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely\nthat, for any number of reasons, New York courts should\nnot conduct trials in the class format when that format is\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunnecessary to motivate litigation.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG\nasserts that this could not be true because “suits seeking\nstatutory damages are arguably best suited to the class\ndevice because individual proof of actual damages is un\nnecessary.” Post, at 9–10. But some people believe that\nclass actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as\nthey join together slightly disparate claims or force courts\nto adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss\nthe possibility that New York legislators shared in those\nbeliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when\nit appeared to be unnecessary.\n   The legislative history of §901 thus reveals a classically\nprocedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims\nin New York courts (under any source of law) only when it\nis necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the\nclass tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula\ntion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for\nbriefs. There is of course a difference of degree between\nthose examples and class certification, but not a difference\nof kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical\neffect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but\nthat does not transform it into a damages “proscription,”\npost, at 12, n. 6, 21, or “limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,\n25.18\n——————\n   17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature\n\nwould create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply\nonly when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a\nlawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to\nsee how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York’s\npenalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or\nindividual, and that §901(b) addresses penalties that are created under\nany source of state or federal law.\n   18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter\n\nwould “transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.” Post, at 1. But\nin fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one\n$5,000,000 case. It may be that without class certification, not all of\nthe potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  21\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n  The difference of degree is relevant to the forum shop\nping considerations that are part of the Rules of Decision\nAct or Erie inquiry. If the applicable federal rule did not\ngovern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly\nread not to do so), then those considerations would matter,\nfor precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See post, at\n17–24. But that is not this case. As the Court explained\nin Hanna, it is an “incorrect assumption that the rule of\nErie R. Co. v. Thompkins constitutes the appropriate test\nof . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure.” 380 U. S., at 469–470. “It is true that both the\nEnabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal\ncourts are to apply state ‘substantive’ law and federal\n‘procedural’ law,” but the tests are different and reflect the\nfact that “they were designed to control very different\nsorts of decisions.” Id., at 471.\n  Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only\ndecision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case\nwould “abridge, enlarge or modify” New York’s substantive\nrights or remedies. §2072(b). Although one can argue\nthat class certification would enlarge New York’s “limited”\ndamages remedy, see post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, such\narguments rest on extensive speculation about what the\nNew York Legislature had in mind when it created\n§901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing\nnarratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect\nthe plain textual reading of §901(b), a rule in New York’s\nprocedural code about when to certify class actions\nbrought under any source of law, and respect Congress’\ndecision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal\ncourts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be\nmore than just a possibility that the state rule is different\n—————— \n\nprocedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located\n\ncourthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other fea\n\ntures of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue. \n\n22     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state\ncourt, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York\nIns. Law Ann. §5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over\ndue benefits would, by Shady Grove’s own measure,\namount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal\ncourt based on the parties’ diverse citizenship and request\ning class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for\nthe class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.\nThe New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in\nstructing that, unless specifically permitted, “an action to\nrecover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre\nated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a\nclass action.” N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) §901(b)\n(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures\nfor the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts\nthe application of §901(b) in diversity suits.\n  The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New\nYork’s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.\n2        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Center for Humani\nties, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427 (1996); see Erie R. Co. v.\nTompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Justice Harlan aptly\nconveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described Erie\nas “one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism,\nexpressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of\njudicial power between the state and federal systems.”\nHanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 474 (1965) (concurring\nopinion). Although we have found Erie’s application\n“sometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor,” Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.\n   The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal\ncourts from generating substantive law in diversity ac\ntions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as\npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a\npolicy of prime importance to our federal system. We have\n——————\n  1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, “[t]he laws of the several\n\nstates, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or\nActs of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in\ncases where they apply.” 28 U.

York, 326\nU. S. 99, 110 (1945).\n  The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,\nauthorizes us to “prescribe general rules of practice and\nprocedure” for the federal courts, but with a crucial re\nstriction: “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.” 28 U. S. C. §2072. Pursuant to\nthis statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ\ning, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the\nlimits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard\nCorp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act\ncounsels against “adventurous application” of Rule 23; any\ntension with the Act “is best kept within tolerable limits.”);\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613\n(1997). See also Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin\nCorp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001).\n  If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts\nwith state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with\nthe Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 469–474. If, however, no Federal\nRule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision\nAct, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs\nfederal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when\nfailure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield\nmarkedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing\nthat the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act\nsimultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we\nhave endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within\nthe bounds of both congressional directives.\n                              B\n   In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men\ntioned in the Court’s opinion, we have avoided immoderate\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Armco Steel\nCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1980) (quoting Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472). To displace state law, a Federal Rule,\n“when fairly construed,” must be “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” so\nas “to ‘control the issue’ before the court, thereby leaving\nno room for the operation of that law.” Burlington North\nern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987) (quoting\nWalker, 446 U. S., at 749–750, and n. 9; emphasis added);\ncf. Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22,\n37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]n deciding\nwhether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a\nparticular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi\ncant disuniformity between state and federal courts\nshould be avoided if the text permits.”).\n   In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the\nFederal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer\nv. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the\nCourt read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de\nfenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed\ndefenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in\nsuch cases, Palmer held, state law controls.\n   Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &\nWarehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that\nstate law determines when a diversity suit commences for\npurposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although\nFederal Rule 3 specified that “[a] civil action is commenced\nby filing a complaint with the court,” we held that the\nRule did not displace a state law that tied an action’s\ncommencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531–\n533. The “cause of action [wa]s created by local law,” the\nCourt explained, therefore “the measure of it [wa]s to be\nfound only in local law.” Id., at 533.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver\nsity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq\nuisite to pursuit of a stockholder’s derivative action, to\npost a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga\ntion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff’s insti\ntution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the\nFederal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder’s\nmaintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no\nconflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques\ntion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court\nobserved. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for\ncosts requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors\ncould not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the\nfederal court’s diversity jurisdiction.\n   In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, “the\nscope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing\nparty urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule\nwhich covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the\nenforcement of state law.” 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna\nitself, the Court found the clash “unavoidable,” ibid.; the\npetitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by\nFederal Rule 4(d)(1), but that “how-to” method did not\nsatisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service\non an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the\nMassachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce\ndure, however, “[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .\nthat federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts\napplying them, and that the process of interpretation can\nand should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter\nests.” R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,\nHart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal\nSystem 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).\n   Following Hanna, we continued to “interpre[t] the fed\neral rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory\npolicies.” Hart & Wechsler 593. In Walker, the Court took\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS.

S., at 749–752. Rule 3, we said, addresses\nonly “the date from which various timing requirements of\nthe Federal Rules begin to run,” id., at 751, and does not\n“purpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,” id., at 750–751.\nSignificant state policy interests would be frustrated, we\nobserved, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state\nrule, which required actual service on the defendant to\nstop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750–\n752.\n   We were similarly attentive to a State’s regulatory\npolicy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the\nstandard for determining when the large size of a jury\nverdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts\nalike had generally employed a “shock the conscience” test\nin reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,\nat 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule\n59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed\nthat a trial court could grant a new trial “for any of the\nreasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted\nin actions at law in the courts of the United States.” Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide\ngreater control, New York prescribed procedures under\nwhich jury verdicts would be examined to determine\nwhether they “deviate[d] materially from what would be\nreasonable compensation.” See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n423–425 (quoting CPLR §5501(c)). This Court held that\nRule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of\nNew York’s invigorated test.\n   Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim\npreclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a\ndiversity action on the basis of a California statute of\nlimitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

(Plaintiff chose Maryland because\nthat State’s limitations period had not yet run.) We held\nthat Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun\ntary dismissal “operate[d] as an adjudication on the mer\nits,” did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in\nMaryland.

Yet\ntoday, the Court gives no quarter to New York’s limitation\non statutory damages and requires the lower courts to\nthwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive\ndamages, New York’s law controls the penalty to which a\ndefendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story\nbehind §901(b)’s enactment deserves telling.\n   In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New\nYork proposed a new class-action statute designed “to set\nup a flexible, functional scheme” that would provide “an\neffective, but controlled group remedy.” Judicial Confer\nence Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws\npp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the\nlegislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class\nactions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for\ncertification, eventually codified at §901(a), that closely\ntracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR §901(a) (requir\ning, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,\ntypicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).\n   While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New\nYork Legislature’s hopper, “various groups advocated for\nthe addition of a provision that would prohibit class action\nplaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty\n——————\nmirror reality, as I later explain.

In this regard, it is immaterial that\n§901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than\nretail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have\nembedded the limitation in every provision creating a\ncause of action for which a penalty is authorized; §901(b)\noperates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a\npart of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be\nwere it included claim by claim in the New York Code.\n  The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit\n“may” or “may not” be maintained as a class action. See\nante, at 4–6. Putting the question that way, the Court\ndoes not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes\nclass treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be\ncause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and\nefficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section\n901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does\nnot allow class members to recover statutory damages\nbecause the New York Legislature considered the result of\nadjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The\nfair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti\nmate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of\nstate law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State’s\nlawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The\nIrrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L.

On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme\ndies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit.

Wilson & Co., 312 U.

[a] substantive right” in violation of the\nRules Enabling Act. 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). The plurality appears to\nacknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found\nto be in compliance with the Act have not “altered . . . available reme\ndies.” Ante, at 13. But the Court’s relentless reading of Rule 23 today\ndoes exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of\nclass-size statutory damages even though the New York provision\ninstructs that such penalties shall not be available.\n  8 The Court states that “[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect\n\nour perception of legislative purpose.” Ante, at 9. But we can, of\ncourse, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State’s regulatory policy\nto decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See\nsupra, at 3–7.

In sum,\nwhile phrased as responsive to the question whether\ncertain class actions may begin, §901(b) is unmistakably\naimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that\nremedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.\n  Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves §901(b) in control of\nthe remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis\npelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which\ncounsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions\nagainst stretching a rule to cover every situation it could\nconceivably reach.10 The Court states that “[t]here is no\nreason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether\nclaims made eligible for class treatment by some other law\nshould be certified as class actions.” Ante, at 5.

That is plainly so\non a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there\nany reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief\nwhen the State that created the remedy disallows its\npursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our\nfederal system should give.\n  Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain\npenalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class\nrelief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for\ncertain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum\nrecovery.

S., at 428.\n    Seeking to pretermit that inquiry, Shady Grove urges\nthat the class-action bar in §901(b) must be regarded as\n“procedural” because it is contained in the CPLR, which\n“govern[s] the procedure in civil judicial proceedings in all\ncourts of the state.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (quoting CPLR\n§101; emphasis in original). Placement in the CPLR is\nhardly dispositive. The provision held “substantive” for\nErie purposes in Gasperini is also contained in the CPLR\n(§5501(c)), as are limitations periods, §201 et seq., pre\nscriptions plainly “substantive” for Erie purposes however\nthey may be characterized for other purposes, see York,\n326 U. S., at 109–112. See also, e.g., 1 Restatement (Sec\nond) of Conflict of Laws §133, Reporter’s Note, p. 369\n(1969) (hereinafter Restatement) (“Under the rule of Erie\n. . . the federal courts have classified the burden of persua\nsion as to contributory negligence as a matter of substan\ntive law that is governed by the rule of the State in which\nthey sit even though the courts of that State have charac\nterized their rule as procedural for choice-of-law pur\nposes.”); Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict\nof Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333 (1933).\n    Shady Grove also ranks §901(b) as “procedural” because\n“nothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to\nrights of action based on New York state law, as opposed\nto federal law or the law of other states”; instead it “ap\n18      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But neither is it expressly\nextended to claims arising under foreign law. The rule\nprescribes, without elaboration either way, that “an action\nto recover a penalty . . . may not be maintained as a class\naction.” We have often recognized that “general words”\nappearing in a statute may, in fact, have limited applica\ntion; “[t]he words ‘any person or persons,’ ” for example,\n“are broad enough to comprehend every human being.\nBut general words must not only be limited to cases within\nthe jurisdiction of the state, but also to those objects to\nwhich the legislature intended to apply them.” United\nStates v.

The article centers on a now-archaic Massa\nchusetts law that prevented married women from binding\nthemselves by contract as sureties for their husbands.\nDiscussing whether the Massachusetts prescription ap\nplied to transactions involving foreign factors (a foreign\nforum, foreign place of contracting, or foreign parties),\nCurrie observed:\n     “When the Massachusetts legislature addresses itself\n     to the problem of married women as sureties, the un\n     developed image in its mind is that of Massachusetts\n     married women, husbands, creditors, transactions,\n     courts, and judgments.

Rev. 227, 231 (1958) (emphasis added).\nShady Grove’s suggestion that States must specifically\nlimit their laws to domestic rights of action if they wish\ntheir enactments to apply in federal diversity litigation\nmisses the obvious point: State legislators generally do not\nfocus on an interstate setting when drafting statutes.12\n——————\n   12 Shady Grove’s argument that §901(b) is procedural based on its\n\npossible application to foreign claims is also out of sync with our Erie\ndecisions, many of them involving state statutes of similarly unquali\nfied scope. The New Jersey law at issue in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus\ntrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 544, n. 1 (1949), for example, required\nplaintiffs to post a bond as security for costs in “any [stockholder’s\nderivative] action.” (quoting 1945 N. J.

S. C. §227, see Rudgayzer & Gratt v. Cape Canaveral\nTour & Travel, Inc., 22 App. Div. 3d 148, 799 N. Y. S. 2d\n795 (2005), thus revealing §901(b)’s “procedural” cast.\nBrief for Petitioner 36. We note first that the TCPA itself\ncalls for the application of state law. See Rudgayzer, 22\nApp. Div. 3d, at 149–150, 799 N. Y. S. 2d, at 796–797\n(federal action authorized in state court “if otherwise\npermitted by the laws or rules of the court of [the] State”\n(quoting 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3))). See also Gottlieb v.\nCarnival Corp., 436 F. 3d 335, 342 (CA2 2006) (Sotomayor,\nJ.) (“Congress sought, via the TCPA, to enact the func\ntional equivalent of a state law.”). The TCPA, the Su\npreme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus “carves\nout an exception to th[e] general rule” that “when Erie . . .\nis reversed . . . , a state court hearing a federal case is\nnormally required to apply federal substantive law”: “Un\nder §227(b)(3) . . . it is state substantive law that deter\nmines, as a preliminary matter, whether a federal action\nunder the act may be brought in state court.” Weber v.\nU.

Stat.,\nTit. 12, §97 (1971)). Our characterization of a state statute as substan\ntive for Erie purposes has never hinged on whether the law applied only\nto domestic causes of action. To the contrary, we have ranked as\nsubstantive a variety of state laws that the state courts apply to federal\nand out-of-state claims, including statutes of limitations and burden-of\nproof prescriptions. See infra, at 21.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Moreover, statutes qualify as “substantive” for Erie\npurposes even when they have “procedural” thrusts as\nwell. See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U. S., at 555; cf. Woods v. Inter\nstate Realty Co., 337 U. S. 535, 536–538, and n. 1 (1949)\n(holding diversity case must be dismissed based on state\nstatute that, by its terms, governed only proceedings in\nstate court). Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.\nThey supply “substantive” law in diversity suits, see York,\n326 U. S., at 109–112, even though, as Shady Grove ac\nknowledges, state courts often apply the forum’s limita\ntions period as a “procedural” bar to claims arising under\nthe law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 16–17. See also Restatement §§142–143 (when\nadjudicating a foreign cause of action, State may use\neither its own or the foreign jurisdiction’s statute of limi\ntations, whichever is shorter). Similarly, federal courts\nsitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the\nburden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 177 (1943), yet state courts adju\ndicating foreign causes of action often apply their own\nlocal law to this issue. See Restatement §133 and Re\nporter’s Note.\n   In short, Shady Grove’s effort to characterize §901(b) as\nsimply “procedural” cannot successfully elide this funda\nmental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of\nan issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the\nsense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the\nRules of Decision Act commands application of the State’s\nlaw in diversity suits. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9; York, 326 U. S., at 109. As\nthis case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising\ndiversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award\nstatutory penalties in class actions while New York courts\nare bound by §901(b)’s proscription, “substantial varia\ntions between state and federal [money judgments] may be\nexpected.” Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 430 (quoting Hanna,\n22        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                    v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n380 U. S., at 467–468 (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThe “variation” here is indeed “substantial.” Shady Grove\nseeks class relief that is ten thousand times greater than\nthe individual remedy available to it in state court. As the\nplurality acknowledges, ante, at 22, forum shopping will\nundoubtedly result if a plaintiff need only file in federal\ninstead of state court to seek a massive monetary award\nexplicitly barred by state law. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n431 (“Erie precludes a recovery in federal court signifi\ncantly larger than the recovery that would have been\ntolerated in state court.”).13 The “accident of diversity of\ncitizenship,” Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S.\n487, 496 (1941), should not subject a defendant to such\naugmented liability. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at 467 (“The\nErie rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be\nunfair for the character or result of a litigation materially\nto differ because the suit had been brought in a federal\ncourt.”).\n   It is beyond debate that “a statutory cap on damages\nwould supply substantive law for Erie purposes.”\nGasperini, 518 U. S., at 428. See also id., at 439–440\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“A state-law ceiling on allowable\ndamages . . . is a substantive rule of decision that federal\ncourts must apply in diversity cases governed by New\nYork law.”); id., at 464 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“State\nsubstantive law controls what injuries are compensable\nand in what amount.”). In Gasperini, we determined that\nNew York’s standard for measuring the alleged excessive\n——————\n  13 In contrast, many “state rules ostensibly addressed to procedure,”\nante, at 10 (majority opinion)—including pleading standards and rules\ngoverning summary judgment, pretrial discovery, and the admissibility\nof certain evidence—would not so hugely impact forum choices. It is\ndifficult to imagine a scenario that would promote more forum shopping\nthan one in which the difference between filing in state and federal\ncourt is the difference between a potential award of $500 and one of\n$5,000,000.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The statute was\nframed as “a procedural instruction,” we noted, “but the\nState’s objective [wa]s manifestly substantive.” Ibid.\n    Gasperini’s observations apply with full force in this\ncase. By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a\nclass action, §901(b) controls a defendant’s maximum\nliability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial\nprovision could have been written as an explicit cap: “In\nany class action seeking statutory damages, relief is lim\nited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recov\nered in an individual suit.” That New York’s Legislature\nused other words to express the very same meaning\nshould be inconsequential.\n    We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,\nin a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created\nremedies. See Woods, 337 U. S., at 538 (in a diversity\ncase, a plaintiff “barred from recovery in the state court\n. . . should likewise be barred in the federal court”); York,\n326 U. S., at 108–109 (federal court sitting in diversity\n“cannot afford recovery if the right to recover is made\nunavailable by the State nor can it substantively affect the\nenforcement of the right as given by the State”). Just as\nErie precludes a federal court from entering a deficiency\njudgment when a State has “authoritatively announced\nthat [such] judgments cannot be secured within its bor\nders,” Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S. 183, 191 (1947), so too\nErie should prevent a federal court from awarding statu\ntory penalties aggregated through a class action when\nNew York prohibits this recovery. See also Ragan, 337\nU. S., at 533 (“Where local law qualifies or abridges [a\nclaim], the federal court must follow suit. Otherwise there\nis a different measure of the cause of action in one court\nthan in the other, and the principle of Erie . . . is trans\ngressed.”).

S. C. §1332(d). In\nCAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law\nbased class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,\nat least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in\ncontroversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress\nsought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness\nof some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 109–14, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers\nfrom “gam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide\nor multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges\nhave reputations for readily certifying classes.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving “the ‘I\nnever met a class action I didn’t like’ approach to class\ncertification” that “is prevalent in state courts in some\nlocalities”). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer—\nnot more—class actions overall. Congress surely never\nanticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a mecca\nfor suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched: class\nactions seeking state-created penalties for claims arising\nunder state law—claims that would be barred from class\ntreatment in the State’s own courts.

S., at\n426. There is no risk that individual plaintiffs seeking statutory\npenalties will flood federal courts with state-law claims that could be\nmanaged more efficiently on a class basis; the diversity statute’s\namount-in-controversy requirement ensures that small state-law\ndisputes remain in state court.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Argued November 2, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010\nAfter respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New\n  York law on petitioner Shady Grove’s insurance claim, Shady Grove\n  filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it\n  and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal\n  Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of\n  jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which precludes a\n  class action to recover a “penalty” such as statutory interest. Affirm\n  ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in\n  compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.

Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court\n  of Appeals held that §901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting\n  in diversity because it is “substantive” within the meaning of Erie R.\n  Co. v.

Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) If Rule 23 answers the question in dispute, it governs here\n  unless it exceeds its statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemak\n  ing power. Burlington Northern R. Co. v.

CO.\n                            Syllabus\n\n       (b) Rule 23(b) answers the question in dispute—whether Shady\n    Grove’s suit may proceed as a class action—when it states that “[a]\n    class action may be maintained” if certain conditions are met. Since\n    §901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady\n    Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as a class action” because of the\n    relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless\n    Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit’s view that §901(b) and\n    Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil\n    ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23\n    explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case\n    meeting its criteria. Allstate’s arguments based on the exclusion of\n    some federal claims from Rule 23’s reach pursuant to federal statutes\n    and on §901’s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4–6.\n       (c) The dissent’s claim that §901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be\n    cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is\n    foreclosed by §901(b)’s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.\n    The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to\n    avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), does\n    not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent’s approach does not\n    avoid a conflict between §901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren\n    der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6–12.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II–B and II–D:\n       (a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072, not Erie, controls\n    the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)’s re\n    quirement that federal procedural rules “not abridge, enlarge or mod\n    ify any substantive right” means that a Rule must “really regulat[e]\n    procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec\n    ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and\n    redress for disregard or infraction of them,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n    312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party’s\n    rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing\n    those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,\n    or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that\n    criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\n    separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate’s arguments\n    asserting §901(b)’s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the\n    substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat\n    ters, but that of the Federal Rule.

Examples\n  may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to\n  bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of\n  recovery.

As partial payment for that care, Galvez\nassigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits\nunder a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance\nCo. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene­\nfits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to\npay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. §5106(a)\n(West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time,\nand it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on\nthe overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see ibid.\n   Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York to recover the unpaid statutory in­\nterest.

The District Court dismissed the suit for\nlack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It rea­\nsoned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which pre­\ncludes a suit to recover a “penalty” from proceeding as a\nclass action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,\ndespite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding\nthat statutory interest is a “penalty” under New York law,\nit held that §901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.\nAnd, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim\n(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in­\ncontroversy requirement for individual suits under 28\nU. S. C. §1332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The\ncourt did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com­\npliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072,\nwould control if it conflicted with §901(b). But there was\nno conflict because (as we will describe in more detail\nbelow) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and\n§901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule\non point, the Court of Appeals held that §901(b) is “sub­\nstantive” within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U. S. 64 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal\ncourts sitting in diversity.\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n   The framework for our decision is familiar. We must\nfirst determine whether Rule 23 answers the question in\ndispute. Burlington Northern R. Co. v.

CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\n4–5 (1987). If it does, it governs—New York’s law not­\nwithstanding—unless it exceeds statutory authorization or\nCongress’s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.\nPlumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463–464 (1965). We do not wade\ninto Erie’s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli­\ncable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469–471.\n                              A\n   The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove’s suit\nmay proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an­\nswer. It states that “[a] class action may be maintained” if\ntwo conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria\nset forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also\nmust fit into one of the three categories described in sub­\ndivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this\ncreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit\nmeets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class\naction. (The Federal Rules regularly use “may” to confer\ncategorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n8(d)(2)–(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)–(b), 20(a)(1)–(2), 27(a)(1),\n30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural\nentitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–5(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all\nformula for deciding the class-action question. Because\n§901(b) attempts to answer the same question—i.e., it\nstates that Shady Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as\na class action” (emphasis added) because of the relief it\nseeks—it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.\n   The Second Circuit believed that §901(b) and Rule 23 do\nnot conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,\nit said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether\na given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on\nthe other hand, addresses an antecedent question:\nwhether the particular type of claim is eligible for class\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                 the Court\n\ntreatment in the first place—a question on which Rule 23\nis silent. See 549 F. 3d, at 143–144. Allstate embraces\nthis analysis. Brief for Respondent 12–13.\n   We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility\nand certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi­\ntions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that\neligibility must depend on the “particular cause of action”\nasserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at\n12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro­\nvide that only claims involving more than a certain num­\nber of plaintiffs are “eligible” for class treatment in federal\ncourt. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)’s prerequi­\nsites “eligibility criteria” would obviate Allstate’s objec­\ntion—a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc­\ntion is made-to-order.\n   There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as\naddressing only whether claims made eligible for class\ntreatment by some other law should be certified as class\nactions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly\nnor implicitly empowers a federal court “to certify a class\nin each and every case” where the Rule’s criteria are met.\nId., at 13–14. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It\nsays that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied “[a]\nclass action may be maintained” (emphasis added)—not “a\nclass action may be permitted.” Courts do not maintain\nactions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23’s\n“may” is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring\nhis claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati\ncally applies “in all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699–700 (1979).\n   Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some\nfederal claims from Rule 23’s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(e)(1)(B)—which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule\n23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\nrather leaves room for laws like §901(b). But Congress,\nunlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an\nindividual rule as it sees fit—either by directly amending\nthe rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in\ncertain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517\nU. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created\nspecific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule\ndoes not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If\nRule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,\nthe statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.\n  Allstate next suggests that the structure of §901 shows\nthat Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),\nit notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly\nanalogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that\nsubsection is pre-empted). But §901(b)’s rule barring class\nactions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,\nand where it applies §901(a) does not. This shows, accord­\ning to Allstate, that §901(b) concerns a separate subject.\nPerhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub­\nject of §901(a). But the question before us is whether it\nconcerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23—\nand for purposes of answering that question the way New\nYork has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23\npermits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a\nState cannot limit that permission by structuring one part\nof its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part\nthat imposes additional requirements. Both of §901’s\nsubsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule\n23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.\nCf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7–8.\n  The dissent argues that §901(b) has nothing to do with\nwhether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class\naction, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.\nSee post, at 8–17 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Whereas\n“Rule 23 governs procedural aspects of class litigation” by\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Accordingly, the dissent says,\nRule 23 and New York’s law may coexist in peace.\n   We need not decide whether a state law that limits the\nremedies available in an existing class action would con­\nflict with Rule 23; that is not what §901(b) does. By its\nterms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from “main­\ntain[ing]” a class action seeking statutory penalties.\nUnlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other\nremedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,\n§901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may\naward; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming\ninto existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by\n§901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu­\ntory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in\nadvance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the\nevent the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the\nstatute’s clear prohibition on “maintain[ing]” such suits as\nclass actions.\n   The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid §901(b)’s\nbarrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a\nrequest for statutory penalties. See post, at 14–15. Even\nassuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact\n——————\n   4 Contrary to the dissent’s implication, post, at 13, we express no view\n\nas to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a\nsingle suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.\nWhether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, §901(b) does conflict\nbecause it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main­\ntain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal\nstatutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. §2605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.\n§1854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal\nRules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case\nof a conflict.\n   5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737\n8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                the Court\n\nthat a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class\naction would not at all prove that §901(b) is addressed\nonly to remedies. If the state law instead banned class\nactions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff\ncould drop the fraud counts from his complaint and pro­\nceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would\nnot mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban\nwould affect only the procedural means by which the\nremedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent\ncorrectly abandons Allstate’s eligibility-certifiability dis­\ntinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.\n  The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of\n§901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23—i.e., whether\na class action may be maintained—but insists the provi­\nsion’s purpose is to restrict only remedies. See post, at 12–\n15; post, at 15 (“[W]hile phrased as responsive to the\nquestion whether certain class actions may begin, §901(b)\nis unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions\nmust end”). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further proce­\ndural fairness and efficiency, §901(b) (we are told) “re­\nsponds to an entirely different concern”: the fear that\nallowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide\nbasis would “produce overkill.” Post, at 12, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent reaches this con­\nclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in\nthe law’s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the\nLegislature “apparently fear[ed]” that combining class\nactions and statutory penalties “could result in annihilat­\ning punishment of the defendant,” V.

Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863\nN. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).\n  This evidence of the New York Legislature’s purpose is\npretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent’s account of\nthe Legislature’s objective at face value, it cannot override\nthe statute’s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the\nremedy a plaintiff can obtain, §901(b) achieves that end by\nlimiting a plaintiff’s power to maintain a class action. The\nmanner in which the law “could have been written,” post,\nat 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla­\nture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our\nperception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U.

Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),\ndiscussed by the dissent, post, at 5–6, 13–14, n. 8, is not to the contrary.\nThere we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is\n“ ‘commenced’ ” by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a\nstate law providing that “ ‘[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,\nwithin the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each\ndefendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .’ ”\n446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, §97 (1971); altera­\ntion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, “governs the\ndate from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules\nbegin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations” or tolling\nrules, which it did not “purpor[t] to displace.” 446 U. S., at 751, 750.\nThe texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed\nthat the State’s actual-service rule was (in the State’s judgment) an\n“integral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita­\ntions,” id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court\nmay resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal\nrules by resorting to the state law’s ostensible objectives.\n10     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

It would\nalso mean that district courts would have to discern, in\nevery diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively\npre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely\nconflicts with federal law. That task will often prove\narduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the\naim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to\nthe extent the dissent’s purpose-driven approach depends\non its characterization of §901(b)’s aims as substantive, it\nwould apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to\nprocedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody\npolicy preferences about the types of claims that should\nsucceed—as do rules governing summary judgment, pre­\ntrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.\nHard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state\nsupreme court’s pronouncement of the law’s purpose\nwould settle the issue, since existence of the factual predi­\ncate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a fed­\neral question. Predictably, federal judges would be con­\ndemned to poring through state legislative history—which\nmay be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less famil­\niar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky & D. Dunn,\nFundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Tor­\nres & Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, An­\nnotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib.

The central difficulty is that even artificial\nnarrowing cannot render §901(b) compatible with Rule 23.\nWhatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict\neach other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see\npost, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in\na manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat­\nute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings—one\nthat would violate §2072(b) and another that would not—\nwe would agree. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 842, 845 (1999); cf. Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed\nMartin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001). But it is not.\nRule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any\nfederal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the\nRule’s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text,\neven to avert a collision with state law that might render\n——————\n  7 The    dissent also suggests that we should read the Federal Rules\n“ ‘with sensitivity to important state interests’ ” and “ ‘to avoid conflict\nwith important state regulatory policies.’ ” Post, at 7 (quoting Gasperini\nv. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427, n. 7, 438, n. 22\n(1996)). The search for state interests and policies that are “important”\nis just as standardless as the “important or substantial” criterion we\nrejected in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), to define\nthe state-created rights a Federal Rule may not abridge.\n   If all the dissent means is that we should read an ambiguous Federal\nRule to avoid “substantial variations [in outcomes] between state and\nfederal litigation,” Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S.\n497, 504 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), we entirely agree.\nWe should do so not to avoid doubt as to the Rule’s validity—since a\nFederal Rule that fails Erie’s forum-shopping test is not ipso facto\ninvalid, see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469–472 (1965)—but\nbecause it is reasonable to assume that “Congress is just as concerned\nas we have been to avoid significant differences between state and\nfederal courts in adjudicating claims,” Stewart Organization, Inc. v.\nRicoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22, 37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The\nassumption is irrelevant here, however, because there is only one\nreasonable reading of Rule 23.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nit invalid. See Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740,\n750, n. 9 (1980).8 What the dissent’s approach achieves is\nnot the avoiding of a “conflict between Rule 23 and\n§901(b),” post, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23\n(pursuant to §2072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the\nextent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of\n§901. There is no other way to reach the dissent’s destina­\ntion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule\n23 falls within the statutory authorization.\n                               B\n   Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts\nto supplant state law with judge-made rules. In that\ncontext, it made no difference whether the rule was tech­\nnically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was\nwhether it “significantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.”\nGuaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That\nis not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu­\ntory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has\nundoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted\npower to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so\nlong as those rules regulate matters “rationally capable of\nclassification” as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In\nthe Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28\nU. S. C. §2072(a), but with the limitation that those rules\n“shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive\nright,” §2072(b).\n   We have long held that this limitation means that the\nRule must “really regulat[e] procedure,—the judicial\n——————\n   8 The cases chronicled by the dissent, see post, at 3–8, each involved a\n\nFederal Rule that we concluded could fairly be read not to “control the\nissue” addressed by the pertinent state law, thus avoiding a “direct\ncollision” between federal and state law, Walker, 446 U. S., at 749\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But here, as in Hanna, supra, at\n470, a collision is “unavoidable.”\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 14; see Hanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480\nU. S., at 8. The test is not whether the rule affects a\nlitigant’s substantive rights; most procedural rules do.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438,\n445 (1946). What matters is what the rule itself regulates:\nIf it governs only “the manner and the means” by which\nthe litigants’ rights are “enforced,” it is valid; if it alters\n“the rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate\n[those] rights,” it is not. Id., at 446 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Applying that test, we have rejected every statutory\nchallenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us. We\nhave found to be in compliance with §2072(b) rules pre­\nscribing methods for serving process, see id., at 445–446\n(Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(f)); Hanna, supra, at 463–465 (Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(d)(1)), and requiring litigants whose\nmental or physical condition is in dispute to submit to\nexaminations, see Sibbach, supra, at 14–16 (Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 35); Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 113–\n114 (1964) (same). Likewise, we have upheld rules au­\nthorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file\nfrivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed. Rule\nApp. Proc. 38), or who sign court papers without a reason­\nable inquiry into the facts asserted, see Business Guides,\nInc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498\nU. S. 533, 551–554 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11). Each\nof these rules had some practical effect on the parties’\nrights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for\nenforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,\nthe available remedies, or the rules of decision by which\nthe court adjudicated either.\n   Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules\nallowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi­\n14      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                  v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nple parties) to be litigated together are also valid. See,\ne.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder\nof parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules\nneither change plaintiffs’ separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants’ rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23—at\nleast insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\nseparate claims against the same defendants in a class\naction—falls within §2072(b)’s authorization. A class\naction, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a\nspecies), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate\nclaims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate\nsuits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties’\nlegal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision\nunchanged.\n   Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions\nis not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue\non behalf of a class “transform[s] [the] dispute over a five\nhundred dollar penalty into a dispute over a five million\ndollar penalty.” Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate’s aggre­\ngate liability, however, does not depend on whether the\nsuit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus\nmembers of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl­\nedges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual\nclaim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who\nwould not bring individual suits for the relatively small\nsums involved will choose to join a class action. That has\nno bearing, however, on Allstate’s or the plaintiffs’ legal\nrights. The likelihood that some (even many) plaintiffs\nwill be induced to sue by the availability of a class action\nis just the sort of “incidental effec[t]” we have long held\ndoes not violate §2072(b), Mississippi Publishing, supra,\nat 445.\n   Allstate argues that Rule 23 violates §2072(b) because\nthe state law it displaces, §901(b), creates a right that\nthe Federal Rule abridges—namely, a “substantive\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nright . . . not to be subjected to aggregated class-action\nliability” in a single suit. Brief for Respondent 31. To\nbegin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of\n§901(b) (which is to be found in New York’s procedural\ncode) confines it to claims under New York law; and of\ncourse New York has no power to alter substantive rights\nand duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,\nthe consequence of excluding certain class actions may be\nto cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,\nbut the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,\n§901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple\njoinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even\nif §901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted “for\nsubstantive reasons,” id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end\nwas not to improve “the conduct of the litigation process\nitself” but to alter “the outcome of that process.” Id., at 26.\n   The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is\nthat the substantive nature of New York’s law, or its\nsubstantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule\nof Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid\nin others—or valid in some cases and invalid in others—\ndepending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state\nsubstantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for\nsubstantive purposes). That could not be clearer in\nSibbach:\n    “The petitioner says the phrase [‘substantive rights’ in\n    the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use\n    Congress intended that in regulating procedure this\n    Court should not deal with important and substantial\n    rights theretofore recognized. Recognized where and\n    by whom? The state courts are divided as to the\n    power in the absence of statute to order a physical ex­\n    amination.

If we were to\n     adopt the suggested criterion of the importance of the\n     alleged right we should invite endless litigation and\n     confusion worse confounded.        The test must be\n     whether a rule really regulates procedure . . . .” 312\n     U. S., at 13–14 (footnotes omitted).\nHanna unmistakably expressed the same understanding\nthat compliance of a Federal Rule with the Enabling Act is\nto be assessed by consulting the Rule itself, and not its\neffects in individual applications:\n     “[T]he court has been instructed to apply the Federal\n     Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory\n     Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their\n     prima facie judgment that the Rule in question trans­\n     gresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor con­\n     stitutional restrictions.” 380 U. S., at 471.\n   In sum, it is not the substantive or procedural nature or\npurpose of the affected state law that matters, but the\nsubstantive or procedural nature of the Federal Rule. We\nhave held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that\nthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon\nwhether it regulates procedure. See Sibbach, supra, at 14;\nHanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480 U. S., at 8. If it\ndoes, it is authorized by §2072 and is valid in all jurisdic­\ntions, with respect to all claims, regardless of its incidental\neffect upon state-created rights.\n                           C\n  A few words in response to the concurrence. We under­\nstand it to accept the framework we apply—which re­\nquires first, determining whether the federal and state\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Post, at\n5–7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23\nand §901(b) conflict, post, at 15–16, and departs from us\nonly with respect to the second part of the test, i.e.,\nwhether application of the Federal Rule violates §2072(b),\npost, at 7–13. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason\ndifferent from ours. Post, at 17–22.\n  The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not\nthat Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it dis­\nplaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not “function\nas a part of the State’s definition of substantive rights and\nremedies.” Post, at 1. A state procedural rule is not pre­\nempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is “so bound up with,” or “sufficiently intertwined\nwith,” a substantive state-law right or remedy “that it\ndefines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,”\npost, at 4, 13.\n  This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which\nestablished the rule we apply. The concurrence contends\nthat Sibbach did not rule out its approach, but that is not\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on\nthe idiosyncrasies of state law, Sibbach adopted and ap­\nplied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal\nRule “really regulates procedure.” 312 U. S., at 14.9 That\n——————\n  9 The concurrence claims that in Sibbach “[t]he Court . . . had no oc­\n\ncasion to consider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.” Post, at 12. Had\nSibbach been applying the concurrence’s theory, that is quite true—\nwhich demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with Sibbach. For\nconformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the very issue Sibbach\ndecided: The petitioner’s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded\nthe Enabling Act’s authorization, 312 U. S., at 9, 13; the Court faced\nand rejected that argument, id., at 13–16, and proceeded to reverse\nthe lower court for failing to apply Rule 37 correctly, id., at 16. There\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe concurrence’s approach would have yielded the same\nresult in Sibbach proves nothing; what matters is the rule\nwe did apply, and that rule leaves no room for special\nexemptions based on the function or purpose of a particu­\nlar state rule.10 We have rejected an attempt to read into\nSibbach an exception with no basis in the opinion, see\nSchlagenhauf, 379 U. S., at 113–114, and we see no reason\nto find such an implied limitation today.\n  In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply Sibbach,\nbut to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its\napproach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the\nstatutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from\n“abridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive\nright,” §2072(b). See post, at 9–10. There is something to\nthat. It is possible to understand how it can be deter­\nmined whether a Federal Rule “enlarges” substantive\n——————\ncould not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now\nadvocates.\n  The concurrence responds that the “the specific question of ‘the\nobligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state’ ” was\nnot before the Court, post, at 12 (quoting Sibbach, supra, at 9). It is\nclear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie\nprohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion\nunquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules’ compliance with §2072(b),\nand it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,\nwhich does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule\nabridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13–14. To the\nextent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules’ validity vis-à-vis\ncontrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U. S., at 472, and it made\nclear that Sibbach’s test still controls, see 380 U. S., at 464–465,\n470–471.\n  10 The concurrence insists that we have misread Sibbach, since surely\n\na Federal Rule that “in most cases” regulates procedure does not do so\nwhen it displaces one of those “rare” state substantive laws that are\ndisguised as rules of procedure. Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what\nthe Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex­\nplained, supra, at 12–13, most Rules have some effect on litigants’\nsubstantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not\nmean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But it is\nhard to understand how it can be determined whether a\nFederal Rule “abridges” or “modifies” substantive rights\nwithout knowing what state-created rights would obtain if\nthe Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach’s exclusive focus\non the challenged Federal Rule—driven by the very real\nconcern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State\nwould be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13–14—is hard to square\nwith §2072(b)’s terms.11\n  Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven\ndecades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a “special\n——————\n   11 The concurrence’s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the\n\nstatute’s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only\nof “substantive rights,” but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption\nof “procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a\nsubstantive right or remedy,” post, at 19. This would allow States to\nforce a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as\nthey are “sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.” Post,\nat 13.\n   12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,\n\napparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13–14, n. 14. We\nare unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if\nthe case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,\nthe concurrence’s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag­\ngerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as\nestablishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464–465, 470–471.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445–446\n(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the\nFederal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business\nGuides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.\n533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna—\nwhich as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.\nSee Burlington Northern, supra, at 5–6, 8; Business Guides, supra, at\n552–554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the\nU. S. Reports, its rule—and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule\nas the proper unit of analysis—is alive and well.\n   In contrast, Hanna’s obscure obiter dictum that a court “need not\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

And a party\nseeking to overturn a statutory precedent bears an even\ngreater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us,\nibid., and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see,\ne.g., Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 556 (1989); 28\nU. S. C. §1367; Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services,\nInc., 545 U. S. 546, 558 (2005). We do Congress no service\nby presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate\nhas not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car­\nried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.\nAlvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast\naside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since\n(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the\nresult.13\n—————— \n\nwholly blind itself” to a Federal Rule’s effect on a case’s outcome, 380 \n\nU. S., at 473—which the concurrence invokes twice, post, at 8, 13–14,\nn. 14—has never resurfaced in our opinions in the 45 years since its\nfirst unfortunate utterance. Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach’s\nstraightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for\nthat statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency\nbetween the two.\n   13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi­\n\ntion any rule that “really regulates procedure,” Sibbach, supra, at 14,\nwill pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however “bound up” the latter is\nwith substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that\nresult proves our interpretation of §2072(b) implausible, post, at 10,\nn. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term “substantive\nrights” in §2072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but\nalso any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the\ntext nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The\nexamples the concurrence offers—statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards—do not\nmake its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They\nmerely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine\nwhether a rule “really regulates” procedure or substance. If one con­\ncludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal\nRule itself is invalid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But as the concurrence ac­\nknowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:\nThe statute itself refers to “substantive right[s],” §2072(b),\nso there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc­\ntion. What is more, the concurrence’s approach does\nnothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it\nmany times over. Instead of a single hard question of\nwhether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure,\nthat approach will present hundreds of hard questions,\nforcing federal courts to assess the substantive or proce­\ndural character of countless state rules that may conflict\nwith a single Federal Rule.14 And it still does not sidestep\nthe problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one\nmust come face to face with the decision whether or not\nthe state policy (with which a putatively procedural state\nrule may be “bound up”) pertains to a “substantive right or\nremedy,” post, at 19—that is, whether it is substance or\nprocedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to\n——————\n  The concurrence’s concern would make more sense if many Federal\nRules that effectively alter state-law rights “bound up with procedures”\nwould survive under Sibbach. But as the concurrence concedes, post, at\n11, n. 10, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier\ninstances does not prove Sibbach’s interpretation is absurd. Congress\nmay well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure.\n  14 The concurrence argues that its approach is no more “taxing” than\n\nours because few if any Federal Rules that are “facially valid” under the\nEnabling Act will fail the concurrence’s test.

That is unaccept­\nable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules\ncreated to fill supposed “gaps” in positive federal law. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471–472. For where neither the Con­\nstitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of deci­\nsion or authorizes a federal court to supply one, “state law\nmust govern because there can be no other law.” Ibid.; see\nClark, Erie’s Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289,\n1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the\nattendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable\n(indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the\npossibility that the same case may follow a different course\nif filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472–473. The short of the matter is that a Federal\nRule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters\nthe outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shop­\nping. To hold otherwise would be to “disembowel either the\nConstitution’s grant of power over federal procedure” or\nCongress’s exercise of it.

Accordingly, I\nagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23 must apply in this case and join Parts I and\nII–A of the Court’s opinion.

C. §1652, and make the “relatively unguided Erie\nchoice,”2 Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether\nthe state law is the “rule of decision.” But when a situa\ntion is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act\ninquiry by its own terms does not apply. See §1652;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act\n(Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U. S. C. §2072.\n   That does not mean, however, that the federal rule\nalways governs. Congress has provided for a system of\nuniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts\nsitting in diversity operate as “an independent system for\nadministering justice to litigants who properly invoke its\njurisdiction,” Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,\nInc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court\nclones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are\nmanaged by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n473–474. But while Congress may have the constitutional\npower to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with\nstate substantive law in any number of respects, that is\nnot what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in\nthe Enabling Act that although “[t]he Supreme Court”\nmay “prescribe general rules of practice and procedure,”\n§2072(a), those rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right,” §2072(b). Therefore, “[w]hen a\nsituation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the\ncourt has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule”\nunless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.\nHanna, 380 U.

Ibid.; see also id., at 469–470. The\nEnabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in\nthe “relatively unguided Erie choice,” id., at 471, but\ninstead instructs only that federal rules cannot “abridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,” §2072(b). The\nEnabling Act’s limitation does not mean that federal rules\ncannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that\nfederal rules cannot displace a State’s definition of its own\nrights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.\n1, 13–14 (1941) (reasoning that “the phrase ‘substantive\nrights’ ” embraces only those state rights that are sought\nto be enforced in the judicial proceedings).\n   Congress has thus struck a balance: “[H]ousekeeping\nrules for federal courts” will generally apply in diversity\ncases, notwithstanding that some federal rules “will inevi\ntably differ” from state rules. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473.\nBut not every federal “rul[e] of practice or procedure,”\n§2072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal\nrules must be interpreted with some degree of “sensitivity\nto important state interests and regulatory policies,”\nGasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415,\n427, n. 7 (1996), and applied to diversity cases against the\nbackground of Congress’ command that such rules not\nalter substantive rights and with consideration of “the\ndegree to which the Rule makes the character and result\nof the federal litigation stray from the course it would\nfollow in state courts,” Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473. This can\nbe a tricky balance to implement.3\n    It is important to observe that the balance Congress\n\n——————\n  3 SeeChemerinsky §5.3, at 321 (observing that courts “have struggled\nto develop an approach that permits uniform procedural rules to be\napplied in federal court while still allowing state substantive law to\ngovern”).\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                  Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nhas struck turns, in part, on the nature of the state law\nthat is being displaced by a federal rule. And in my view,\nthe application of that balance does not necessarily turn\non whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is\ntraditionally described as substantive or procedural.\nRather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part\nof a State’s framework of substantive rights or remedies.\nSee §2072(b); cf. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471 (“The line be\ntween ‘substance’ and ‘procedure’ shifts as the legal con\ntext changes”); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99,\n108 (1945) (noting that the words “ ‘substance’ ” and “ ‘pro\ncedure’ ” “[e]ach impl[y] different variables depending\nupon the particular problem for which [they] are used”).\n  Applying this balance, therefore, requires careful inter\npretation of the state and federal provisions at issue. “The\nline between procedural and substantive law is hazy,”\nErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 92 (1938) (Reed, J.,\nconcurring), and matters of procedure and matters of\nsubstance are not “mutually exclusive categories with\neasily ascertainable contents,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 17\n(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Rather, “[r]ules which law\nyers call procedural do not always exhaust their effect by\nregulating procedure,” Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\nCorp., 337 U. S. 541, 555 (1949), and in some situations,\n“procedure and substance are so interwoven that rational\nseparation becomes well-nigh impossible,” id., at 559\n(Rutledge, J., dissenting).      A “state procedural rule,\nthough undeniably ‘procedural’ in the ordinary sense of\nthe term,” may exist “to influence substantive outcomes,”\nS. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Dist.,\n60 F. 3d 305, 310 (CA7 1995) (Posner, J.), and may in\nsome instances become so bound up with the state-created\nright or remedy that it defines the scope of that substan\ntive right or remedy. Such laws, for example, may be\nseemingly procedural rules that make it significantly more\ndifficult to bring or to prove a claim, thus serving to limit\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 555\n(state “procedure” that required plaintiffs to post bond\nbefore suing); Guaranty Trust Co., 326 U. S. 99 (state\nstatute of limitations).4 Such “procedural rules” may also\ndefine the amount of recovery. See, e.g., Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427 (state procedure for examining jury verdicts\nas means of capping the available remedy); Moore\n§124.07[3][a] (listing examples of federal courts’ applying\nstate laws that affect the amount of a judgment).\n   In our federalist system, Congress has not mandated\nthat federal courts dictate to state legislatures the form\nthat their substantive law must take. And were federal\ncourts to ignore those portions of substantive state law\nthat operate as procedural devices, it could in many in\nstances limit the ways that sovereign States may define\ntheir rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a\ntraditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the\nscope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts\nmust recognize and respect that choice. Cf. Ragan v.\nMerchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530, 533\n(1949) (“Since th[e] cause of action is created by local law,\nthe measure of it is to be found only in local law. . . .\nWhere local law qualifies or abridges it, the federal court\nmust follow suit”).\n                           II\n  When both a federal rule and a state law appear to\ngovern a question before a federal court sitting in diver\n——————\n   4 Cf.

At both steps\nof the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the\nstate law and the federal rule mean.\n   The court must first determine whether the scope of the\nfederal rule is “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” to “ ‘control the issue’ ”\nbefore the court, “thereby leaving no room for the opera\ntion” of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington\nNorthern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987); Walker\nv. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750, and n. 9\n(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate\nalongside the state rule, then there is no “Ac[t] of Con\ngress” governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.\n§1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules\nof Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In\nsome instances, the “plain meaning” of a federal rule will\nnot come into “ ‘direct collision’ ” with the state law, and\nboth can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In\nother instances, the rule “when fairly construed,” Burling\nton Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 4, with “sensitivity to\nimportant state interests and regulatory policies,”\nGasperini, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7, will not collide with the\nstate law.5\n——————\n    5I thus agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 3–7, that a federal\nrule, like any federal law, must be interpreted in light of many different\nconsiderations, including “sensitivity to important state interests,” post,\nat 7, and “regulatory policies,” post, at 2.

I\ndisagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG, however, about the degree to which\nthe meaning of federal rules may be contorted, absent congressional\nauthorization to do so, to accommodate state policy goals.\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n  If, on the other hand, the federal rule is “sufficiently\nbroad to control the issue before the Court,” such that\nthere is a “direct collision,” Walker, 446 U. S., at 749–750,\nthe court must decide whether application of the federal\nrule “represents a valid exercise” of the “rulemaking au\nthority . . . bestowed on this Court by the Rules Enabling\nAct.” Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 5; see also\nGasperini, 518 U. S., at 427, n. 7; Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471–474. That Act requires, inter alia, that federal rules\n“not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.” 28\nU. S. C. §2072(b) (emphasis added).         Unlike JUSTICE\nSCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that\neffectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created\nright or remedy violates this command. Congress may\nhave the constitutional power “to supplant state law” with\nrules that are “rationally capable of classification as pro\ncedure,” ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbut we should generally presume that it has not done so.\nCf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(observing that “we start with the assumption” that a\nfederal statute does not displace a State’s law “unless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that\nfederal rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right” evinces the opposite intent, as does\nCongress’ decision to delegate the creation of rules to this\nCourt rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§4509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).\n  Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back\ninto the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,\nenlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must\nconsider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to\navoid that impermissible result. See, e.g., Semtek Int’l Inc.\nv. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503 (2001)\n(avoiding an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Proce\n8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

This is not an objection to my\ninterpretation of the Enabling Act—that courts must look to whether a\nfederal rule alters substantive rights in a given case—but simply to the\nway I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that\nregulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might\nactually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA’s objection, more\nover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears\nprocedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on\nappeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially\ncreated rules displacing state substantive law.9\n——————\none might describe as “procedural,” but they nonetheless define sub\nstantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the\nfederal rule would have altered the State’s “substantive rights.”\n   9 The plurality’s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean\n\nthat no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State’s own\nrights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate\n“the manner and the means by which the litigants’ rights are enforced,”\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are\nmany ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State’s\nformulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,\nalthough in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a\ntemporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to\npromulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in\nsome instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi\nlarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could\neviscerate a critical aspect—albeit one that deals with how a right is\nenforced—of a State’s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal\nrule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages\nare reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state\ndamages cap. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA responds that some of these federal rules might be\ninvalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not “really\nregulat[e] procedure.” Ante, at 20, n. 13 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality’s\ntest really is. See n. 10, infra. The response is also limited to those\nrules that can be described as “regulat[ing]” substance, ante, at 13; it\ndoes not address those federal rules that alter the right at issue in the\nlitigation, see Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), only\nwhen they displace particular state laws. JUSTICE SCALIA speculates\nthat “Congress may well have accepted” the occasional alteration of\nsubstantive rights “as the price of a uniform system of federal proce\ndure.” Ante, at 20–21, n. 13. Were we forced to speculate about the\nbalance that Congress struck, I might very well agree. But no specula\ntion is necessary because Congress explicitly told us that federal rules\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed\neral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state\nlaw, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina\ntions about whether application of a given rule would\ndisplace a state determination about substantive rights.\nSee ante, at 15, 21–22, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an\nEnabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is\nmore taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA’s.10 But in any event,\nthat inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it\nmay not be easy to decide what is actually a “substantive\nright,” “the designations substantive and procedural be\ncome important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.”\nEly 723; see also Wright §4509, at 266. The question,\ntherefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on\nfederal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab\nlished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer\neasily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does\nnot give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of\nthe Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and\n\n——————\n“shall not” alter “any” substantive right. §2072(b).\n   10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28\n\nU. S. C. §2072 will displace a State’s definition of its own substantive\nrights. See Wright §4509, at 272 (observing that “unusual cases\noccasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state\nrule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state\nsubstantive rights”). JUSTICE SCALIA’s interpretation, moreover, is not\nmuch more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts’ having\nto evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal\nrule is really “procedural.” It is hard to know the answer to that\nquestion and especially hard to resolve it without considering the\nnature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.\nThe plurality’s “ ‘test’ is no test at all—in a sense, it is little more than\nthe statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce\ndural.” Id., §4509, at 264.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality\nmisreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in\nHanna, “shorthand formulations which have appeared in\nearlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that\nfrequently arise from oversimplification.” 380 U. S., at\n475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is\nfirst necessary to understand the issue that was before the\nCourt. The petitioner raised only the facial question\nwhether “Rules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this\ncourt” and not the specific question of “the obligation of\nfederal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.”11\n312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to\nconsider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12\n——————\n  11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not\n\nvalidly address subjects involving “important questions of policy,” Supp.\nBrief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of\nRespondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner\nargued only that “[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical\nexamination” is “a ‘substantive’ right forbidden by Congress” to be\naddressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “even though in\ntheory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation”). In\nthe petitioner’s own words, “[t]his contention. . . [did] not in itself\ninvolve the [applicable] law of Illinois,” ibid., and the petitioner in her\nbriefing referenced the otherwise applicable state law only “to show\nthat [she] was in a position to make the contention,” ibid., that is, to\nshow that the federal court was applying a federal rule and not, under\nthe Rules of Decision Act, applying state law, see id., at 3.\n  12 The plurality defends its view by including a long quote from two\n\nparagraphs of Sibbach. Ante, at 15–16. But the quoted passage of\nSibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may\n“deal with” particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality’s\nblock quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to\nthe resolution of the case because the matter at issue,\nrequiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to\n“substantive rights” under the Enabling Act. Although\nmost state rules bearing on the litigation process are\nadopted for some policy reason, few seemingly “proce\ndural” rules define the scope of a substantive right or\nremedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet\ning federal and state judgments about privacy interests.\nThose privacy concerns may have been weighty and in\nsome sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the\nscope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga\ntion. Thus, in response to the petitioner’s argument in\nSibbach that “substantive rights” include not only “rights\nsought to be adjudicated by the litigants” but also “general\nprinciple[s]” or “question[s] of public policy that the legis\nlature is able to pass upon,” id., at 2–3, we held that “the\nphrase ‘substantive rights’ ” embraces only state rights,\nsuch as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be\nenforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13–14. If the\nFederal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was\nsufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then\nperhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ\nent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14\n——————\nwhich the Court explained that the term “substantive rights” in the\nEnabling Act “certainly embraces such rights” as “rights conferred by\nlaw to be protected and enforced,” such as “the right not to be injured in\none’s person by another’s negligence” and “to redress [such] infraction.”\nIbid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right “to\nredress [an] infraction,” will depend on the state law that it displaces.\n   13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases “really regu\n\nlates procedure,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not “really regulat[e]\nprocedure” when it displaces those rare state rules that, although\n“procedural” in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the\nrights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is\nprocedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).\n  14 Although this Court’s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n                             III\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as\nwhether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an\nanswer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to\njoin plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that\n“defines the dimensions” of a state-created claim dictates\nthe opposite answer. Post, at 12. As explained above, I\nreadily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state\nrule that is “ ‘procedural’ in the ordinary sense of the\nterm,” S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently\ninterwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem\nedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the\nfederal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,\n\n——————\nlittle significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural\nfederal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state\nright; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the\nCourt. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach’s statement that the Ena\nbling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated\nby the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13–14, for the proposition that “a court, in\nmeasuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the\nEnabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the\nRule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from\nthe course it would follow in state courts,” 380 U. S., at 473. And most\nof our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame\nwork for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned\nSibbach at all but cited only Hanna. See, e.g., Burlington Northern R.\nCo. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 5 (1987).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA notes that in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.\nMurphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946), we used language that supported his\nview. See ante, at 13. But in that case, we contemplated only that the\nFederal Rule in question might have “incidental effects . . . upon the\nrights of litigants,” explaining that “[t]he fact that the application of\nRule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner’s rights to adjudication by\nthe district court for northern Mississippi” rather than southern Mis\nsissippi “will undoubtedly affect those rights.” 326 U. S., at 445–446.\nThere was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the\nrights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify the rights themselves.\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      15\n\n                          Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthis is not such a case.\nRule 23 Controls Class Certification\n  When the District Court in the case before us was asked\nto certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nsquarely governed the determination whether the court\nshould do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule\n23, therefore, must apply unless its application would\nabridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.\n  Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under\nstand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the\nquestion of class certification in this matter because New\nYork has made a substantive judgment that such a class\nshould not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.\nAlthough, as discussed infra, at 17–20, I do not accept the\ndissent’s view of §901(b), I also do not see how the dis\nsent’s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I\n——————\n   15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent’s premises that a class\n\ncannot be certified. The dissent contends that §901(b) is a damages\n“limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or “proscription,” post, at 12,\nn. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 “does not command that a particular remedy\nbe available when a party sues in a representative capacity,” post, at\n11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the\ndissent’s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question\nwhether petitioner may certify a class, and §901(b) would be relevant\nonly to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action\nlawsuit, may collect statutory damages.\n   It may be that if the dissent’s interpretation of §901(b) were correct,\nthis class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the\nfederal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6). But that\nissue was not raised in respondent’s motion to dismiss (from which the\ncase comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the\nCourt. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has “acknowledged\nthat its individual claim” is for less than the required amount in\ncontroversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what\nactual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court\nwere to adopt all of the dissent’s premises, I believe the correct disposi\ntion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of\nwhether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.\n16     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                  Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that courts should “avoi[d]\nimmoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that\nwould trench on state prerogatives,” post, at 3–4, and\nshould in some instances “interpre[t] the federal rules to\navoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,”\npost, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that is\nnot what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule\nshould be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not\nfollow that courts may rewrite the rule.\n   At bottom, the dissent’s interpretation of Rule 23 seems\nto be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its\napplication would create no Erie problem. The dissent\nwould apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie\neven to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,\nand thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But\n“[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,\nthe question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,\nrelatively unguided Erie choice.” Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is\nsatisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro\ntect “state regulatory policies,” post, at 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach would,\nin my view, work an end run around Congress’ system of\nuniform federal rules, see 28 U. S. C. §2072, and our deci\nsion in Hanna. Federal courts can and should interpret\nfederal rules with sensitivity to “state prerogatives,” post,\nat 4; but even when “state interests . . . warrant our re\nspectful consideration,” post, at 8, federal courts cannot\nrewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly\nthat §901(b) is substantive and that class certification\nshould be denied, then they should argue within the Ena\nbling Act’s framework. Otherwise, “the Federal Rule\napplies regardless of contrary state law.” Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, n. 7; accord, Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nApplying Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act\n   As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a\nclass action such as this one, a federal court must inquire\nwhether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify New\nYork’s rights or remedies, and thereby violate the Ena\nbling Act. This inquiry is not always a simple one because\n“[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that\ncannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,”\nWright §4508, at 232–233, and almost “any rule can be\nsaid to have . . . ‘substantive effects,’ affecting society’s\ndistribution of risks and rewards,” Ely 724, n. 170. Faced\nwith a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition\nally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,\none can often argue that the state rule was really some\npart of the State’s definition of its rights or remedies.\n   In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling\nAct problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law\nis designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a\njudgment about how state courts ought to operate and not\na judgment about the scope of state-created rights and\nremedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal\ncourt system, there are costs involved in attempting to\ndiscover the true nature of a state procedural rule and\nallowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule\nthat appears to govern the same question. The mere\npossibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created\nright is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.\n   The text of CPLR §901(b) expressly and unambiguously\napplies not only to claims based on New York law but also\nto claims based on federal law or the law of any other\nState. And there is no interpretation from New York\ncourts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how\n§901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce\ndural in form, serves the function of defining New York’s\nrights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because\nlawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal\nclass actions well before New York passed §901(b) in 1975,\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is\ntrue, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited\namount of legislative history that can be read to suggest\nthat the New York officials who supported §901(b) wished\nto create a “limitation” on New York’s “statutory dam\nages.” Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is\nnot the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7–8\n(opinion of the Court).\n   The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de\nscribe a judgment that §901(b) would operate as a limita\ntion on New York’s statutory damages. In evaluating that\n——————\n   16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns\n\ncreate laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws\nwill apply only within their territory. See post, at 18–20. That is a true\nfact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent’s position. For\none thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if\nthere is no conflict between Rule 23 and §901(b), and the court can thus\napply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the\nonly question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471.      And that inquiry is different from the Rules of\nDecision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469–471.\n   The dissent’s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter\npreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that\nlaws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending\nupon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume\nthat “the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined\nwholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,” American\nBanana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the\ncontext of §901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes\nlittle sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing\nwhat people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed\nto the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.\nThus, §901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it\nstates that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New\nYork Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear\nclaims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims\nunder New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had\nwritten a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up\n§901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong\npresumption is to the contrary.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlegislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between\nprocedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem\ningly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the\nscope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost\nevery rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect\non the outcome of litigation, not every state rule “defines\nthe dimensions of [a] claim itself,” post, at 12. New York\nclearly crafted §901(b) with the intent that only certain\nlawsuits—those for which there were not statutory penal\nties—could be joined in class actions in New York courts.\nThat decision reflects a policy judgment about which\nlawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class\nform and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care\nfully outlines, see post, at 8–10, §901(b) was “apparently”\nadopted in response to fears that the class-action proce\ndure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to “ annihi\nlating punishment of the defendant.” V. Alexander, Prac\ntice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney’s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.\nCrompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,\n1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par\nticularly strong evidence that §901(b) serves to define who\ncan obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a\nclass would enlarge New York’s remedy. Any device that\nmakes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to\nrecover damages.\n   In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some\nopponents of a broad class-action device “argued that there\nwas no need to permit class actions in order to encourage\nlitigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an\naggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to\npursue a claim.” Id., at 211, 863 N. E. 2d, at 1015 (em\nphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely\nthat, for any number of reasons, New York courts should\nnot conduct trials in the class format when that format is\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunnecessary to motivate litigation.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG\nasserts that this could not be true because “suits seeking\nstatutory damages are arguably best suited to the class\ndevice because individual proof of actual damages is un\nnecessary.” Post, at 9–10. But some people believe that\nclass actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as\nthey join together slightly disparate claims or force courts\nto adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss\nthe possibility that New York legislators shared in those\nbeliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when\nit appeared to be unnecessary.\n   The legislative history of §901 thus reveals a classically\nprocedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims\nin New York courts (under any source of law) only when it\nis necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the\nclass tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula\ntion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for\nbriefs. There is of course a difference of degree between\nthose examples and class certification, but not a difference\nof kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical\neffect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but\nthat does not transform it into a damages “proscription,”\npost, at 12, n. 6, 21, or “limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,\n25.18\n——————\n   17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature\n\nwould create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply\nonly when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a\nlawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to\nsee how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York’s\npenalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or\nindividual, and that §901(b) addresses penalties that are created under\nany source of state or federal law.\n   18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter\n\nwould “transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.” Post, at 1.

If the applicable federal rule did not\ngovern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly\nread not to do so), then those considerations would matter,\nfor precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See post, at\n17–24. But that is not this case. As the Court explained\nin Hanna, it is an “incorrect assumption that the rule of\nErie R. Co. v. Thompkins constitutes the appropriate test\nof . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure.” 380 U. S., at 469–470. “It is true that both the\nEnabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal\ncourts are to apply state ‘substantive’ law and federal\n‘procedural’ law,” but the tests are different and reflect the\nfact that “they were designed to control very different\nsorts of decisions.” Id., at 471.\n  Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only\ndecision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case\nwould “abridge, enlarge or modify” New York’s substantive\nrights or remedies. §2072(b). Although one can argue\nthat class certification would enlarge New York’s “limited”\ndamages remedy, see post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, such\narguments rest on extensive speculation about what the\nNew York Legislature had in mind when it created\n§901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing\nnarratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect\nthe plain textual reading of §901(b), a rule in New York’s\nprocedural code about when to certify class actions\nbrought under any source of law, and respect Congress’\ndecision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal\ncourts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be\nmore than just a possibility that the state rule is different\n—————— \n\nprocedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located\n\ncourthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other fea\n\ntures of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue. \n\n22     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state\ncourt, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York\nIns. Law Ann. §5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over\ndue benefits would, by Shady Grove’s own measure,\namount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal\ncourt based on the parties’ diverse citizenship and request\ning class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for\nthe class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.\nThe New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in\nstructing that, unless specifically permitted, “an action to\nrecover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre\nated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a\nclass action.” N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) §901(b)\n(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures\nfor the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts\nthe application of §901(b) in diversity suits.\n  The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New\nYork’s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.\n2        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Center for Humani\nties, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427 (1996); see Erie R. Co. v.\nTompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Justice Harlan aptly\nconveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described Erie\nas “one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism,\nexpressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of\njudicial power between the state and federal systems.”\nHanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 474 (1965) (concurring\nopinion). Although we have found Erie’s application\n“sometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor,” Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.\n   The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal\ncourts from generating substantive law in diversity ac\ntions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as\npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a\npolicy of prime importance to our federal system. We have\n——————\n  1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, “[t]he laws of the several\n\nstates, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or\nActs of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in\ncases where they apply.” 28 U.

York, 326\nU. S. 99, 110 (1945).\n  The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,\nauthorizes us to “prescribe general rules of practice and\nprocedure” for the federal courts, but with a crucial re\nstriction: “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.” 28 U. S. C. §2072. Pursuant to\nthis statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ\ning, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the\nlimits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard\nCorp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act\ncounsels against “adventurous application” of Rule 23; any\ntension with the Act “is best kept within tolerable limits.”);\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 612–613\n(1997). See also Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin\nCorp., 531 U. S. 497, 503–504 (2001).\n  If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts\nwith state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with\nthe Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 469–474. If, however, no Federal\nRule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision\nAct, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs\nfederal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when\nfailure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield\nmarkedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing\nthat the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act\nsimultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we\nhave endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within\nthe bounds of both congressional directives.\n                              B\n   In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men\ntioned in the Court’s opinion, we have avoided immoderate\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Armco Steel\nCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1980) (quoting Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472). To displace state law, a Federal Rule,\n“when fairly construed,” must be “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” so\nas “to ‘control the issue’ before the court, thereby leaving\nno room for the operation of that law.” Burlington North\nern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987) (quoting\nWalker, 446 U. S., at 749–750, and n. 9; emphasis added);\ncf. Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22,\n37–38 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[I]n deciding\nwhether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a\nparticular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi\ncant disuniformity between state and federal courts\nshould be avoided if the text permits.”).\n   In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the\nFederal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer\nv. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the\nCourt read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de\nfenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed\ndefenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in\nsuch cases, Palmer held, state law controls.\n   Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &\nWarehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that\nstate law determines when a diversity suit commences for\npurposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although\nFederal Rule 3 specified that “[a] civil action is commenced\nby filing a complaint with the court,” we held that the\nRule did not displace a state law that tied an action’s\ncommencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531–\n533. The “cause of action [wa]s created by local law,” the\nCourt explained, therefore “the measure of it [wa]s to be\nfound only in local law.” Id., at 533.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Similarly in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,\n337 U. S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver\nsity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq\nuisite to pursuit of a stockholder’s derivative action, to\npost a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga\ntion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff’s insti\ntution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the\nFederal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder’s\nmaintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no\nconflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques\ntion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court\nobserved. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for\ncosts requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors\ncould not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the\nfederal court’s diversity jurisdiction.\n   In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, “the\nscope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing\nparty urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule\nwhich covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the\nenforcement of state law.” 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna\nitself, the Court found the clash “unavoidable,” ibid.; the\npetitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by\nFederal Rule 4(d)(1), but that “how-to” method did not\nsatisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service\non an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the\nMassachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce\ndure, however, “[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .\nthat federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts\napplying them, and that the process of interpretation can\nand should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter\nests.” R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,\nHart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal\nSystem 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).\n   Following Hanna, we continued to “interpre[t] the fed\neral rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory\npolicies.” Hart & Wechsler 593. In Walker, the Court took\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                 GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nup the question whether Ragan should be overruled; we\nheld, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly\nconflict with state rules governing the time when an ac\ntion commences for purposes of tolling a limitations pe\nriod. 446 U. S., at 749–752. Rule 3, we said, addresses\nonly “the date from which various timing requirements of\nthe Federal Rules begin to run,” id., at 751, and does not\n“purpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,” id., at 750–751.\nSignificant state policy interests would be frustrated, we\nobserved, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state\nrule, which required actual service on the defendant to\nstop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750–\n752.\n   We were similarly attentive to a State’s regulatory\npolicy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the\nstandard for determining when the large size of a jury\nverdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts\nalike had generally employed a “shock the conscience” test\nin reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,\nat 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule\n59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed\nthat a trial court could grant a new trial “for any of the\nreasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted\nin actions at law in the courts of the United States.” Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide\ngreater control, New York prescribed procedures under\nwhich jury verdicts would be examined to determine\nwhether they “deviate[d] materially from what would be\nreasonable compensation.” See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n423–425 (quoting CPLR §5501(c)). This Court held that\nRule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of\nNew York’s invigorated test.\n   Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim\npreclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a\ndiversity action on the basis of a California statute of\nlimitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

(Plaintiff chose Maryland because\nthat State’s limitations period had not yet run.) We held\nthat Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun\ntary dismissal “operate[d] as an adjudication on the mer\nits,” did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in\nMaryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary\nland courts from entertaining the case, we said, “would\narguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules\nEnabling Act,” 531 U. S., at 503, and “would in many cases\nviolate [Erie’s] federalism principle,” id., at 504.\n   In sum, both before and after Hanna, the above\ndescribed decisions show, federal courts have been cau\ntioned by this Court to “interpre[t] the Federal Rules . . .\nwith sensitivity to important state interests,” Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 427, n. 7, and a will “to avoid conflict with\nimportant state regulatory policies,” id., at 438, n. 22\n(internal quotation marks omitted).2 The Court veers\n——————\n  2JUSTICE  STEVENS stakes out common ground on this point: “[F]ederal\nrules,” he observes, “must be interpreted with some degree of ‘sensitiv\nity to important state interests and regulatory policies,’ . . . and applied\nto diversity cases against the background of Congress’ command that\nsuch rules not alter substantive rights and with consideration of ‘the\ndegree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal\nlitigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts,’ Hanna\n[v. Plumer], 380 U. S. [460, 473 (1965)].” Ante, at 3. (opinion concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment). See also ante, at 4 (“A ‘state\nprocedural rule, though undeniably procedural in the ordinary sense of\nthe term’ may exist ‘to influence substantive outcomes,’ . . . and may in\nsome instances become so bound up with the state-created right or\nremedy that it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy.”\n(some internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 5 (“When a State\nchooses to use a traditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining\nthe scope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts must recog\nnize and respect that choice.”). Nevertheless, JUSTICE STEVENS sees no\nreason to read Rule 23 with restraint in this particular case; the Fed\neral Rule preempts New York’s damages limitation, in his view, be\ncause §901(b) is “a procedural rule that is not part of New York’s\nsubstantive law.” Ante, at 1.

Yet\ntoday, the Court gives no quarter to New York’s limitation\non statutory damages and requires the lower courts to\nthwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive\ndamages, New York’s law controls the penalty to which a\ndefendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story\nbehind §901(b)’s enactment deserves telling.\n   In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New\nYork proposed a new class-action statute designed “to set\nup a flexible, functional scheme” that would provide “an\neffective, but controlled group remedy.” Judicial Confer\nence Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws\npp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the\nlegislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class\nactions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for\ncertification, eventually codified at §901(a), that closely\ntracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR §901(a) (requir\ning, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,\ntypicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).\n   While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New\nYork Legislature’s hopper, “various groups advocated for\nthe addition of a provision that would prohibit class action\nplaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty\n——————\nmirror reality, as I later explain.

New York’s decision\ninstead to block class-action proceedings for statutory\ndamages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means\nto a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant’s\nliability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbi\ntant inflation of penalties—remedies the New York Legis\nlature created with individual suits in mind.3\n                              D\n   Shady Grove contends—and the Court today agrees—\nthat Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York’s prohibi\ntion on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions.\nThe Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes, states that\nShady Grove’s suit “may be” maintained as a class action,\nwhich conflicts with §901(b)’s instruction that it “may not”\nso proceed. Ante, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted\nand emphasis deleted). Accordingly, the Court insists,\n§901(b) “cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.” Ibid.

See, e.g., Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 476\n(1978). When representative plaintiffs seek statutory damages, pres\nsure to settle may be heightened because a class action poses the risk of\nmassive liability unmoored to actual injury.

As the Second Circuit well un\nderstood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to\nclass certification and postcertification proceedings—but it\ndoes not command that a particular remedy be available\nwhen a party sues in a representative capacity.

Sensibly read, Rule 23 governs proce\ndural aspects of class litigation, but allows state law to\ncontrol the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may\npursue.\n——————\n  4 See, e.g., In re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation,\n515 F.

[to] look to state rules\nand decisional law rather than to Rule 23 . . . in making their class\ncertification decisions.” Brief for Petitioner 55. This slippery-slope\nprojection is both familiar and false. Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of\nAmerica 169 (1990) (“Judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of\nanalogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”). In this case,\nCPLR §901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,\nbut Allstate does not contend that §901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for\nRespondent 18 (“There is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica\ntion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground\nsquarely occupied by Rule 23.”). Federal courts sitting in diversity have\nroutinely applied Rule 23’s certification standards, rather than compa\nrable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\nExport Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18–24 (CA1 2008); Order and\nReasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.\nAction No. 05–4182 (ED La., Aug. 6, 2009).\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing\na claim for relief, while §901(b) defines the dimensions of\nthe claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that\n§901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than\nretail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have\nembedded the limitation in every provision creating a\ncause of action for which a penalty is authorized; §901(b)\noperates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a\npart of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be\nwere it included claim by claim in the New York Code.\n  The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit\n“may” or “may not” be maintained as a class action. See\nante, at 4–6. Putting the question that way, the Court\ndoes not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes\nclass treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be\ncause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and\nefficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section\n901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does\nnot allow class members to recover statutory damages\nbecause the New York Legislature considered the result of\nadjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The\nfair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti\nmate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of\nstate law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State’s\nlawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The\nIrrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L.

On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme\ndies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit. Legislative\nhistory confirms this objective, but is not essential to revealing it.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nnotion that one directly impinges on Rule 23’s domain,\nwhile the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the\noffice of Rule 23.8\n——————\n  7 There   is, of course, a difference between “justly administering [a]\nremedy,” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941), and prescrib\ning the content of that remedy; if Rule 23 can be read to increase a\nplaintiff’s recovery from $1,000,000 to some greater amount, the Rule\nhas arguably “enlarge[d] . . . [a] substantive right” in violation of the\nRules Enabling Act. 28 U. S. C. §2072(b). The plurality appears to\nacknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found\nto be in compliance with the Act have not “altered . . . available reme\ndies.” Ante, at 13. But the Court’s relentless reading of Rule 23 today\ndoes exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of\nclass-size statutory damages even though the New York provision\ninstructs that such penalties shall not be available.\n  8 The Court states that “[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect\n\nour perception of legislative purpose.” Ante, at 9. But we can, of\ncourse, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State’s regulatory policy\nto decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See\nsupra, at 3–7.

Plaintiffs seeking\nto vindicate claims for which the State has provided a\nstatutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action\nif they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual\ndamages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative\nclass member who objects can opt out and pursue actual\ndamages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an\nindividual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The Radec Corp.,\n260 F. R. D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); Brzychnalski v. Unesco,\nInc., 35 F.

In this manner, the Second Circuit ex\n——————\nfor purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule\nindisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural\npurposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action\nmay be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages\nprescribed by state law. On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of\n§901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.\n  9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.\n\nIn discussing the remedial bar effected by §901(b), the bill’s sponsor\nexplained that a “statutory class action for actual damages would still\nbe permissible.” S.

On this understand\ning, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class\nwaives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v.

In sum,\nwhile phrased as responsive to the question whether\ncertain class actions may begin, §901(b) is unmistakably\naimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that\nremedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.\n  Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves §901(b) in control of\nthe remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis\npelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which\ncounsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions\nagainst stretching a rule to cover every situation it could\nconceivably reach.10 The Court states that “[t]here is no\nreason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether\nclaims made eligible for class treatment by some other law\nshould be certified as class actions.” Ante, at 5. To the\ncontrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and\nSemtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates\nthe right to recover. See supra, at 4–7. That is plainly so\non a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there\nany reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief\nwhen the State that created the remedy disallows its\npursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our\nfederal system should give.\n  Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain\npenalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class\nrelief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for\ncertain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum\nrecovery.

Had the Court re\nflected on the respect for state regulatory interests en\ndorsed in our decisions, it would have found no cause to\ninterpret Rule 23 so woodenly—and every reason not to do\nso. Cf.

Placement in the CPLR is\nhardly dispositive. The provision held “substantive” for\nErie purposes in Gasperini is also contained in the CPLR\n(§5501(c)), as are limitations periods, §201 et seq., pre\nscriptions plainly “substantive” for Erie purposes however\nthey may be characterized for other purposes, see York,\n326 U.

See also, e.g., 1 Restatement (Sec\nond) of Conflict of Laws §133, Reporter’s Note, p. 369\n(1969) (hereinafter Restatement) (“Under the rule of Erie\n. . . the federal courts have classified the burden of persua\nsion as to contributory negligence as a matter of substan\ntive law that is governed by the rule of the State in which\nthey sit even though the courts of that State have charac\nterized their rule as procedural for choice-of-law pur\nposes.”); Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict\nof Laws, 42 Yale L.

But neither is it expressly\nextended to claims arising under foreign law. The rule\nprescribes, without elaboration either way, that “an action\nto recover a penalty . . . may not be maintained as a class\naction.” We have often recognized that “general words”\nappearing in a statute may, in fact, have limited applica\ntion; “[t]he words ‘any person or persons,’ ” for example,\n“are broad enough to comprehend every human being.\nBut general words must not only be limited to cases within\nthe jurisdiction of the state, but also to those objects to\nwhich the legislature intended to apply them.” United\nStates v.

The article centers on a now-archaic Massa\nchusetts law that prevented married women from binding\nthemselves by contract as sureties for their husbands.\nDiscussing whether the Massachusetts prescription ap\nplied to transactions involving foreign factors (a foreign\nforum, foreign place of contracting, or foreign parties),\nCurrie observed:\n     “When the Massachusetts legislature addresses itself\n     to the problem of married women as sureties, the un\n     developed image in its mind is that of Massachusetts\n     married women, husbands, creditors, transactions,\n     courts, and judgments.

We note first that the TCPA itself\ncalls for the application of state law. See Rudgayzer, 22\nApp. Div. 3d, at 149–150, 799 N. Y.

Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.\nThey supply “substantive” law in diversity suits, see York,\n326 U. S., at 109–112, even though, as Shady Grove ac\nknowledges, state courts often apply the forum’s limita\ntions period as a “procedural” bar to claims arising under\nthe law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 16–17. See also Restatement §§142–143 (when\nadjudicating a foreign cause of action, State may use\neither its own or the foreign jurisdiction’s statute of limi\ntations, whichever is shorter). Similarly, federal courts\nsitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the\nburden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 177 (1943), yet state courts adju\ndicating foreign causes of action often apply their own\nlocal law to this issue. See Restatement §133 and Re\nporter’s Note.\n   In short, Shady Grove’s effort to characterize §901(b) as\nsimply “procedural” cannot successfully elide this funda\nmental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of\nan issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the\nsense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the\nRules of Decision Act commands application of the State’s\nlaw in diversity suits. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9; York, 326 U. S., at 109. As\nthis case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising\ndiversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award\nstatutory penalties in class actions while New York courts\nare bound by §901(b)’s proscription, “substantial varia\ntions between state and federal [money judgments] may be\nexpected.” Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 430 (quoting Hanna,\n22        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                    v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n380 U. S., at 467–468 (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThe “variation” here is indeed “substantial.” Shady Grove\nseeks class relief that is ten thousand times greater than\nthe individual remedy available to it in state court. As the\nplurality acknowledges, ante, at 22, forum shopping will\nundoubtedly result if a plaintiff need only file in federal\ninstead of state court to seek a massive monetary award\nexplicitly barred by state law. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n431 (“Erie precludes a recovery in federal court signifi\ncantly larger than the recovery that would have been\ntolerated in state court.”).13 The “accident of diversity of\ncitizenship,” Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S.\n487, 496 (1941), should not subject a defendant to such\naugmented liability. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at 467 (“The\nErie rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be\nunfair for the character or result of a litigation materially\nto differ because the suit had been brought in a federal\ncourt.”).\n   It is beyond debate that “a statutory cap on damages\nwould supply substantive law for Erie purposes.”\nGasperini, 518 U. S., at 428. See also id., at 439–440\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“A state-law ceiling on allowable\ndamages . . . is a substantive rule of decision that federal\ncourts must apply in diversity cases governed by New\nYork law.”); id., at 464 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“State\nsubstantive law controls what injuries are compensable\nand in what amount.”). In Gasperini, we determined that\nNew York’s standard for measuring the alleged excessive\n——————\n  13 In contrast, many “state rules ostensibly addressed to procedure,”\nante, at 10 (majority opinion)—including pleading standards and rules\ngoverning summary judgment, pretrial discovery, and the admissibility\nof certain evidence—would not so hugely impact forum choices. It is\ndifficult to imagine a scenario that would promote more forum shopping\nthan one in which the difference between filing in state and federal\ncourt is the difference between a potential award of $500 and one of\n$5,000,000.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nness of a jury verdict was designed to provide a control\nanalogous to a damages cap. Id., at 429. The statute was\nframed as “a procedural instruction,” we noted, “but the\nState’s objective [wa]s manifestly substantive.” Ibid.\n    Gasperini’s observations apply with full force in this\ncase. By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a\nclass action, §901(b) controls a defendant’s maximum\nliability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial\nprovision could have been written as an explicit cap: “In\nany class action seeking statutory damages, relief is lim\nited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recov\nered in an individual suit.” That New York’s Legislature\nused other words to express the very same meaning\nshould be inconsequential.\n    We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,\nin a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created\nremedies. See Woods, 337 U. S., at 538 (in a diversity\ncase, a plaintiff “barred from recovery in the state court\n. . . should likewise be barred in the federal court”); York,\n326 U. S., at 108–109 (federal court sitting in diversity\n“cannot afford recovery if the right to recover is made\nunavailable by the State nor can it substantively affect the\nenforcement of the right as given by the State”). Just as\nErie precludes a federal court from entering a deficiency\njudgment when a State has “authoritatively announced\nthat [such] judgments cannot be secured within its bor\nders,” Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S. 183, 191 (1947), so too\nErie should prevent a federal court from awarding statu\ntory penalties aggregated through a class action when\nNew York prohibits this recovery. See also Ragan, 337\nU. S., at 533 (“Where local law qualifies or abridges [a\nclaim], the federal court must follow suit. Otherwise there\nis a different measure of the cause of action in one court\nthan in the other, and the principle of Erie . . . is trans\ngressed.”). In sum, because “New York substantive law\ngoverns [this] claim for relief, New York law . . . guide[s]\n24       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS.

S., at 437.14\n                              III\n  The Court’s erosion of Erie’s federalism grounding im\npels me to point out the large irony in today’s judgment.\nShady Grove is able to pursue its claim in federal court\nonly by virtue of the recent enactment of the Class Action\nFairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C. §1332(d). In\nCAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law\nbased class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,\nat least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in\ncontroversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress\nsought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness\nof some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 109–14, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers\nfrom “gam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide\nor multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges\nhave reputations for readily certifying classes.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving “the ‘I\nnever met a class action I didn’t like’ approach to class\ncertification” that “is prevalent in state courts in some\nlocalities”). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer—\nnot more—class actions overall. Congress surely never\nanticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a mecca\nfor suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched: class\nactions seeking state-created penalties for claims arising\nunder state law—claims that would be barred from class\ntreatment in the State’s own courts. Cf. Woods, 337 U. S.,\nat 537 (“[T]he policy of Erie . . . preclude[s] maintenance in\n——————\n  14 There is no question that federal courts can “give effect to the sub\nstantive thrust of [§901(b)] without untoward alteration of the federal\nscheme for the trial and decision of civil cases.” Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n426. There is no risk that individual plaintiffs seeking statutory\npenalties will flood federal courts with state-law claims that could be\nmanaged more efficiently on a class basis; the diversity statute’s\namount-in-controversy requirement ensures that small state-law\ndisputes remain in state court.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.
