A. v. \n\n          ALLSTATE INSURANCE CO. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08\u20131008. Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided March 31, 2010\nAfter respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New\n  York law on petitioner Shady Grove\u2019s insurance claim, Shady Grove\n  filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it\n  and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal\n  Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of\n  jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), which precludes a\n  class action to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d such as statutory interest. Affirm\n  ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in\n  compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, would\n  control if it conflicted with \u00a7901(b), but held there was no conflict be\n  cause \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues\u2014eligibility of the\n  particular type of claim for class treatment and certifiability of a\n  given class, respectively. Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court\n  of Appeals held that \u00a7901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting\n  in diversity because it is \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R.\n  Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n549 F. 3d 137, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  PARTS I and II\u2013A, concluding that \u00a7901(b) does not preclude a federal\n  district court sitting in diversity from entertaining a class action un\n  der Rule 23. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) If Rule 23 answers the question in dispute, it governs here\n  unless it exceeds its statutory authorization or Congress\u2019s rulemak\n  ing power. Burlington Northern R.

CO.\n                            Syllabus\n\n       (b) Rule 23(b) answers the question in dispute\u2014whether Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit may proceed as a class action\u2014when it states that \u201c[a]\n    class action may be maintained\u201d if certain conditions are met. Since\n    \u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as a class action\u201d because of the\n    relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless\n    Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit\u2019s view that \u00a7901(b) and\n    Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil\n    ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23\n    explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case\n    meeting its criteria. Allstate\u2019s arguments based on the exclusion of\n    some federal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach pursuant to federal statutes\n    and on \u00a7901\u2019s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (c) The dissent\u2019s claim that \u00a7901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be\n    cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is\n    foreclosed by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.\n    The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to\n    avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), does\n    not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent\u2019s approach does not\n    avoid a conflict between \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren\n    der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II\u2013B and II\u2013D:\n       (a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, not Erie, controls\n    the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)\u2019s re\n    quirement that federal procedural rules \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or mod\n    ify any substantive right\u201d means that a Rule must \u201creally regulat[e]\n    procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec\n    ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and\n    redress for disregard or infraction of them,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n    312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party\u2019s\n    rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing\n    those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,\n    or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that\n    criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\n    separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate\u2019s arguments\n    asserting \u00a7901(b)\u2019s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the\n    substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat\n    ters, but that of the Federal Rule. See, e.g., id., at 14. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (b) Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in\n    state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable re\n    sult of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress cre\n    ated.

S., at 13\u201314. Pp. 16\u201322.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n  must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and\n  it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case. Pp. 1\u201322.\n            (a) When the application of a federal rule would \u201cabridge,\n  enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), the\n  federal rule cannot govern. In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates\n  an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied,\n  displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use\n  of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it\n  functions to define the scope of the state-created right. Examples\n  may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to\n  bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of\n  recovery. An application of a federal rule that directly collides with\n  such a state law violates the Rules Enabling Act. Pp. 1\u201313.\n            (b) N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), however, is not such a\n  state law. It is a procedural rule that is not part of New York\u2019s sub\n  stantive law.

A., provided medical care\nto Sonia E. Galvez for injuries she suffered in an automo\u00ad\nbile accident. As partial payment for that care, Galvez\nassigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits\nunder a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance\nCo. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene\u00ad\nfits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to\npay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a)\n(West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time,\nand it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on\nthe overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see ibid.\n   Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York to recover the unpaid statutory in\u00ad\nterest.

The District Court dismissed the suit for\nlack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It rea\u00ad\nsoned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), which pre\u00ad\ncludes a suit to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d from proceeding as a\nclass action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,\ndespite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding\nthat statutory interest is a \u201cpenalty\u201d under New York law,\nit held that \u00a7901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.\nAnd, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim\n(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in\u00ad\ncontroversy requirement for individual suits under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The\ncourt did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com\u00ad\npliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072,\nwould control if it conflicted with \u00a7901(b). But there was\nno conflict because (as we will describe in more detail\nbelow) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and\n\u00a7901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule\non point, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7901(b) is \u201csub\u00ad\nstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U. S. 64 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal\ncourts sitting in diversity.\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n   The framework for our decision is familiar. We must\nfirst determine whether Rule 23 answers the question in\ndispute. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Shady Grove had asserted jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(2),\n\nwhich relaxes, for class actions seeking at least $5 million, the rule\nagainst aggregating separate claims for calculation of the amount in\ncontroversy. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545\nU. S. 546, 571 (2005).\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS.

If it does, it governs\u2014New York\u2019s law not\u00ad\nwithstanding\u2014unless it exceeds statutory authorization or\nCongress\u2019s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.\nPlumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463\u2013464 (1965). We do not wade\ninto Erie\u2019s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli\u00ad\ncable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469\u2013471.\n                              A\n   The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove\u2019s suit\nmay proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an\u00ad\nswer. It states that \u201c[a] class action may be maintained\u201d if\ntwo conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria\nset forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also\nmust fit into one of the three categories described in sub\u00ad\ndivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this\ncreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit\nmeets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class\naction. (The Federal Rules regularly use \u201cmay\u201d to confer\ncategorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n8(d)(2)\u2013(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)\u2013(b), 20(a)(1)\u2013(2), 27(a)(1),\n30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural\nentitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all\nformula for deciding the class-action question. Because\n\u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question\u2014i.e., it\nstates that Shady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as\na class action\u201d (emphasis added) because of the relief it\nseeks\u2014it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.\n   The Second Circuit believed that \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 do\nnot conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,\nit said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether\na given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on\nthe other hand, addresses an antecedent question:\nwhether the particular type of claim is eligible for class\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                 the Court\n\ntreatment in the first place\u2014a question on which Rule 23\nis silent. See 549 F. 3d, at 143\u2013144. Allstate embraces\nthis analysis. Brief for Respondent 12\u201313.\n   We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility\nand certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi\u00ad\ntions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that\neligibility must depend on the \u201cparticular cause of action\u201d\nasserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at\n12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro\u00ad\nvide that only claims involving more than a certain num\u00ad\nber of plaintiffs are \u201celigible\u201d for class treatment in federal\ncourt. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)\u2019s prerequi\u00ad\nsites \u201celigibility criteria\u201d would obviate Allstate\u2019s objec\u00ad\ntion\u2014a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc\u00ad\ntion is made-to-order.\n   There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as\naddressing only whether claims made eligible for class\ntreatment by some other law should be certified as class\nactions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly\nnor implicitly empowers a federal court \u201cto certify a class\nin each and every case\u201d where the Rule\u2019s criteria are met.\nId., at 13\u201314. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It\nsays that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied \u201c[a]\nclass action may be maintained\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014not \u201ca\nclass action may be permitted.\u201d Courts do not maintain\nactions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23\u2019s\n\u201cmay\u201d is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring\nhis claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati\ncally applies \u201cin all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699\u2013700 (1979).\n   Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some\nfederal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(e)(1)(B)\u2014which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule\n23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\nrather leaves room for laws like \u00a7901(b). But Congress,\nunlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an\nindividual rule as it sees fit\u2014either by directly amending\nthe rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in\ncertain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517\nU. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created\nspecific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule\ndoes not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If\nRule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,\nthe statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.\n  Allstate next suggests that the structure of \u00a7901 shows\nthat Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),\nit notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly\nanalogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that\nsubsection is pre-empted). But \u00a7901(b)\u2019s rule barring class\nactions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,\nand where it applies \u00a7901(a) does not. This shows, accord\u00ad\ning to Allstate, that \u00a7901(b) concerns a separate subject.\nPerhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub\u00ad\nject of \u00a7901(a). But the question before us is whether it\nconcerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23\u2014\nand for purposes of answering that question the way New\nYork has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23\npermits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a\nState cannot limit that permission by structuring one part\nof its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part\nthat imposes additional requirements. Both of \u00a7901\u2019s\nsubsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule\n23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.\nCf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7\u20138.\n  The dissent argues that \u00a7901(b) has nothing to do with\nwhether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class\naction, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.\nSee post, at 8\u201317 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.).

Accordingly, the dissent says,\nRule 23 and New York\u2019s law may coexist in peace.\n   We need not decide whether a state law that limits the\nremedies available in an existing class action would con\u00ad\nflict with Rule 23; that is not what \u00a7901(b) does. By its\nterms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from \u201cmain\u00ad\ntain[ing]\u201d a class action seeking statutory penalties.\nUnlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other\nremedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,\n\u00a7901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may\naward; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming\ninto existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by\n\u00a7901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu\u00ad\ntory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in\nadvance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the\nevent the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the\nstatute\u2019s clear prohibition on \u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such suits as\nclass actions.\n   The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid \u00a7901(b)\u2019s\nbarrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a\nrequest for statutory penalties. See post, at 14\u201315. Even\nassuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, post, at 13, we express no view\n\nas to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a\nsingle suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.\nWhether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, \u00a7901(b) does conflict\nbecause it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main\u00ad\ntain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal\nstatutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. \u00a72605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal\nRules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case\nof a conflict.\n   5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737\n8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                the Court\n\nthat a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class\naction would not at all prove that \u00a7901(b) is addressed\nonly to remedies. If the state law instead banned class\nactions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff\ncould drop the fraud counts from his complaint and pro\u00ad\nceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would\nnot mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban\nwould affect only the procedural means by which the\nremedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent\ncorrectly abandons Allstate\u2019s eligibility-certifiability dis\u00ad\ntinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.\n  The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of\n\u00a7901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23\u2014i.e., whether\na class action may be maintained\u2014but insists the provi\u00ad\nsion\u2019s purpose is to restrict only remedies. See post, at 12\u2013\n15; post, at 15 (\u201c[W]hile phrased as responsive to the\nquestion whether certain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b)\nis unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions\nmust end\u201d). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further proce\u00ad\ndural fairness and efficiency, \u00a7901(b) (we are told) \u201cre\u00ad\nsponds to an entirely different concern\u201d: the fear that\nallowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide\nbasis would \u201cproduce overkill.\u201d Post, at 12, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent reaches this con\u00ad\nclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in\nthe law\u2019s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the\nLegislature \u201capparently fear[ed]\u201d that combining class\nactions and statutory penalties \u201ccould result in annihilat\u00ad\ning punishment of the defendant,\u201d V.

Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863\nN. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).\n  This evidence of the New York Legislature\u2019s purpose is\npretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent\u2019s account of\nthe Legislature\u2019s objective at face value, it cannot override\nthe statute\u2019s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the\nremedy a plaintiff can obtain, \u00a7901(b) achieves that end by\nlimiting a plaintiff\u2019s power to maintain a class action. The\nmanner in which the law \u201ccould have been written,\u201d post,\nat 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla\u00ad\nture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our\nperception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380 (1998).6 The\ndissent\u2019s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated\nrather than furthered by revising state laws when a po\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Our  decision in Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),\ndiscussed by the dissent, post, at 5\u20136, 13\u201314, n. 8, is not to the contrary.\nThere we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is\n\u201c \u2018commenced\u2019 \u201d by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a\nstate law providing that \u201c \u2018[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,\nwithin the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each\ndefendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .\u2019 \u201d\n446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, \u00a797 (1971); altera\u00ad\ntion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, \u201cgoverns the\ndate from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules\nbegin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations\u201d or tolling\nrules, which it did not \u201cpurpor[t] to displace.\u201d 446 U. S., at 751, 750.\nThe texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed\nthat the State\u2019s actual-service rule was (in the State\u2019s judgment) an\n\u201cintegral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita\u00ad\ntions,\u201d id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court\nmay resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal\nrules by resorting to the state law\u2019s ostensible objectives.\n10     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS.

Wilson\n& Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941). It would mean, to begin\nwith, that one State\u2019s statute could survive pre-emption\n(and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court)\nwhile another State\u2019s identical law would not, merely\nbecause its authors had different aspirations. It would\nalso mean that district courts would have to discern, in\nevery diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively\npre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely\nconflicts with federal law. That task will often prove\narduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the\naim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to\nthe extent the dissent\u2019s purpose-driven approach depends\non its characterization of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s aims as substantive, it\nwould apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to\nprocedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody\npolicy preferences about the types of claims that should\nsucceed\u2014as do rules governing summary judgment, pre\u00ad\ntrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.\nHard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state\nsupreme court\u2019s pronouncement of the law\u2019s purpose\nwould settle the issue, since existence of the factual predi\u00ad\ncate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a fed\u00ad\neral question. Predictably, federal judges would be con\u00ad\ndemned to poring through state legislative history\u2014which\nmay be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less famil\u00ad\niar than its federal counterpart, see R.

The central difficulty is that even artificial\nnarrowing cannot render \u00a7901(b) compatible with Rule 23.\nWhatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict\neach other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see\npost, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in\na manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat\u00ad\nute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings\u2014one\nthat would violate \u00a72072(b) and another that would not\u2014\nwe would agree.

But it is not.\nRule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any\nfederal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the\nRule\u2019s prerequisites are met.

The search for state interests and policies that are \u201cimportant\u201d\nis just as standardless as the \u201cimportant or substantial\u201d criterion we\nrejected in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.

There is no other way to reach the dissent\u2019s destina\u00ad\ntion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule\n23 falls within the statutory authorization.\n                               B\n   Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts\nto supplant state law with judge-made rules.

York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That\nis not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu\u00ad\ntory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has\nundoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted\npower to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so\nlong as those rules regulate matters \u201crationally capable of\nclassification\u201d as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In\nthe Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28\nU. S.

Each\nof these rules had some practical effect on the parties\u2019\nrights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for\nenforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,\nthe available remedies, or the rules of decision by which\nthe court adjudicated either.\n   Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules\nallowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi\u00ad\n14      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder\nof parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules\nneither change plaintiffs\u2019 separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants\u2019 rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23\u2014at\nleast insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\nseparate claims against the same defendants in a class\naction\u2014falls within \u00a72072(b)\u2019s authorization. A class\naction, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a\nspecies), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate\nclaims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate\nsuits.

Allstate\u2019s aggre\u00ad\ngate liability, however, does not depend on whether the\nsuit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus\nmembers of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl\u00ad\nedges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual\nclaim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who\nwould not bring individual suits for the relatively small\nsums involved will choose to join a class action. That has\nno bearing, however, on Allstate\u2019s or the plaintiffs\u2019 legal\nrights.

To\nbegin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of\n\u00a7901(b) (which is to be found in New York\u2019s procedural\ncode) confines it to claims under New York law; and of\ncourse New York has no power to alter substantive rights\nand duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,\nthe consequence of excluding certain class actions may be\nto cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,\nbut the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,\n\u00a7901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple\njoinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even\nif \u00a7901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted \u201cfor\nsubstantive reasons,\u201d id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end\nwas not to improve \u201cthe conduct of the litigation process\nitself\u201d but to alter \u201cthe outcome of that process.\u201d Id., at 26.\n   The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is\nthat the substantive nature of New York\u2019s law, or its\nsubstantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule\nof Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid\nin others\u2014or valid in some cases and invalid in others\u2014\ndepending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state\nsubstantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for\nsubstantive purposes).

We\nhave held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that\nthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon\nwhether it regulates procedure. See Sibbach, supra, at 14;\nHanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480 U. S., at 8.

Post, at\n5\u20137 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23\nand \u00a7901(b) conflict, post, at 15\u201316, and departs from us\nonly with respect to the second part of the test, i.e.,\nwhether application of the Federal Rule violates \u00a72072(b),\npost, at 7\u201313. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason\ndifferent from ours. Post, at 17\u201322.\n  The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not\nthat Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it dis\u00ad\nplaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not \u201cfunction\nas a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and\nremedies.\u201d Post, at 1. A state procedural rule is not pre\u00ad\nempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is \u201cso bound up with,\u201d or \u201csufficiently intertwined\nwith,\u201d a substantive state-law right or remedy \u201cthat it\ndefines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,\u201d\npost, at 4, 13.\n  This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which\nestablished the rule we apply. The concurrence contends\nthat Sibbach did not rule out its approach, but that is not\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on\nthe idiosyncrasies of state law, Sibbach adopted and ap\u00ad\nplied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal\nRule \u201creally regulates procedure.\u201d 312 U.

Had\nSibbach been applying the concurrence\u2019s theory, that is quite true\u2014\nwhich demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with Sibbach. For\nconformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the very issue Sibbach\ndecided: The petitioner\u2019s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded\nthe Enabling Act\u2019s authorization, 312 U. S., at 9, 13; the Court faced\nand rejected that argument, id., at 13\u201316, and proceeded to reverse\nthe lower court for failing to apply Rule 37 correctly, id., at 16. There\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS.

S., at 113\u2013114, and we see no reason\nto find such an implied limitation today.\n  In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply Sibbach,\nbut to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its\napproach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the\nstatutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from\n\u201cabridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive\nright,\u201d \u00a72072(b). See post, at 9\u201310. There is something to\nthat. It is possible to understand how it can be deter\u00ad\nmined whether a Federal Rule \u201cenlarges\u201d substantive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncould not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now\nadvocates.\n  The concurrence responds that the \u201cthe specific question of \u2018the\nobligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state\u2019 \u201d was\nnot before the Court, post, at 12 (quoting Sibbach, supra, at 9). It is\nclear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie\nprohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion\nunquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules\u2019 compliance with \u00a72072(b),\nand it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,\nwhich does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule\nabridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13\u201314. To the\nextent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules\u2019 validity vis-\u00e0-vis\ncontrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U. S., at 472, and it made\nclear that Sibbach\u2019s test still controls, see 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465,\n470\u2013471.\n  10 The concurrence insists that we have misread Sibbach, since surely\n\na Federal Rule that \u201cin most cases\u201d regulates procedure does not do so\nwhen it displaces one of those \u201crare\u201d state substantive laws that are\ndisguised as rules of procedure. Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what\nthe Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex\u00ad\nplained, supra, at 12\u201313, most Rules have some effect on litigants\u2019\nsubstantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not\nmean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But it is\nhard to understand how it can be determined whether a\nFederal Rule \u201cabridges\u201d or \u201cmodifies\u201d substantive rights\nwithout knowing what state-created rights would obtain if\nthe Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach\u2019s exclusive focus\non the challenged Federal Rule\u2014driven by the very real\nconcern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State\nwould be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13\u201314\u2014is hard to square\nwith \u00a72072(b)\u2019s terms.11\n  Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven\ndecades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a \u201cspecial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The concurrence\u2019s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the\n\nstatute\u2019s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only\nof \u201csubstantive rights,\u201d but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption\nof \u201cprocedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a\nsubstantive right or remedy,\u201d post, at 19. This would allow States to\nforce a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as\nthey are \u201csufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.\u201d Post,\nat 13.\n   12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,\n\napparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13\u201314, n. 14. We\nare unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if\nthe case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,\nthe concurrence\u2019s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag\u00ad\ngerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as\nestablishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465, 470\u2013471.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445\u2013446\n(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the\nFederal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business\nGuides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.\n533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna\u2014\nwhich as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.\nSee Burlington Northern, supra, at 5\u20136, 8; Business Guides, supra, at\n552\u2013554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the\nU. S. Reports, its rule\u2014and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule\nas the proper unit of analysis\u2014is alive and well.\n   In contrast, Hanna\u2019s obscure obiter dictum that a court \u201cneed not\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

We do Congress no service\nby presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate\nhas not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car\u00ad\nried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.\nAlvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast\naside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since\n(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the\nresult.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nwholly blind itself\u201d to a Federal Rule\u2019s effect on a case\u2019s outcome, 380 \n\nU.

Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach\u2019s\nstraightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for\nthat statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency\nbetween the two.\n   13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi\u00ad\n\ntion any rule that \u201creally regulates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, supra, at 14,\nwill pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however \u201cbound up\u201d the latter is\nwith substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that\nresult proves our interpretation of \u00a72072(b) implausible, post, at 10,\nn. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term \u201csubstantive\nrights\u201d in \u00a72072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but\nalso any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the\ntext nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The\nexamples the concurrence offers\u2014statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards\u2014do not\nmake its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They\nmerely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine\nwhether a rule \u201creally regulates\u201d procedure or substance. If one con\u00ad\ncludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal\nRule itself is invalid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See post, at 11, n. 10.\nUndoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have\nmanaged to muddle through well enough in the 69 years\nsince Sibbach was decided). But as the concurrence ac\u00ad\nknowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:\nThe statute itself refers to \u201csubstantive right[s],\u201d \u00a72072(b),\nso there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc\u00ad\ntion. What is more, the concurrence\u2019s approach does\nnothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it\nmany times over. Instead of a single hard question of\nwhether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure,\nthat approach will present hundreds of hard questions,\nforcing federal courts to assess the substantive or proce\u00ad\ndural character of countless state rules that may conflict\nwith a single Federal Rule.14 And it still does not sidestep\nthe problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one\nmust come face to face with the decision whether or not\nthe state policy (with which a putatively procedural state\nrule may be \u201cbound up\u201d) pertains to a \u201csubstantive right or\nremedy,\u201d post, at 19\u2014that is, whether it is substance or\nprocedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  The concurrence\u2019s concern would make more sense if many Federal\nRules that effectively alter state-law rights \u201cbound up with procedures\u201d\nwould survive under Sibbach. But as the concurrence concedes, post, at\n11, n. 10, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier\ninstances does not prove Sibbach\u2019s interpretation is absurd. Congress\nmay well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure.\n  14 The concurrence argues that its approach is no more \u201ctaxing\u201d than\n\nours because few if any Federal Rules that are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under the\nEnabling Act will fail the concurrence\u2019s test. Post, at 11, and n. 10. But\nthat conclusion will be reached only after federal courts have consid\u00ad\nered hundreds of state rules applying the concurrence\u2019s inscrutable\nstandard.\n  15 The concurrence insists that the task will be easier if courts can\n22       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

That is unaccept\u00ad\nable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules\ncreated to fill supposed \u201cgaps\u201d in positive federal law. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471\u2013472. For where neither the Con\u00ad\nstitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of deci\u00ad\nsion or authorizes a federal court to supply one, \u201cstate law\nmust govern because there can be no other law.\u201d Ibid.; see\nClark, Erie\u2019s Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289,\n1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the\nattendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable\n(indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the\npossibility that the same case may follow a different course\nif filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472\u2013473. The short of the matter is that a Federal\nRule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters\nthe outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shop\u00ad\nping. To hold otherwise would be to \u201cdisembowel either the\nConstitution\u2019s grant of power over federal procedure\u201d or\nCongress\u2019s exercise of it.

C. \u00a71652, and make the \u201crelatively unguided Erie\nchoice,\u201d2 Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether\nthe state law is the \u201crule of decision.\u201d But when a situa\ntion is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act\ninquiry by its own terms does not apply. See \u00a71652;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act\n(Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072.\n   That does not mean, however, that the federal rule\nalways governs. Congress has provided for a system of\nuniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts\nsitting in diversity operate as \u201can independent system for\nadministering justice to litigants who properly invoke its\njurisdiction,\u201d Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,\nInc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court\nclones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are\nmanaged by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n473\u2013474. But while Congress may have the constitutional\npower to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with\nstate substantive law in any number of respects, that is\nnot what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in\nthe Enabling Act that although \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u201d\nmay \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\u201d\n\u00a72072(a), those rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b). Therefore, \u201c[w]hen a\nsituation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the\ncourt has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule\u201d\nunless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.\nHanna, 380 U.

Ibid.; see also id., at 469\u2013470. The\nEnabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in\nthe \u201crelatively unguided Erie choice,\u201d id., at 471, but\ninstead instructs only that federal rules cannot \u201cabridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b). The\nEnabling Act\u2019s limitation does not mean that federal rules\ncannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that\nfederal rules cannot displace a State\u2019s definition of its own\nrights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.\n1, 13\u201314 (1941) (reasoning that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantive\nrights\u2019 \u201d embraces only those state rights that are sought\nto be enforced in the judicial proceedings).\n   Congress has thus struck a balance: \u201c[H]ousekeeping\nrules for federal courts\u201d will generally apply in diversity\ncases, notwithstanding that some federal rules \u201cwill inevi\ntably differ\u201d from state rules. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473.\nBut not every federal \u201crul[e] of practice or procedure,\u201d\n\u00a72072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal\nrules must be interpreted with some degree of \u201csensitivity\nto important state interests and regulatory policies,\u201d\nGasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.

And were federal\ncourts to ignore those portions of substantive state law\nthat operate as procedural devices, it could in many in\nstances limit the ways that sovereign States may define\ntheir rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a\ntraditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the\nscope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts\nmust recognize and respect that choice. Cf.

At both steps\nof the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the\nstate law and the federal rule mean.\n   The court must first determine whether the scope of the\nfederal rule is \u201c \u2018sufficiently broad\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018control the issue\u2019 \u201d\nbefore the court, \u201cthereby leaving no room for the opera\ntion\u201d of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington\nNorthern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4\u20135 (1987); Walker\nv. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749\u2013750, and n. 9\n(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate\nalongside the state rule, then there is no \u201cAc[t] of Con\ngress\u201d governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules\nof Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In\nsome instances, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a federal rule will\nnot come into \u201c \u2018direct collision\u2019 \u201d with the state law, and\nboth can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In\nother instances, the rule \u201cwhen fairly construed,\u201d Burling\nton Northern R. Co., 480 U.

Unlike JUSTICE\nSCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that\neffectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created\nright or remedy violates this command. Congress may\nhave the constitutional power \u201cto supplant state law\u201d with\nrules that are \u201crationally capable of classification as pro\ncedure,\u201d ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbut we should generally presume that it has not done so.\nCf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(observing that \u201cwe start with the assumption\u201d that a\nfederal statute does not displace a State\u2019s law \u201cunless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that\nfederal rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right\u201d evinces the opposite intent, as does\nCongress\u2019 decision to delegate the creation of rules to this\nCourt rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).\n  Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back\ninto the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,\nenlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must\nconsider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to\navoid that impermissible result.

See, e.g., Wright \u00a74509,\nat 264, 269\u2013270, 272; Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv.\nL. Rev. 693, 719 (1974) (hereinafter Ely); see also R. Fallon, J. Man\nning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s, The Federal\nCourts and the Federal System 593, n. 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing Ely).\n   8 JUSTICE SCALIA concedes as much, see ante, at 18\u201319, but argues\n\nthat insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might\nviolate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state\nrule, my approach is itself \u201cunfaithful to the statute\u2019s terms,\u201d which\ncover \u201csubstantive rights\u201d but not \u201cprocedural rules,\u201d ante, at 19, n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my\ninterpretation of the Enabling Act\u2014that courts must look to whether a\nfederal rule alters substantive rights in a given case\u2014but simply to the\nway I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that\nregulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might\nactually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s objection, more\nover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears\nprocedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on\nappeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\nA rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really\nbe a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a\nclaim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a\ndefinition of the scope of the claim. These are the sorts of rules that\n10       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

It also ig\nnores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright\n\u00a74509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially\ncreated rules displacing state substantive law.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\none might describe as \u201cprocedural,\u201d but they nonetheless define sub\nstantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the\nfederal rule would have altered the State\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights.\u201d\n   9 The plurality\u2019s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean\n\nthat no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State\u2019s own\nrights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate\n\u201cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\u2019 rights are enforced,\u201d\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are\nmany ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State\u2019s\nformulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,\nalthough in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a\ntemporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to\npromulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in\nsome instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi\nlarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could\neviscerate a critical aspect\u2014albeit one that deals with how a right is\nenforced\u2014of a State\u2019s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal\nrule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages\nare reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state\ndamages cap. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA responds that some of these federal rules might be\ninvalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not \u201creally\nregulat[e] procedure.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 13 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality\u2019s\ntest really is. See n. 10, infra. The response is also limited to those\nrules that can be described as \u201cregulat[ing]\u201d substance, ante, at 13; it\ndoes not address those federal rules that alter the right at issue in the\nlitigation, see Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13\u201314 (1941), only\nwhen they displace particular state laws. JUSTICE SCALIA speculates\nthat \u201cCongress may well have accepted\u201d the occasional alteration of\nsubstantive rights \u201cas the price of a uniform system of federal proce\ndure.\u201d Ante, at 20\u201321, n. 13. Were we forced to speculate about the\nbalance that Congress struck, I might very well agree. But no specula\ntion is necessary because Congress explicitly told us that federal rules\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed\neral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state\nlaw, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina\ntions about whether application of a given rule would\ndisplace a state determination about substantive rights.\nSee ante, at 15, 21\u201322, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an\nEnabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is\nmore taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s.10 But in any event,\nthat inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it\nmay not be easy to decide what is actually a \u201csubstantive\nright,\u201d \u201cthe designations substantive and procedural be\ncome important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.\u201d\nEly 723; see also Wright \u00a74509, at 266. The question,\ntherefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on\nfederal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab\nlished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer\neasily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does\nnot give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of\nthe Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cshall not\u201d alter \u201cany\u201d substantive right. \u00a72072(b).\n   10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28\n\nU. S. C. \u00a72072 will displace a State\u2019s definition of its own substantive\nrights. See Wright \u00a74509, at 272 (observing that \u201cunusual cases\noccasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state\nrule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state\nsubstantive rights\u201d). JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation, moreover, is not\nmuch more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts\u2019 having\nto evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal\nrule is really \u201cprocedural.\u201d It is hard to know the answer to that\nquestion and especially hard to resolve it without considering the\nnature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.\nThe plurality\u2019s \u201c \u2018test\u2019 is no test at all\u2014in a sense, it is little more than\nthe statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce\ndural.\u201d Id., \u00a74509, at 264.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality\nmisreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in\nHanna, \u201cshorthand formulations which have appeared in\nearlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that\nfrequently arise from oversimplification.\u201d 380 U. S., at\n475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is\nfirst necessary to understand the issue that was before the\nCourt. The petitioner raised only the facial question\nwhether \u201cRules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this\ncourt\u201d and not the specific question of \u201cthe obligation of\nfederal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.\u201d11\n312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to\nconsider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not\n\nvalidly address subjects involving \u201cimportant questions of policy,\u201d Supp.\nBrief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of\nRespondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner\nargued only that \u201c[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical\nexamination\u201d is \u201ca \u2018substantive\u2019 right forbidden by Congress\u201d to be\naddressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201ceven though in\ntheory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation\u201d). In\nthe petitioner\u2019s own words, \u201c[t]his contention. . .

Ante, at 15\u201316. But the quoted passage of\nSibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may\n\u201cdeal with\u201d particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality\u2019s\nblock quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to\nthe resolution of the case because the matter at issue,\nrequiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to\n\u201csubstantive rights\u201d under the Enabling Act. Although\nmost state rules bearing on the litigation process are\nadopted for some policy reason, few seemingly \u201cproce\ndural\u201d rules define the scope of a substantive right or\nremedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet\ning federal and state judgments about privacy interests.\nThose privacy concerns may have been weighty and in\nsome sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the\nscope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga\ntion. Thus, in response to the petitioner\u2019s argument in\nSibbach that \u201csubstantive rights\u201d include not only \u201crights\nsought to be adjudicated by the litigants\u201d but also \u201cgeneral\nprinciple[s]\u201d or \u201cquestion[s] of public policy that the legis\nlature is able to pass upon,\u201d id., at 2\u20133, we held that \u201cthe\nphrase \u2018substantive rights\u2019 \u201d embraces only state rights,\nsuch as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be\nenforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13\u201314. If the\nFederal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was\nsufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then\nperhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ\nent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhich the Court explained that the term \u201csubstantive rights\u201d in the\nEnabling Act \u201ccertainly embraces such rights\u201d as \u201crights conferred by\nlaw to be protected and enforced,\u201d such as \u201cthe right not to be injured in\none\u2019s person by another\u2019s negligence\u201d and \u201cto redress [such] infraction.\u201d\nIbid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right \u201cto\nredress [an] infraction,\u201d will depend on the state law that it displaces.\n   13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases \u201creally regu\n\nlates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not \u201creally regulat[e]\nprocedure\u201d when it displaces those rare state rules that, although\n\u201cprocedural\u201d in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the\nrights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is\nprocedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).\n  14 Although this Court\u2019s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n                             III\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as\nwhether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an\nanswer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to\njoin plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that\n\u201cdefines the dimensions\u201d of a state-created claim dictates\nthe opposite answer. Post, at 12. As explained above, I\nreadily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state\nrule that is \u201c \u2018procedural\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the\nterm,\u201d S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently\ninterwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem\nedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the\nfederal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlittle significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural\nfederal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state\nright; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the\nCourt. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach\u2019s statement that the Ena\nbling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated\nby the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13\u201314, for the proposition that \u201ca court, in\nmeasuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the\nEnabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the\nRule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from\nthe course it would follow in state courts,\u201d 380 U. S., at 473. And most\nof our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame\nwork for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned\nSibbach at all but cited only Hanna. See, e.g., Burlington Northern R.\nCo. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 5 (1987).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA notes that in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.\nMurphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946), we used language that supported his\nview. See ante, at 13. But in that case, we contemplated only that the\nFederal Rule in question might have \u201cincidental effects . . . upon the\nrights of litigants,\u201d explaining that \u201c[t]he fact that the application of\nRule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner\u2019s rights to adjudication by\nthe district court for northern Mississippi\u201d rather than southern Mis\nsissippi \u201cwill undoubtedly affect those rights.\u201d 326 U. S., at 445\u2013446.\nThere was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the\nrights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify the rights themselves.\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      15\n\n                          Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthis is not such a case.\nRule 23 Controls Class Certification\n  When the District Court in the case before us was asked\nto certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nsquarely governed the determination whether the court\nshould do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule\n23, therefore, must apply unless its application would\nabridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.\n  Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under\nstand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the\nquestion of class certification in this matter because New\nYork has made a substantive judgment that such a class\nshould not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.\nAlthough, as discussed infra, at 17\u201320, I do not accept the\ndissent\u2019s view of \u00a7901(b), I also do not see how the dis\nsent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent\u2019s premises that a class\n\ncannot be certified. The dissent contends that \u00a7901(b) is a damages\n\u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or \u201cproscription,\u201d post, at 12,\nn. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 \u201cdoes not command that a particular remedy\nbe available when a party sues in a representative capacity,\u201d post, at\n11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the\ndissent\u2019s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question\nwhether petitioner may certify a class, and \u00a7901(b) would be relevant\nonly to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action\nlawsuit, may collect statutory damages.\n   It may be that if the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7901(b) were correct,\nthis class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the\nfederal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(6). But that\nissue was not raised in respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss (from which the\ncase comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the\nCourt. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has \u201cacknowledged\nthat its individual claim\u201d is for less than the required amount in\ncontroversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what\nactual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court\nwere to adopt all of the dissent\u2019s premises, I believe the correct disposi\ntion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of\nwhether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.\n16     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                  Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that courts should \u201cavoi[d]\nimmoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that\nwould trench on state prerogatives,\u201d post, at 3\u20134, and\nshould in some instances \u201cinterpre[t] the federal rules to\navoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,\u201d\npost, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that is\nnot what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule\nshould be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not\nfollow that courts may rewrite the rule.\n   At bottom, the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 seems\nto be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its\napplication would create no Erie problem. The dissent\nwould apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie\neven to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,\nand thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But\n\u201c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,\nthe question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,\nrelatively unguided Erie choice.\u201d Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is\nsatisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro\ntect \u201cstate regulatory policies,\u201d post, at 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach would,\nin my view, work an end run around Congress\u2019 system of\nuniform federal rules, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, and our deci\nsion in Hanna. Federal courts can and should interpret\nfederal rules with sensitivity to \u201cstate prerogatives,\u201d post,\nat 4; but even when \u201cstate interests . . . warrant our re\nspectful consideration,\u201d post, at 8, federal courts cannot\nrewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly\nthat \u00a7901(b) is substantive and that class certification\nshould be denied, then they should argue within the Ena\nbling Act\u2019s framework. Otherwise, \u201cthe Federal Rule\napplies regardless of contrary state law.\u201d Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, n. 7; accord, Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

This inquiry is not always a simple one because\n\u201c[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that\ncannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,\u201d\nWright \u00a74508, at 232\u2013233, and almost \u201cany rule can be\nsaid to have . . . \u2018substantive effects,\u2019 affecting society\u2019s\ndistribution of risks and rewards,\u201d Ely 724, n. 170. Faced\nwith a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition\nally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,\none can often argue that the state rule was really some\npart of the State\u2019s definition of its rights or remedies.\n   In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling\nAct problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law\nis designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a\njudgment about how state courts ought to operate and not\na judgment about the scope of state-created rights and\nremedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal\ncourt system, there are costs involved in attempting to\ndiscover the true nature of a state procedural rule and\nallowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule\nthat appears to govern the same question. The mere\npossibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created\nright is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.\n   The text of CPLR \u00a7901(b) expressly and unambiguously\napplies not only to claims based on New York law but also\nto claims based on federal law or the law of any other\nState. And there is no interpretation from New York\ncourts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how\n\u00a7901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce\ndural in form, serves the function of defining New York\u2019s\nrights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because\nlawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal\nclass actions well before New York passed \u00a7901(b) in 1975,\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is\ntrue, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited\namount of legislative history that can be read to suggest\nthat the New York officials who supported \u00a7901(b) wished\nto create a \u201climitation\u201d on New York\u2019s \u201cstatutory dam\nages.\u201d Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is\nnot the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7\u20138\n(opinion of the Court).\n   The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de\nscribe a judgment that \u00a7901(b) would operate as a limita\ntion on New York\u2019s statutory damages. In evaluating that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns\n\ncreate laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws\nwill apply only within their territory. See post, at 18\u201320. That is a true\nfact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent\u2019s position. For\none thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if\nthere is no conflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7901(b), and the court can thus\napply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the\nonly question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471.      And that inquiry is different from the Rules of\nDecision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469\u2013471.\n   The dissent\u2019s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter\npreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that\nlaws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending\nupon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume\nthat \u201cthe character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined\nwholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,\u201d American\nBanana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the\ncontext of \u00a7901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes\nlittle sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing\nwhat people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed\nto the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.\nThus, \u00a7901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it\nstates that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New\nYork Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear\nclaims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims\nunder New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had\nwritten a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up\n\u00a7901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong\npresumption is to the contrary.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlegislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between\nprocedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem\ningly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the\nscope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost\nevery rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect\non the outcome of litigation, not every state rule \u201cdefines\nthe dimensions of [a] claim itself,\u201d post, at 12. New York\nclearly crafted \u00a7901(b) with the intent that only certain\nlawsuits\u2014those for which there were not statutory penal\nties\u2014could be joined in class actions in New York courts.\nThat decision reflects a policy judgment about which\nlawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class\nform and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care\nfully outlines, see post, at 8\u201310, \u00a7901(b) was \u201capparently\u201d\nadopted in response to fears that the class-action proce\ndure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to \u201c annihi\nlating punishment of the defendant.\u201d V. Alexander, Prac\ntice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.\nCrompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,\n1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par\nticularly strong evidence that \u00a7901(b) serves to define who\ncan obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a\nclass would enlarge New York\u2019s remedy. Any device that\nmakes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to\nrecover damages.\n   In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some\nopponents of a broad class-action device \u201cargued that there\nwas no need to permit class actions in order to encourage\nlitigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an\naggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to\npursue a claim.\u201d Id., at 211, 863 N. E. 2d, at 1015 (em\nphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely\nthat, for any number of reasons, New York courts should\nnot conduct trials in the class format when that format is\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunnecessary to motivate litigation.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG\nasserts that this could not be true because \u201csuits seeking\nstatutory damages are arguably best suited to the class\ndevice because individual proof of actual damages is un\nnecessary.\u201d Post, at 9\u201310. But some people believe that\nclass actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as\nthey join together slightly disparate claims or force courts\nto adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss\nthe possibility that New York legislators shared in those\nbeliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when\nit appeared to be unnecessary.\n   The legislative history of \u00a7901 thus reveals a classically\nprocedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims\nin New York courts (under any source of law) only when it\nis necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the\nclass tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula\ntion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for\nbriefs. There is of course a difference of degree between\nthose examples and class certification, but not a difference\nof kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical\neffect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but\nthat does not transform it into a damages \u201cproscription,\u201d\npost, at 12, n. 6, 21, or \u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,\n25.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature\n\nwould create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply\nonly when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a\nlawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to\nsee how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York\u2019s\npenalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or\nindividual, and that \u00a7901(b) addresses penalties that are created under\nany source of state or federal law.\n   18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter\n\nwould \u201ctransform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.\u201d Post, at 1. But\nin fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one\n$5,000,000 case. It may be that without class certification, not all of\nthe potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

If the applicable federal rule did not\ngovern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly\nread not to do so), then those considerations would matter,\nfor precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See post, at\n17\u201324. But that is not this case. As the Court explained\nin Hanna, it is an \u201cincorrect assumption that the rule of\nErie R. Co. v. Thompkins constitutes the appropriate test\nof . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure.\u201d 380 U. S., at 469\u2013470. \u201cIt is true that both the\nEnabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal\ncourts are to apply state \u2018substantive\u2019 law and federal\n\u2018procedural\u2019 law,\u201d but the tests are different and reflect the\nfact that \u201cthey were designed to control very different\nsorts of decisions.\u201d Id., at 471.\n  Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only\ndecision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case\nwould \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify\u201d New York\u2019s substantive\nrights or remedies. \u00a72072(b). Although one can argue\nthat class certification would enlarge New York\u2019s \u201climited\u201d\ndamages remedy, see post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, such\narguments rest on extensive speculation about what the\nNew York Legislature had in mind when it created\n\u00a7901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing\nnarratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect\nthe plain textual reading of \u00a7901(b), a rule in New York\u2019s\nprocedural code about when to certify class actions\nbrought under any source of law, and respect Congress\u2019\ndecision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal\ncourts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be\nmore than just a possibility that the state rule is different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nprocedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located\n\ncourthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other fea\n\ntures of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue. \n\n22     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state\ncourt, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York\nIns. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over\ndue benefits would, by Shady Grove\u2019s own measure,\namount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal\ncourt based on the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship and request\ning class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for\nthe class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.\nThe New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in\nstructing that, unless specifically permitted, \u201can action to\nrecover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre\nated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a\nclass action.\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \u00a7901(b)\n(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures\nfor the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts\nthe application of \u00a7901(b) in diversity suits.\n  The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New\nYork\u2019s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.\n2        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.\n   The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal\ncourts from generating substantive law in diversity ac\ntions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as\npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a\npolicy of prime importance to our federal system. We have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, \u201c[t]he laws of the several\n\nstates, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or\nActs of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in\ncases where they apply.\u201d 28 U.

York, 326\nU. S. 99, 110 (1945).\n  The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,\nauthorizes us to \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and\nprocedure\u201d for the federal courts, but with a crucial re\nstriction: \u201cSuch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072. Pursuant to\nthis statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ\ning, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the\nlimits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard\nCorp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act\ncounsels against \u201cadventurous application\u201d of Rule 23; any\ntension with the Act \u201cis best kept within tolerable limits.\u201d);\nAmchem Products, Inc. v.

S. 497, 503\u2013504 (2001).\n  If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts\nwith state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with\nthe Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 469\u2013474. If, however, no Federal\nRule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision\nAct, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs\nfederal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when\nfailure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield\nmarkedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing\nthat the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act\nsimultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we\nhave endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within\nthe bounds of both congressional directives.\n                              B\n   In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men\ntioned in the Court\u2019s opinion, we have avoided immoderate\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Rule of Procedure encompasses a\nparticular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi\ncant disuniformity between state and federal courts\nshould be avoided if the text permits.\u201d).\n   In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the\nFederal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer\nv. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the\nCourt read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de\nfenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed\ndefenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in\nsuch cases, Palmer held, state law controls.\n   Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &\nWarehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that\nstate law determines when a diversity suit commences for\npurposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although\nFederal Rule 3 specified that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced\nby filing a complaint with the court,\u201d we held that the\nRule did not displace a state law that tied an action\u2019s\ncommencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531\u2013\n533. The \u201ccause of action [wa]s created by local law,\u201d the\nCourt explained, therefore \u201cthe measure of it [wa]s to be\nfound only in local law.\u201d Id., at 533.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Similarly in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,\n337 U. S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver\nsity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq\nuisite to pursuit of a stockholder\u2019s derivative action, to\npost a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga\ntion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff\u2019s insti\ntution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the\nFederal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder\u2019s\nmaintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no\nconflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques\ntion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court\nobserved. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for\ncosts requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors\ncould not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the\nfederal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction.\n   In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, \u201cthe\nscope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing\nparty urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule\nwhich covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the\nenforcement of state law.\u201d 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna\nitself, the Court found the clash \u201cunavoidable,\u201d ibid.; the\npetitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by\nFederal Rule 4(d)(1), but that \u201chow-to\u201d method did not\nsatisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service\non an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the\nMassachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce\ndure, however, \u201c[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .\nthat federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts\napplying them, and that the process of interpretation can\nand should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter\nests.\u201d R.

S., at 749\u2013752. Rule 3, we said, addresses\nonly \u201cthe date from which various timing requirements of\nthe Federal Rules begin to run,\u201d id., at 751, and does not\n\u201cpurpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,\u201d id., at 750\u2013751.\nSignificant state policy interests would be frustrated, we\nobserved, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state\nrule, which required actual service on the defendant to\nstop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750\u2013\n752.\n   We were similarly attentive to a State\u2019s regulatory\npolicy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the\nstandard for determining when the large size of a jury\nverdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts\nalike had generally employed a \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test\nin reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,\nat 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule\n59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed\nthat a trial court could grant a new trial \u201cfor any of the\nreasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted\nin actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide\ngreater control, New York prescribed procedures under\nwhich jury verdicts would be examined to determine\nwhether they \u201cdeviate[d] materially from what would be\nreasonable compensation.\u201d See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n423\u2013425 (quoting CPLR \u00a75501(c)). This Court held that\nRule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of\nNew York\u2019s invigorated test.\n   Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim\npreclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a\ndiversity action on the basis of a California statute of\nlimitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

(Plaintiff chose Maryland because\nthat State\u2019s limitations period had not yet run.) We held\nthat Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun\ntary dismissal \u201coperate[d] as an adjudication on the mer\nits,\u201d did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in\nMaryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary\nland courts from entertaining the case, we said, \u201cwould\narguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules\nEnabling Act,\u201d 531 U. S., at 503, and \u201cwould in many cases\nviolate [Erie\u2019s] federalism principle,\u201d id., at 504.\n   In sum, both before and after Hanna, the above\ndescribed decisions show, federal courts have been cau\ntioned by this Court to \u201cinterpre[t] the Federal Rules . . .\nwith sensitivity to important state interests,\u201d Gasperini,\n518 U.

As originally drafted, the\nlegislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class\nactions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for\ncertification, eventually codified at \u00a7901(a), that closely\ntracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR \u00a7901(a) (requir\ning, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,\ntypicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).\n   While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New\nYork Legislature\u2019s hopper, \u201cvarious groups advocated for\nthe addition of a provision that would prohibit class action\nplaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmirror reality, as I later explain.

New York\u2019s decision\ninstead to block class-action proceedings for statutory\ndamages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means\nto a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant\u2019s\nliability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbi\ntant inflation of penalties\u2014remedies the New York Legis\nlature created with individual suits in mind.3\n                              D\n   Shady Grove contends\u2014and the Court today agrees\u2014\nthat Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York\u2019s prohibi\ntion on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions.\nThe Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes, states that\nShady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay be\u201d maintained as a class action,\nwhich conflicts with \u00a7901(b)\u2019s instruction that it \u201cmay not\u201d\nso proceed.

See, e.g., Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 476\n(1978). When representative plaintiffs seek statutory damages, pres\nsure to settle may be heightened because a class action poses the risk of\nmassive liability unmoored to actual injury.

Mindful of the history behind \u00a7901(b)\u2019s enact\nment, the thrust of our precedent, and the substantive\nrights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act, I conclude, as\ndid the Second Circuit and every District Court to have\nconsidered the question in any detail,4 that Rule 23 does\nnot collide with \u00a7901(b). As the Second Circuit well un\nderstood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to\nclass certification and postcertification proceedings\u2014but it\ndoes not command that a particular remedy be available\nwhen a party sues in a representative capacity. See 549\nF. 3d 137, 143 (2008).5 Section 901(b), in contrast, trains\non that latter issue.

[to] look to state rules\nand decisional law rather than to Rule 23 . . . in making their class\ncertification decisions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 55. This slippery-slope\nprojection is both familiar and false. Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of\nAmerica 169 (1990) (\u201cJudges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of\nanalogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.\u201d). In this case,\nCPLR \u00a7901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,\nbut Allstate does not contend that \u00a7901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for\nRespondent 18 (\u201cThere is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica\ntion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground\nsquarely occupied by Rule 23.\u201d). Federal courts sitting in diversity have\nroutinely applied Rule 23\u2019s certification standards, rather than compa\nrable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\nExport Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18\u201324 (CA1 2008); Order and\nReasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.\nAction No. 05\u20134182 (ED La., Aug. 6, 2009).\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing\na claim for relief, while \u00a7901(b) defines the dimensions of\nthe claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that\n\u00a7901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than\nretail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have\nembedded the limitation in every provision creating a\ncause of action for which a penalty is authorized; \u00a7901(b)\noperates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a\npart of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be\nwere it included claim by claim in the New York Code.\n  The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit\n\u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d be maintained as a class action. See\nante, at 4\u20136. Putting the question that way, the Court\ndoes not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes\nclass treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be\ncause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and\nefficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section\n901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does\nnot allow class members to recover statutory damages\nbecause the New York Legislature considered the result of\nadjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The\nfair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti\nmate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of\nstate law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State\u2019s\nlawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The\nIrrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 722\n(1974) (It is relevant \u201cwhether the state provision embod\nies a substantive policy or represents only a procedural\ndisagreement with the federal rulemakers respecting the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court disputes the strength of the evidence of legislative intent,\n\nsee ante, at 9, but offers no alternative account of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s purpose.\nPerhaps this silence indicates how very hard it would be to ascribe to\n\u00a7901(b) any purpose bound up with the fairness and efficiency of\nprocessing cases. On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme\ndies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit. Legislative\nhistory confirms this objective, but is not essential to revealing it.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nnotion that one directly impinges on Rule 23\u2019s domain,\nwhile the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the\noffice of Rule 23.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 There   is, of course, a difference between \u201cjustly administering [a]\nremedy,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941), and prescrib\ning the content of that remedy; if Rule 23 can be read to increase a\nplaintiff\u2019s recovery from $1,000,000 to some greater amount, the Rule\nhas arguably \u201cenlarge[d] . . . [a] substantive right\u201d in violation of the\nRules Enabling Act. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b). The plurality appears to\nacknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found\nto be in compliance with the Act have not \u201caltered . . . available reme\ndies.\u201d Ante, at 13. But the Court\u2019s relentless reading of Rule 23 today\ndoes exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of\nclass-size statutory damages even though the New York provision\ninstructs that such penalties shall not be available.\n  8 The Court states that \u201c[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect\n\nour perception of legislative purpose.\u201d Ante, at 9. But we can, of\ncourse, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State\u2019s regulatory policy\nto decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See\nsupra, at 3\u20137. Just as we read Federal Rule 3 in Walker v. Armco Steel\nCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 751 (1980), not to govern when a suit commences\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23\nand \u00a7901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that\na federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect\nto both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs seeking\nto vindicate claims for which the State has provided a\nstatutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action\nif they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual\ndamages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative\nclass member who objects can opt out and pursue actual\ndamages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an\nindividual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The Radec Corp.,\n260 F. R. D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); Brzychnalski v. Unesco,\nInc., 35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).9 See also\nAlexander, Practice Commentaries, at 105 (\u201cEven if a\nstatutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most\ncourts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class\nrecovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of\nCPLR 901(b).\u201d). In this manner, the Second Circuit ex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule\nindisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural\npurposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action\nmay be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages\nprescribed by state law. On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of\n\u00a7901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.\n  9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.\n\nIn discussing the remedial bar effected by \u00a7901(b), the bill\u2019s sponsor\nexplained that a \u201cstatutory class action for actual damages would still\nbe permissible.\u201d S.

On this understand\ning, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class\nwaives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v.

In sum,\nwhile phrased as responsive to the question whether\ncertain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b) is unmistakably\naimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that\nremedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.\n  Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves \u00a7901(b) in control of\nthe remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis\npelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which\ncounsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions\nagainst stretching a rule to cover every situation it could\nconceivably reach.10 The Court states that \u201c[t]here is no\nreason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether\nclaims made eligible for class treatment by some other law\nshould be certified as class actions.\u201d Ante, at 5. To the\ncontrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and\nSemtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates\nthe right to recover. See supra, at 4\u20137. That is plainly so\non a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there\nany reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief\nwhen the State that created the remedy disallows its\npursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our\nfederal system should give.\n  Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain\npenalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class\nrelief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for\ncertain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum\nrecovery. See, e.g., 15 U. S.

See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U. S., at 555; cf. Woods v. Inter\nstate Realty Co., 337 U.

Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.\nThey supply \u201csubstantive\u201d law in diversity suits, see York,\n326 U. S., at 109\u2013112, even though, as Shady Grove ac\nknowledges, state courts often apply the forum\u2019s limita\ntions period as a \u201cprocedural\u201d bar to claims arising under\nthe law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 16\u201317.

Similarly, federal courts\nsitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the\nburden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 177 (1943), yet state courts adju\ndicating foreign causes of action often apply their own\nlocal law to this issue. See Restatement \u00a7133 and Re\nporter\u2019s Note.\n   In short, Shady Grove\u2019s effort to characterize \u00a7901(b) as\nsimply \u201cprocedural\u201d cannot successfully elide this funda\nmental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of\nan issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the\nsense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the\nRules of Decision Act commands application of the State\u2019s\nlaw in diversity suits. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9; York, 326 U. S., at 109. As\nthis case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising\ndiversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award\nstatutory penalties in class actions while New York courts\nare bound by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s proscription, \u201csubstantial varia\ntions between state and federal [money judgments] may be\nexpected.\u201d Gasperini, 518 U.

By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a\nclass action, \u00a7901(b) controls a defendant\u2019s maximum\nliability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial\nprovision could have been written as an explicit cap: \u201cIn\nany class action seeking statutory damages, relief is lim\nited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recov\nered in an individual suit.\u201d That New York\u2019s Legislature\nused other words to express the very same meaning\nshould be inconsequential.\n    We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,\nin a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created\nremedies.

In\nCAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law\nbased class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,\nat least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in\ncontroversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress\nsought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness\nof some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 109\u201314, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers\nfrom \u201cgam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide\nor multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges\nhave reputations for readily certifying classes.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving \u201cthe \u2018I\nnever met a class action I didn\u2019t like\u2019 approach to class\ncertification\u201d that \u201cis prevalent in state courts in some\nlocalities\u201d).

CO.\n                            Syllabus\n\n       (b) Rule 23(b) answers the question in dispute\u2014whether Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit may proceed as a class action\u2014when it states that \u201c[a]\n    class action may be maintained\u201d if certain conditions are met. Since\n    \u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as a class action\u201d because of the\n    relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless\n    Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit\u2019s view that \u00a7901(b) and\n    Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil\n    ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23\n    explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case\n    meeting its criteria. Allstate\u2019s arguments based on the exclusion of\n    some federal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach pursuant to federal statutes\n    and on \u00a7901\u2019s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (c) The dissent\u2019s claim that \u00a7901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be\n    cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is\n    foreclosed by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.\n    The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to\n    avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), does\n    not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent\u2019s approach does not\n    avoid a conflict between \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren\n    der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II\u2013B and II\u2013D:\n       (a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, not Erie, controls\n    the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)\u2019s re\n    quirement that federal procedural rules \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or mod\n    ify any substantive right\u201d means that a Rule must \u201creally regulat[e]\n    procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec\n    ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and\n    redress for disregard or infraction of them,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n    312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party\u2019s\n    rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing\n    those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,\n    or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that\n    criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\n    separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate\u2019s arguments\n    asserting \u00a7901(b)\u2019s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the\n    substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat\n    ters, but that of the Federal Rule. See, e.g., id., at 14. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (b) Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in\n    state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable re\n    sult of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress cre\n    ated.

Pp. 16\u201322.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n  must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and\n  it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case. Pp. 1\u201322.\n            (a) When the application of a federal rule would \u201cabridge,\n  enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), the\n  federal rule cannot govern. In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates\n  an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied,\n  displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use\n  of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it\n  functions to define the scope of the state-created right. Examples\n  may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to\n  bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of\n  recovery.

A., provided medical care\nto Sonia E. Galvez for injuries she suffered in an automo\u00ad\nbile accident. As partial payment for that care, Galvez\nassigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits\nunder a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance\nCo. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene\u00ad\nfits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to\npay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a)\n(West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time,\nand it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on\nthe overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see ibid.\n   Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York to recover the unpaid statutory in\u00ad\nterest.

Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), which pre\u00ad\ncludes a suit to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d from proceeding as a\nclass action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,\ndespite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding\nthat statutory interest is a \u201cpenalty\u201d under New York law,\nit held that \u00a7901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.\nAnd, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim\n(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in\u00ad\ncontroversy requirement for individual suits under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The\ncourt did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com\u00ad\npliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072,\nwould control if it conflicted with \u00a7901(b). But there was\nno conflict because (as we will describe in more detail\nbelow) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and\n\u00a7901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule\non point, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7901(b) is \u201csub\u00ad\nstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U. S. 64 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal\ncourts sitting in diversity.\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U.

If it does, it governs\u2014New York\u2019s law not\u00ad\nwithstanding\u2014unless it exceeds statutory authorization or\nCongress\u2019s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.\nPlumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463\u2013464 (1965). We do not wade\ninto Erie\u2019s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli\u00ad\ncable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469\u2013471.\n                              A\n   The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove\u2019s suit\nmay proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an\u00ad\nswer. It states that \u201c[a] class action may be maintained\u201d if\ntwo conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria\nset forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also\nmust fit into one of the three categories described in sub\u00ad\ndivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this\ncreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit\nmeets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class\naction. (The Federal Rules regularly use \u201cmay\u201d to confer\ncategorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n8(d)(2)\u2013(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)\u2013(b), 20(a)(1)\u2013(2), 27(a)(1),\n30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural\nentitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all\nformula for deciding the class-action question. Because\n\u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question\u2014i.e., it\nstates that Shady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as\na class action\u201d (emphasis added) because of the relief it\nseeks\u2014it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.\n   The Second Circuit believed that \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 do\nnot conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,\nit said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether\na given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on\nthe other hand, addresses an antecedent question:\nwhether the particular type of claim is eligible for class\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                 the Court\n\ntreatment in the first place\u2014a question on which Rule 23\nis silent. See 549 F. 3d, at 143\u2013144. Allstate embraces\nthis analysis. Brief for Respondent 12\u201313.\n   We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility\nand certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi\u00ad\ntions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that\neligibility must depend on the \u201cparticular cause of action\u201d\nasserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at\n12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro\u00ad\nvide that only claims involving more than a certain num\u00ad\nber of plaintiffs are \u201celigible\u201d for class treatment in federal\ncourt. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)\u2019s prerequi\u00ad\nsites \u201celigibility criteria\u201d would obviate Allstate\u2019s objec\u00ad\ntion\u2014a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc\u00ad\ntion is made-to-order.\n   There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as\naddressing only whether claims made eligible for class\ntreatment by some other law should be certified as class\nactions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly\nnor implicitly empowers a federal court \u201cto certify a class\nin each and every case\u201d where the Rule\u2019s criteria are met.\nId., at 13\u201314. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It\nsays that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied \u201c[a]\nclass action may be maintained\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014not \u201ca\nclass action may be permitted.\u201d Courts do not maintain\nactions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23\u2019s\n\u201cmay\u201d is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring\nhis claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati\ncally applies \u201cin all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699\u2013700 (1979).\n   Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some\nfederal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(e)(1)(B)\u2014which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule\n23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but\n6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\nrather leaves room for laws like \u00a7901(b). But Congress,\nunlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an\nindividual rule as it sees fit\u2014either by directly amending\nthe rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in\ncertain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517\nU. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created\nspecific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule\ndoes not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If\nRule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,\nthe statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.\n  Allstate next suggests that the structure of \u00a7901 shows\nthat Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),\nit notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly\nanalogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that\nsubsection is pre-empted). But \u00a7901(b)\u2019s rule barring class\nactions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,\nand where it applies \u00a7901(a) does not. This shows, accord\u00ad\ning to Allstate, that \u00a7901(b) concerns a separate subject.\nPerhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub\u00ad\nject of \u00a7901(a). But the question before us is whether it\nconcerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23\u2014\nand for purposes of answering that question the way New\nYork has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23\npermits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a\nState cannot limit that permission by structuring one part\nof its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part\nthat imposes additional requirements. Both of \u00a7901\u2019s\nsubsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule\n23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.\nCf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7\u20138.\n  The dissent argues that \u00a7901(b) has nothing to do with\nwhether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class\naction, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.\nSee post, at 8\u201317 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.).

Accordingly, the dissent says,\nRule 23 and New York\u2019s law may coexist in peace.\n   We need not decide whether a state law that limits the\nremedies available in an existing class action would con\u00ad\nflict with Rule 23; that is not what \u00a7901(b) does. By its\nterms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from \u201cmain\u00ad\ntain[ing]\u201d a class action seeking statutory penalties.\nUnlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other\nremedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,\n\u00a7901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may\naward; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming\ninto existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by\n\u00a7901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu\u00ad\ntory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in\nadvance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the\nevent the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the\nstatute\u2019s clear prohibition on \u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such suits as\nclass actions.\n   The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid \u00a7901(b)\u2019s\nbarrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a\nrequest for statutory penalties. See post, at 14\u201315. Even\nassuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, post, at 13, we express no view\n\nas to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a\nsingle suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.\nWhether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, \u00a7901(b) does conflict\nbecause it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main\u00ad\ntain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal\nstatutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. \u00a72605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal\nRules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case\nof a conflict.\n   5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737\n8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                                the Court\n\nthat a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class\naction would not at all prove that \u00a7901(b) is addressed\nonly to remedies. If the state law instead banned class\nactions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff\ncould drop the fraud counts from his complaint and pro\u00ad\nceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would\nnot mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban\nwould affect only the procedural means by which the\nremedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent\ncorrectly abandons Allstate\u2019s eligibility-certifiability dis\u00ad\ntinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.\n  The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of\n\u00a7901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23\u2014i.e., whether\na class action may be maintained\u2014but insists the provi\u00ad\nsion\u2019s purpose is to restrict only remedies. See post, at 12\u2013\n15; post, at 15 (\u201c[W]hile phrased as responsive to the\nquestion whether certain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b)\nis unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions\nmust end\u201d). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further proce\u00ad\ndural fairness and efficiency, \u00a7901(b) (we are told) \u201cre\u00ad\nsponds to an entirely different concern\u201d: the fear that\nallowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide\nbasis would \u201cproduce overkill.\u201d Post, at 12, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent reaches this con\u00ad\nclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in\nthe law\u2019s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the\nLegislature \u201capparently fear[ed]\u201d that combining class\nactions and statutory penalties \u201ccould result in annihilat\u00ad\ning punishment of the defendant,\u201d V.

Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863\nN. E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).\n  This evidence of the New York Legislature\u2019s purpose is\npretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent\u2019s account of\nthe Legislature\u2019s objective at face value, it cannot override\nthe statute\u2019s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the\nremedy a plaintiff can obtain, \u00a7901(b) achieves that end by\nlimiting a plaintiff\u2019s power to maintain a class action. The\nmanner in which the law \u201ccould have been written,\u201d post,\nat 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla\u00ad\nture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our\nperception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380 (1998).6 The\ndissent\u2019s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated\nrather than furthered by revising state laws when a po\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Our  decision in Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),\ndiscussed by the dissent, post, at 5\u20136, 13\u201314, n. 8, is not to the contrary.\nThere we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is\n\u201c \u2018commenced\u2019 \u201d by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a\nstate law providing that \u201c \u2018[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,\nwithin the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each\ndefendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .\u2019 \u201d\n446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, \u00a797 (1971); altera\u00ad\ntion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, \u201cgoverns the\ndate from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules\nbegin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations\u201d or tolling\nrules, which it did not \u201cpurpor[t] to displace.\u201d 446 U. S., at 751, 750.\nThe texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed\nthat the State\u2019s actual-service rule was (in the State\u2019s judgment) an\n\u201cintegral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita\u00ad\ntions,\u201d id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court\nmay resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal\nrules by resorting to the state law\u2019s ostensible objectives.\n10     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\ntential conflict with a Federal Rule arises; the state\u00ad\nfriendly approach would be to accept the law as written\nand test the validity of the Federal Rule.\n   The dissent\u2019s approach of determining whether state\nand federal rules conflict based on the subjective inten\u00ad\ntions of the state legislature is an enterprise destined to\nproduce \u201cconfusion worse confounded,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson\n& Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941). It would mean, to begin\nwith, that one State\u2019s statute could survive pre-emption\n(and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court)\nwhile another State\u2019s identical law would not, merely\nbecause its authors had different aspirations. It would\nalso mean that district courts would have to discern, in\nevery diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively\npre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely\nconflicts with federal law. That task will often prove\narduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the\naim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to\nthe extent the dissent\u2019s purpose-driven approach depends\non its characterization of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s aims as substantive, it\nwould apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to\nprocedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody\npolicy preferences about the types of claims that should\nsucceed\u2014as do rules governing summary judgment, pre\u00ad\ntrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.\nHard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state\nsupreme court\u2019s pronouncement of the law\u2019s purpose\nwould settle the issue, since existence of the factual predi\u00ad\ncate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a fed\u00ad\neral question. Predictably, federal judges would be con\u00ad\ndemned to poring through state legislative history\u2014which\nmay be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less famil\u00ad\niar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky & D. Dunn,\nFundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Tor\u00ad\nres & Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, An\u00ad\nnotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib.

The central difficulty is that even artificial\nnarrowing cannot render \u00a7901(b) compatible with Rule 23.\nWhatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict\neach other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see\npost, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in\na manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat\u00ad\nute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings\u2014one\nthat would violate \u00a72072(b) and another that would not\u2014\nwe would agree. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 842, 845 (1999); cf. Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. v. Lockheed\nMartin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 503\u2013504 (2001). But it is not.\nRule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any\nfederal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the\nRule\u2019s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text,\neven to avert a collision with state law that might render\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The    dissent also suggests that we should read the Federal Rules\n\u201c \u2018with sensitivity to important state interests\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018to avoid conflict\nwith important state regulatory policies.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 7 (quoting Gasperini\nv. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427, n. 7, 438, n. 22\n(1996)). The search for state interests and policies that are \u201cimportant\u201d\nis just as standardless as the \u201cimportant or substantial\u201d criterion we\nrejected in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13\u201314 (1941), to define\nthe state-created rights a Federal Rule may not abridge.\n   If all the dissent means is that we should read an ambiguous Federal\nRule to avoid \u201csubstantial variations [in outcomes] between state and\nfederal litigation,\u201d Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S.\n497, 504 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), we entirely agree.\nWe should do so not to avoid doubt as to the Rule\u2019s validity\u2014since a\nFederal Rule that fails Erie\u2019s forum-shopping test is not ipso facto\ninvalid, see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469\u2013472 (1965)\u2014but\nbecause it is reasonable to assume that \u201cCongress is just as concerned\nas we have been to avoid significant differences between state and\nfederal courts in adjudicating claims,\u201d Stewart Organization, Inc. v.\nRicoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22, 37\u201338 (1988) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The\nassumption is irrelevant here, however, because there is only one\nreasonable reading of Rule 23.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS.

S. 740,\n750, n. 9 (1980).8 What the dissent\u2019s approach achieves is\nnot the avoiding of a \u201cconflict between Rule 23 and\n\u00a7901(b),\u201d post, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23\n(pursuant to \u00a72072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the\nextent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of\n\u00a7901. There is no other way to reach the dissent\u2019s destina\u00ad\ntion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule\n23 falls within the statutory authorization.\n                               B\n   Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts\nto supplant state law with judge-made rules. In that\ncontext, it made no difference whether the rule was tech\u00ad\nnically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was\nwhether it \u201csignificantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.\u201d\nGuaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That\nis not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu\u00ad\ntory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has\nundoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted\npower to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so\nlong as those rules regulate matters \u201crationally capable of\nclassification\u201d as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In\nthe Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28\nU. S.

Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 113\u2013\n114 (1964) (same). Likewise, we have upheld rules au\u00ad\nthorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file\nfrivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed.

Each\nof these rules had some practical effect on the parties\u2019\nrights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for\nenforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,\nthe available remedies, or the rules of decision by which\nthe court adjudicated either.\n   Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules\nallowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi\u00ad\n14      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder\nof parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules\nneither change plaintiffs\u2019 separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants\u2019 rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23\u2014at\nleast insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\nseparate claims against the same defendants in a class\naction\u2014falls within \u00a72072(b)\u2019s authorization. A class\naction, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a\nspecies), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate\nclaims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate\nsuits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties\u2019\nlegal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision\nunchanged.\n   Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions\nis not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue\non behalf of a class \u201ctransform[s] [the] dispute over a five\nhundred dollar penalty into a dispute over a five million\ndollar penalty.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate\u2019s aggre\u00ad\ngate liability, however, does not depend on whether the\nsuit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus\nmembers of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl\u00ad\nedges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual\nclaim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who\nwould not bring individual suits for the relatively small\nsums involved will choose to join a class action. That has\nno bearing, however, on Allstate\u2019s or the plaintiffs\u2019 legal\nrights.

To\nbegin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of\n\u00a7901(b) (which is to be found in New York\u2019s procedural\ncode) confines it to claims under New York law; and of\ncourse New York has no power to alter substantive rights\nand duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,\nthe consequence of excluding certain class actions may be\nto cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,\nbut the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,\n\u00a7901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple\njoinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even\nif \u00a7901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted \u201cfor\nsubstantive reasons,\u201d id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end\nwas not to improve \u201cthe conduct of the litigation process\nitself\u201d but to alter \u201cthe outcome of that process.\u201d Id., at 26.\n   The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is\nthat the substantive nature of New York\u2019s law, or its\nsubstantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule\nof Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid\nin others\u2014or valid in some cases and invalid in others\u2014\ndepending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state\nsubstantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for\nsubstantive purposes). That could not be clearer in\nSibbach:\n    \u201cThe petitioner says the phrase [\u2018substantive rights\u2019 in\n    the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use\n    Congress intended that in regulating procedure this\n    Court should not deal with important and substantial\n    rights theretofore recognized.

We\nhave held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that\nthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon\nwhether it regulates procedure.

Post, at\n5\u20137 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23\nand \u00a7901(b) conflict, post, at 15\u201316, and departs from us\nonly with respect to the second part of the test, i.e.,\nwhether application of the Federal Rule violates \u00a72072(b),\npost, at 7\u201313. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason\ndifferent from ours. Post, at 17\u201322.\n  The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not\nthat Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it dis\u00ad\nplaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not \u201cfunction\nas a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and\nremedies.\u201d Post, at 1. A state procedural rule is not pre\u00ad\nempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is \u201cso bound up with,\u201d or \u201csufficiently intertwined\nwith,\u201d a substantive state-law right or remedy \u201cthat it\ndefines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,\u201d\npost, at 4, 13.\n  This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which\nestablished the rule we apply. The concurrence contends\nthat Sibbach did not rule out its approach, but that is not\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on\nthe idiosyncrasies of state law, Sibbach adopted and ap\u00ad\nplied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal\nRule \u201creally regulates procedure.\u201d 312 U.

Had\nSibbach been applying the concurrence\u2019s theory, that is quite true\u2014\nwhich demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with Sibbach. For\nconformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the very issue Sibbach\ndecided: The petitioner\u2019s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded\nthe Enabling Act\u2019s authorization, 312 U. S., at 9, 13; the Court faced\nand rejected that argument, id., at 13\u201316, and proceeded to reverse\nthe lower court for failing to apply Rule 37 correctly, id., at 16. There\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe concurrence\u2019s approach would have yielded the same\nresult in Sibbach proves nothing; what matters is the rule\nwe did apply, and that rule leaves no room for special\nexemptions based on the function or purpose of a particu\u00ad\nlar state rule.10 We have rejected an attempt to read into\nSibbach an exception with no basis in the opinion, see\nSchlagenhauf, 379 U. S., at 113\u2013114, and we see no reason\nto find such an implied limitation today.\n  In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply Sibbach,\nbut to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its\napproach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the\nstatutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from\n\u201cabridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive\nright,\u201d \u00a72072(b). See post, at 9\u201310. There is something to\nthat. It is possible to understand how it can be deter\u00ad\nmined whether a Federal Rule \u201cenlarges\u201d substantive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncould not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now\nadvocates.\n  The concurrence responds that the \u201cthe specific question of \u2018the\nobligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state\u2019 \u201d was\nnot before the Court, post, at 12 (quoting Sibbach, supra, at 9). It is\nclear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie\nprohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion\nunquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules\u2019 compliance with \u00a72072(b),\nand it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,\nwhich does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule\nabridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13\u201314. To the\nextent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules\u2019 validity vis-\u00e0-vis\ncontrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U. S., at 472, and it made\nclear that Sibbach\u2019s test still controls, see 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465,\n470\u2013471.\n  10 The concurrence insists that we have misread Sibbach, since surely\n\na Federal Rule that \u201cin most cases\u201d regulates procedure does not do so\nwhen it displaces one of those \u201crare\u201d state substantive laws that are\ndisguised as rules of procedure. Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what\nthe Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex\u00ad\nplained, supra, at 12\u201313, most Rules have some effect on litigants\u2019\nsubstantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not\nmean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But it is\nhard to understand how it can be determined whether a\nFederal Rule \u201cabridges\u201d or \u201cmodifies\u201d substantive rights\nwithout knowing what state-created rights would obtain if\nthe Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach\u2019s exclusive focus\non the challenged Federal Rule\u2014driven by the very real\nconcern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State\nwould be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13\u201314\u2014is hard to square\nwith \u00a72072(b)\u2019s terms.11\n  Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven\ndecades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a \u201cspecial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The concurrence\u2019s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the\n\nstatute\u2019s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only\nof \u201csubstantive rights,\u201d but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption\nof \u201cprocedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a\nsubstantive right or remedy,\u201d post, at 19. This would allow States to\nforce a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as\nthey are \u201csufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.\u201d Post,\nat 13.\n   12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,\n\napparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13\u201314, n. 14. We\nare unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if\nthe case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,\nthe concurrence\u2019s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag\u00ad\ngerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as\nestablishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465, 470\u2013471.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445\u2013446\n(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the\nFederal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business\nGuides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.\n533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna\u2014\nwhich as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.\nSee Burlington Northern, supra, at 5\u20136, 8; Business Guides, supra, at\n552\u2013554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the\nU. S. Reports, its rule\u2014and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule\nas the proper unit of analysis\u2014is alive and well.\n   In contrast, Hanna\u2019s obscure obiter dictum that a court \u201cneed not\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

And a party\nseeking to overturn a statutory precedent bears an even\ngreater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us,\nibid., and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see,\ne.g., Finley v.

We do Congress no service\nby presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate\nhas not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car\u00ad\nried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.\nAlvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast\naside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since\n(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the\nresult.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nwholly blind itself\u201d to a Federal Rule\u2019s effect on a case\u2019s outcome, 380 \n\nU.

Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach\u2019s\nstraightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for\nthat statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency\nbetween the two.\n   13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi\u00ad\n\ntion any rule that \u201creally regulates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, supra, at 14,\nwill pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however \u201cbound up\u201d the latter is\nwith substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that\nresult proves our interpretation of \u00a72072(b) implausible, post, at 10,\nn. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term \u201csubstantive\nrights\u201d in \u00a72072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but\nalso any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the\ntext nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The\nexamples the concurrence offers\u2014statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards\u2014do not\nmake its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They\nmerely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine\nwhether a rule \u201creally regulates\u201d procedure or substance. If one con\u00ad\ncludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal\nRule itself is invalid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See post, at 11, n. 10.\nUndoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have\nmanaged to muddle through well enough in the 69 years\nsince Sibbach was decided). But as the concurrence ac\u00ad\nknowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:\nThe statute itself refers to \u201csubstantive right[s],\u201d \u00a72072(b),\nso there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc\u00ad\ntion. What is more, the concurrence\u2019s approach does\nnothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it\nmany times over. Instead of a single hard question of\nwhether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure,\nthat approach will present hundreds of hard questions,\nforcing federal courts to assess the substantive or proce\u00ad\ndural character of countless state rules that may conflict\nwith a single Federal Rule.14 And it still does not sidestep\nthe problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one\nmust come face to face with the decision whether or not\nthe state policy (with which a putatively procedural state\nrule may be \u201cbound up\u201d) pertains to a \u201csubstantive right or\nremedy,\u201d post, at 19\u2014that is, whether it is substance or\nprocedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  The concurrence\u2019s concern would make more sense if many Federal\nRules that effectively alter state-law rights \u201cbound up with procedures\u201d\nwould survive under Sibbach. But as the concurrence concedes, post, at\n11, n. 10, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier\ninstances does not prove Sibbach\u2019s interpretation is absurd. Congress\nmay well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure.\n  14 The concurrence argues that its approach is no more \u201ctaxing\u201d than\n\nours because few if any Federal Rules that are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under the\nEnabling Act will fail the concurrence\u2019s test. Post, at 11, and n. 10. But\nthat conclusion will be reached only after federal courts have consid\u00ad\nered hundreds of state rules applying the concurrence\u2019s inscrutable\nstandard.\n  15 The concurrence insists that the task will be easier if courts can\n22       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nSibbach\u2019s rule, the more its wisdom becomes apparent.\n                                D\n   We must acknowledge the reality that keeping the fed\u00ad\neral-court door open to class actions that cannot proceed in\nstate court will produce forum shopping. That is unaccept\u00ad\nable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules\ncreated to fill supposed \u201cgaps\u201d in positive federal law. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471\u2013472. For where neither the Con\u00ad\nstitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of deci\u00ad\nsion or authorizes a federal court to supply one, \u201cstate law\nmust govern because there can be no other law.\u201d Ibid.; see\nClark, Erie\u2019s Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289,\n1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the\nattendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable\n(indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the\npossibility that the same case may follow a different course\nif filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472\u2013473. The short of the matter is that a Federal\nRule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters\nthe outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shop\u00ad\nping. To hold otherwise would be to \u201cdisembowel either the\nConstitution\u2019s grant of power over federal procedure\u201d or\nCongress\u2019s exercise of it.

C. \u00a71652, and make the \u201crelatively unguided Erie\nchoice,\u201d2 Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether\nthe state law is the \u201crule of decision.\u201d But when a situa\ntion is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act\ninquiry by its own terms does not apply. See \u00a71652;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act\n(Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072.\n   That does not mean, however, that the federal rule\nalways governs. Congress has provided for a system of\nuniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts\nsitting in diversity operate as \u201can independent system for\nadministering justice to litigants who properly invoke its\njurisdiction,\u201d Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,\nInc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court\nclones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are\nmanaged by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n473\u2013474. But while Congress may have the constitutional\npower to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with\nstate substantive law in any number of respects, that is\nnot what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in\nthe Enabling Act that although \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u201d\nmay \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\u201d\n\u00a72072(a), those rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b).

Ibid.; see also id., at 469\u2013470. The\nEnabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in\nthe \u201crelatively unguided Erie choice,\u201d id., at 471, but\ninstead instructs only that federal rules cannot \u201cabridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b). The\nEnabling Act\u2019s limitation does not mean that federal rules\ncannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that\nfederal rules cannot displace a State\u2019s definition of its own\nrights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.\n1, 13\u201314 (1941) (reasoning that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantive\nrights\u2019 \u201d embraces only those state rights that are sought\nto be enforced in the judicial proceedings).\n   Congress has thus struck a balance: \u201c[H]ousekeeping\nrules for federal courts\u201d will generally apply in diversity\ncases, notwithstanding that some federal rules \u201cwill inevi\ntably differ\u201d from state rules. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 473.\nBut not every federal \u201crul[e] of practice or procedure,\u201d\n\u00a72072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal\nrules must be interpreted with some degree of \u201csensitivity\nto important state interests and regulatory policies,\u201d\nGasperini v.

And were federal\ncourts to ignore those portions of substantive state law\nthat operate as procedural devices, it could in many in\nstances limit the ways that sovereign States may define\ntheir rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a\ntraditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the\nscope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts\nmust recognize and respect that choice. Cf.

At both steps\nof the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the\nstate law and the federal rule mean.\n   The court must first determine whether the scope of the\nfederal rule is \u201c \u2018sufficiently broad\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018control the issue\u2019 \u201d\nbefore the court, \u201cthereby leaving no room for the opera\ntion\u201d of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington\nNorthern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4\u20135 (1987); Walker\nv. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749\u2013750, and n. 9\n(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate\nalongside the state rule, then there is no \u201cAc[t] of Con\ngress\u201d governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules\nof Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In\nsome instances, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a federal rule will\nnot come into \u201c \u2018direct collision\u2019 \u201d with the state law, and\nboth can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In\nother instances, the rule \u201cwhen fairly construed,\u201d Burling\nton Northern R. Co., 480 U.

Unlike JUSTICE\nSCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that\neffectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created\nright or remedy violates this command. Congress may\nhave the constitutional power \u201cto supplant state law\u201d with\nrules that are \u201crationally capable of classification as pro\ncedure,\u201d ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbut we should generally presume that it has not done so.\nCf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(observing that \u201cwe start with the assumption\u201d that a\nfederal statute does not displace a State\u2019s law \u201cunless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that\nfederal rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right\u201d evinces the opposite intent, as does\nCongress\u2019 decision to delegate the creation of rules to this\nCourt rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).\n  Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back\ninto the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,\nenlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must\nconsider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to\navoid that impermissible result.

See, e.g., Wright \u00a74509,\nat 264, 269\u2013270, 272; Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv.\nL. Rev. 693, 719 (1974) (hereinafter Ely); see also R. Fallon, J. Man\nning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s, The Federal\nCourts and the Federal System 593, n. 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing Ely).\n   8 JUSTICE SCALIA concedes as much, see ante, at 18\u201319, but argues\n\nthat insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might\nviolate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state\nrule, my approach is itself \u201cunfaithful to the statute\u2019s terms,\u201d which\ncover \u201csubstantive rights\u201d but not \u201cprocedural rules,\u201d ante, at 19, n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my\ninterpretation of the Enabling Act\u2014that courts must look to whether a\nfederal rule alters substantive rights in a given case\u2014but simply to the\nway I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that\nregulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might\nactually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s objection, more\nover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears\nprocedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on\nappeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\nA rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really\nbe a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a\nclaim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a\ndefinition of the scope of the claim. These are the sorts of rules that\n10       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndoing ignores the balance that Congress struck between\nuniform rules of federal procedure and respect for a State\u2019s\nconstruction of its own rights and remedies. It also ig\nnores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright\n\u00a74509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially\ncreated rules displacing state substantive law.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\none might describe as \u201cprocedural,\u201d but they nonetheless define sub\nstantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the\nfederal rule would have altered the State\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights.\u201d\n   9 The plurality\u2019s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean\n\nthat no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State\u2019s own\nrights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate\n\u201cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\u2019 rights are enforced,\u201d\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are\nmany ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State\u2019s\nformulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,\nalthough in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a\ntemporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to\npromulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in\nsome instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi\nlarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could\neviscerate a critical aspect\u2014albeit one that deals with how a right is\nenforced\u2014of a State\u2019s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal\nrule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages\nare reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state\ndamages cap. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA responds that some of these federal rules might be\ninvalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not \u201creally\nregulat[e] procedure.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 13 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality\u2019s\ntest really is. See n. 10, infra.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed\neral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state\nlaw, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina\ntions about whether application of a given rule would\ndisplace a state determination about substantive rights.\nSee ante, at 15, 21\u201322, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an\nEnabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is\nmore taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s.10 But in any event,\nthat inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it\nmay not be easy to decide what is actually a \u201csubstantive\nright,\u201d \u201cthe designations substantive and procedural be\ncome important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.\u201d\nEly 723; see also Wright \u00a74509, at 266. The question,\ntherefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on\nfederal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab\nlished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer\neasily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does\nnot give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of\nthe Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cshall not\u201d alter \u201cany\u201d substantive right. \u00a72072(b).\n   10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28\n\nU. S. C. \u00a72072 will displace a State\u2019s definition of its own substantive\nrights. See Wright \u00a74509, at 272 (observing that \u201cunusual cases\noccasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state\nrule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state\nsubstantive rights\u201d). JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation, moreover, is not\nmuch more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts\u2019 having\nto evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal\nrule is really \u201cprocedural.\u201d It is hard to know the answer to that\nquestion and especially hard to resolve it without considering the\nnature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.\nThe plurality\u2019s \u201c \u2018test\u2019 is no test at all\u2014in a sense, it is little more than\nthe statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce\ndural.\u201d Id., \u00a74509, at 264.\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality\nmisreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in\nHanna, \u201cshorthand formulations which have appeared in\nearlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that\nfrequently arise from oversimplification.\u201d 380 U. S., at\n475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is\nfirst necessary to understand the issue that was before the\nCourt. The petitioner raised only the facial question\nwhether \u201cRules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this\ncourt\u201d and not the specific question of \u201cthe obligation of\nfederal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.\u201d11\n312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to\nconsider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not\n\nvalidly address subjects involving \u201cimportant questions of policy,\u201d Supp.\nBrief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of\nRespondent, O.

Ante, at 15\u201316. But the quoted passage of\nSibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may\n\u201cdeal with\u201d particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality\u2019s\nblock quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to\nthe resolution of the case because the matter at issue,\nrequiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to\n\u201csubstantive rights\u201d under the Enabling Act. Although\nmost state rules bearing on the litigation process are\nadopted for some policy reason, few seemingly \u201cproce\ndural\u201d rules define the scope of a substantive right or\nremedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet\ning federal and state judgments about privacy interests.\nThose privacy concerns may have been weighty and in\nsome sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the\nscope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga\ntion. Thus, in response to the petitioner\u2019s argument in\nSibbach that \u201csubstantive rights\u201d include not only \u201crights\nsought to be adjudicated by the litigants\u201d but also \u201cgeneral\nprinciple[s]\u201d or \u201cquestion[s] of public policy that the legis\nlature is able to pass upon,\u201d id., at 2\u20133, we held that \u201cthe\nphrase \u2018substantive rights\u2019 \u201d embraces only state rights,\nsuch as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be\nenforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13\u201314. If the\nFederal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was\nsufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then\nperhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ\nent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhich the Court explained that the term \u201csubstantive rights\u201d in the\nEnabling Act \u201ccertainly embraces such rights\u201d as \u201crights conferred by\nlaw to be protected and enforced,\u201d such as \u201cthe right not to be injured in\none\u2019s person by another\u2019s negligence\u201d and \u201cto redress [such] infraction.\u201d\nIbid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right \u201cto\nredress [an] infraction,\u201d will depend on the state law that it displaces.\n   13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases \u201creally regu\n\nlates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not \u201creally regulat[e]\nprocedure\u201d when it displaces those rare state rules that, although\n\u201cprocedural\u201d in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the\nrights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is\nprocedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).\n  14 Although this Court\u2019s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n                             III\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as\nwhether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an\nanswer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to\njoin plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that\n\u201cdefines the dimensions\u201d of a state-created claim dictates\nthe opposite answer. Post, at 12. As explained above, I\nreadily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state\nrule that is \u201c \u2018procedural\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the\nterm,\u201d S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently\ninterwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem\nedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the\nfederal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlittle significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural\nfederal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state\nright; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the\nCourt. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach\u2019s statement that the Ena\nbling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated\nby the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13\u201314, for the proposition that \u201ca court, in\nmeasuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the\nEnabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the\nRule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from\nthe course it would follow in state courts,\u201d 380 U. S., at 473. And most\nof our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame\nwork for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned\nSibbach at all but cited only Hanna. See, e.g., Burlington Northern R.\nCo. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 5 (1987).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA notes that in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.\nMurphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946), we used language that supported his\nview. See ante, at 13. But in that case, we contemplated only that the\nFederal Rule in question might have \u201cincidental effects . . . upon the\nrights of litigants,\u201d explaining that \u201c[t]he fact that the application of\nRule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner\u2019s rights to adjudication by\nthe district court for northern Mississippi\u201d rather than southern Mis\nsissippi \u201cwill undoubtedly affect those rights.\u201d 326 U. S., at 445\u2013446.\nThere was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the\nrights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify the rights themselves.\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      15\n\n                          Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthis is not such a case.\nRule 23 Controls Class Certification\n  When the District Court in the case before us was asked\nto certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nsquarely governed the determination whether the court\nshould do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule\n23, therefore, must apply unless its application would\nabridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.\n  Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under\nstand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the\nquestion of class certification in this matter because New\nYork has made a substantive judgment that such a class\nshould not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.\nAlthough, as discussed infra, at 17\u201320, I do not accept the\ndissent\u2019s view of \u00a7901(b), I also do not see how the dis\nsent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent\u2019s premises that a class\n\ncannot be certified. The dissent contends that \u00a7901(b) is a damages\n\u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or \u201cproscription,\u201d post, at 12,\nn. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 \u201cdoes not command that a particular remedy\nbe available when a party sues in a representative capacity,\u201d post, at\n11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the\ndissent\u2019s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question\nwhether petitioner may certify a class, and \u00a7901(b) would be relevant\nonly to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action\nlawsuit, may collect statutory damages.\n   It may be that if the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7901(b) were correct,\nthis class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the\nfederal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(6). But that\nissue was not raised in respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss (from which the\ncase comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the\nCourt. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has \u201cacknowledged\nthat its individual claim\u201d is for less than the required amount in\ncontroversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what\nactual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court\nwere to adopt all of the dissent\u2019s premises, I believe the correct disposi\ntion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of\nwhether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.\n16     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                  Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that courts should \u201cavoi[d]\nimmoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that\nwould trench on state prerogatives,\u201d post, at 3\u20134, and\nshould in some instances \u201cinterpre[t] the federal rules to\navoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,\u201d\npost, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that is\nnot what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule\nshould be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not\nfollow that courts may rewrite the rule.\n   At bottom, the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 seems\nto be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its\napplication would create no Erie problem. The dissent\nwould apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie\neven to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,\nand thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But\n\u201c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,\nthe question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,\nrelatively unguided Erie choice.\u201d Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is\nsatisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro\ntect \u201cstate regulatory policies,\u201d post, at 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach would,\nin my view, work an end run around Congress\u2019 system of\nuniform federal rules, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, and our deci\nsion in Hanna. Federal courts can and should interpret\nfederal rules with sensitivity to \u201cstate prerogatives,\u201d post,\nat 4; but even when \u201cstate interests . . . warrant our re\nspectful consideration,\u201d post, at 8, federal courts cannot\nrewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly\nthat \u00a7901(b) is substantive and that class certification\nshould be denied, then they should argue within the Ena\nbling Act\u2019s framework. Otherwise, \u201cthe Federal Rule\napplies regardless of contrary state law.\u201d Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, n. 7; accord, Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nApplying Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act\n   As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a\nclass action such as this one, a federal court must inquire\nwhether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify New\nYork\u2019s rights or remedies, and thereby violate the Ena\nbling Act. This inquiry is not always a simple one because\n\u201c[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that\ncannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,\u201d\nWright \u00a74508, at 232\u2013233, and almost \u201cany rule can be\nsaid to have . . . \u2018substantive effects,\u2019 affecting society\u2019s\ndistribution of risks and rewards,\u201d Ely 724, n. 170. Faced\nwith a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition\nally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,\none can often argue that the state rule was really some\npart of the State\u2019s definition of its rights or remedies.\n   In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling\nAct problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law\nis designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a\njudgment about how state courts ought to operate and not\na judgment about the scope of state-created rights and\nremedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal\ncourt system, there are costs involved in attempting to\ndiscover the true nature of a state procedural rule and\nallowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule\nthat appears to govern the same question. The mere\npossibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created\nright is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.\n   The text of CPLR \u00a7901(b) expressly and unambiguously\napplies not only to claims based on New York law but also\nto claims based on federal law or the law of any other\nState. And there is no interpretation from New York\ncourts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how\n\u00a7901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce\ndural in form, serves the function of defining New York\u2019s\nrights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because\nlawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal\nclass actions well before New York passed \u00a7901(b) in 1975,\n18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is\ntrue, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited\namount of legislative history that can be read to suggest\nthat the New York officials who supported \u00a7901(b) wished\nto create a \u201climitation\u201d on New York\u2019s \u201cstatutory dam\nages.\u201d Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is\nnot the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7\u20138\n(opinion of the Court).\n   The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de\nscribe a judgment that \u00a7901(b) would operate as a limita\ntion on New York\u2019s statutory damages. In evaluating that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns\n\ncreate laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws\nwill apply only within their territory. See post, at 18\u201320. That is a true\nfact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent\u2019s position. For\none thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if\nthere is no conflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7901(b), and the court can thus\napply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the\nonly question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471.      And that inquiry is different from the Rules of\nDecision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469\u2013471.\n   The dissent\u2019s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter\npreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that\nlaws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending\nupon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume\nthat \u201cthe character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined\nwholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,\u201d American\nBanana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the\ncontext of \u00a7901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes\nlittle sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing\nwhat people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed\nto the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.\nThus, \u00a7901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it\nstates that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New\nYork Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear\nclaims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims\nunder New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had\nwritten a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up\n\u00a7901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong\npresumption is to the contrary.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlegislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between\nprocedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem\ningly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the\nscope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost\nevery rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect\non the outcome of litigation, not every state rule \u201cdefines\nthe dimensions of [a] claim itself,\u201d post, at 12. New York\nclearly crafted \u00a7901(b) with the intent that only certain\nlawsuits\u2014those for which there were not statutory penal\nties\u2014could be joined in class actions in New York courts.\nThat decision reflects a policy judgment about which\nlawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class\nform and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care\nfully outlines, see post, at 8\u201310, \u00a7901(b) was \u201capparently\u201d\nadopted in response to fears that the class-action proce\ndure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to \u201c annihi\nlating punishment of the defendant.\u201d V. Alexander, Prac\ntice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.\nCrompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,\n1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par\nticularly strong evidence that \u00a7901(b) serves to define who\ncan obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a\nclass would enlarge New York\u2019s remedy. Any device that\nmakes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to\nrecover damages.\n   In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some\nopponents of a broad class-action device \u201cargued that there\nwas no need to permit class actions in order to encourage\nlitigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an\naggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to\npursue a claim.\u201d Id., at 211, 863 N. E. 2d, at 1015 (em\nphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely\nthat, for any number of reasons, New York courts should\nnot conduct trials in the class format when that format is\n20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunnecessary to motivate litigation.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG\nasserts that this could not be true because \u201csuits seeking\nstatutory damages are arguably best suited to the class\ndevice because individual proof of actual damages is un\nnecessary.\u201d Post, at 9\u201310. But some people believe that\nclass actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as\nthey join together slightly disparate claims or force courts\nto adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss\nthe possibility that New York legislators shared in those\nbeliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when\nit appeared to be unnecessary.\n   The legislative history of \u00a7901 thus reveals a classically\nprocedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims\nin New York courts (under any source of law) only when it\nis necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the\nclass tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula\ntion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for\nbriefs. There is of course a difference of degree between\nthose examples and class certification, but not a difference\nof kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical\neffect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but\nthat does not transform it into a damages \u201cproscription,\u201d\npost, at 12, n. 6, 21, or \u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,\n25.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature\n\nwould create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply\nonly when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a\nlawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to\nsee how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York\u2019s\npenalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or\nindividual, and that \u00a7901(b) addresses penalties that are created under\nany source of state or federal law.\n   18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter\n\nwould \u201ctransform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.\u201d Post, at 1. But\nin fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one\n$5,000,000 case. It may be that without class certification, not all of\nthe potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

If the applicable federal rule did not\ngovern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly\nread not to do so), then those considerations would matter,\nfor precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See post, at\n17\u201324. But that is not this case. As the Court explained\nin Hanna, it is an \u201cincorrect assumption that the rule of\nErie R. Co. v. Thompkins constitutes the appropriate test\nof . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure.\u201d 380 U. S., at 469\u2013470. \u201cIt is true that both the\nEnabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal\ncourts are to apply state \u2018substantive\u2019 law and federal\n\u2018procedural\u2019 law,\u201d but the tests are different and reflect the\nfact that \u201cthey were designed to control very different\nsorts of decisions.\u201d Id., at 471.\n  Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only\ndecision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case\nwould \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify\u201d New York\u2019s substantive\nrights or remedies. \u00a72072(b). Although one can argue\nthat class certification would enlarge New York\u2019s \u201climited\u201d\ndamages remedy, see post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, such\narguments rest on extensive speculation about what the\nNew York Legislature had in mind when it created\n\u00a7901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing\nnarratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect\nthe plain textual reading of \u00a7901(b), a rule in New York\u2019s\nprocedural code about when to certify class actions\nbrought under any source of law, and respect Congress\u2019\ndecision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal\ncourts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be\nmore than just a possibility that the state rule is different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nprocedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located\n\ncourthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other fea\n\ntures of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue. \n\n22     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state\ncourt, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York\nIns. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over\ndue benefits would, by Shady Grove\u2019s own measure,\namount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal\ncourt based on the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship and request\ning class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for\nthe class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.\nThe New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in\nstructing that, unless specifically permitted, \u201can action to\nrecover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre\nated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a\nclass action.\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \u00a7901(b)\n(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures\nfor the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts\nthe application of \u00a7901(b) in diversity suits.\n  The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New\nYork\u2019s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.\n2        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Center for Humani\nties, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 427 (1996); see Erie R. Co. v.\nTompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Justice Harlan aptly\nconveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described Erie\nas \u201cone of the modern cornerstones of our federalism,\nexpressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of\njudicial power between the state and federal systems.\u201d\nHanna v.

S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.\n   The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal\ncourts from generating substantive law in diversity ac\ntions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as\npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a\npolicy of prime importance to our federal system. We have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, \u201c[t]he laws of the several\n\nstates, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or\nActs of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in\ncases where they apply.\u201d 28 U.

York, 326\nU. S. 99, 110 (1945).\n  The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,\nauthorizes us to \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and\nprocedure\u201d for the federal courts, but with a crucial re\nstriction: \u201cSuch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072. Pursuant to\nthis statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ\ning, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the\nlimits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard\nCorp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act\ncounsels against \u201cadventurous application\u201d of Rule 23; any\ntension with the Act \u201cis best kept within tolerable limits.\u201d);\nAmchem Products, Inc. v.

S. 497, 503\u2013504 (2001).\n  If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts\nwith state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with\nthe Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 469\u2013474. If, however, no Federal\nRule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision\nAct, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs\nfederal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when\nfailure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield\nmarkedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing\nthat the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act\nsimultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we\nhave endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within\nthe bounds of both congressional directives.\n                              B\n   In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men\ntioned in the Court\u2019s opinion, we have avoided immoderate\n4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Rule of Procedure encompasses a\nparticular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi\ncant disuniformity between state and federal courts\nshould be avoided if the text permits.\u201d).\n   In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the\nFederal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer\nv. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the\nCourt read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de\nfenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed\ndefenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in\nsuch cases, Palmer held, state law controls.\n   Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &\nWarehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that\nstate law determines when a diversity suit commences for\npurposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although\nFederal Rule 3 specified that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced\nby filing a complaint with the court,\u201d we held that the\nRule did not displace a state law that tied an action\u2019s\ncommencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531\u2013\n533. The \u201ccause of action [wa]s created by local law,\u201d the\nCourt explained, therefore \u201cthe measure of it [wa]s to be\nfound only in local law.\u201d Id., at 533.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Similarly in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,\n337 U. S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver\nsity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq\nuisite to pursuit of a stockholder\u2019s derivative action, to\npost a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga\ntion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff\u2019s insti\ntution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the\nFederal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder\u2019s\nmaintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no\nconflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques\ntion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court\nobserved. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for\ncosts requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors\ncould not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the\nfederal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction.\n   In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, \u201cthe\nscope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing\nparty urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule\nwhich covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the\nenforcement of state law.\u201d 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna\nitself, the Court found the clash \u201cunavoidable,\u201d ibid.; the\npetitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by\nFederal Rule 4(d)(1), but that \u201chow-to\u201d method did not\nsatisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service\non an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the\nMassachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce\ndure, however, \u201c[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .\nthat federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts\napplying them, and that the process of interpretation can\nand should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter\nests.\u201d R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,\nHart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal\nSystem 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).\n   Following Hanna, we continued to \u201cinterpre[t] the fed\neral rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory\npolicies.\u201d Hart & Wechsler 593.

CO.\n                 GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nup the question whether Ragan should be overruled; we\nheld, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly\nconflict with state rules governing the time when an ac\ntion commences for purposes of tolling a limitations pe\nriod. 446 U. S., at 749\u2013752. Rule 3, we said, addresses\nonly \u201cthe date from which various timing requirements of\nthe Federal Rules begin to run,\u201d id., at 751, and does not\n\u201cpurpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,\u201d id., at 750\u2013751.\nSignificant state policy interests would be frustrated, we\nobserved, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state\nrule, which required actual service on the defendant to\nstop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750\u2013\n752.\n   We were similarly attentive to a State\u2019s regulatory\npolicy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the\nstandard for determining when the large size of a jury\nverdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts\nalike had generally employed a \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test\nin reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,\nat 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule\n59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed\nthat a trial court could grant a new trial \u201cfor any of the\nreasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted\nin actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide\ngreater control, New York prescribed procedures under\nwhich jury verdicts would be examined to determine\nwhether they \u201cdeviate[d] materially from what would be\nreasonable compensation.\u201d See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n423\u2013425 (quoting CPLR \u00a75501(c)). This Court held that\nRule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of\nNew York\u2019s invigorated test.\n   Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim\npreclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a\ndiversity action on the basis of a California statute of\nlimitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

(Plaintiff chose Maryland because\nthat State\u2019s limitations period had not yet run.) We held\nthat Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun\ntary dismissal \u201coperate[d] as an adjudication on the mer\nits,\u201d did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in\nMaryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary\nland courts from entertaining the case, we said, \u201cwould\narguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules\nEnabling Act,\u201d 531 U. S., at 503, and \u201cwould in many cases\nviolate [Erie\u2019s] federalism principle,\u201d id., at 504.\n   In sum, both before and after Hanna, the above\ndescribed decisions show, federal courts have been cau\ntioned by this Court to \u201cinterpre[t] the Federal Rules . . .\nwith sensitivity to important state interests,\u201d Gasperini,\n518 U.

Yet\ntoday, the Court gives no quarter to New York\u2019s limitation\non statutory damages and requires the lower courts to\nthwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive\ndamages, New York\u2019s law controls the penalty to which a\ndefendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story\nbehind \u00a7901(b)\u2019s enactment deserves telling.\n   In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New\nYork proposed a new class-action statute designed \u201cto set\nup a flexible, functional scheme\u201d that would provide \u201can\neffective, but controlled group remedy.\u201d Judicial Confer\nence Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws\npp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the\nlegislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class\nactions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for\ncertification, eventually codified at \u00a7901(a), that closely\ntracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR \u00a7901(a) (requir\ning, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,\ntypicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).\n   While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New\nYork Legislature\u2019s hopper, \u201cvarious groups advocated for\nthe addition of a provision that would prohibit class action\nplaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmirror reality, as I later explain.

In this case,\nCPLR \u00a7901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,\nbut Allstate does not contend that \u00a7901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for\nRespondent 18 (\u201cThere is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica\ntion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground\nsquarely occupied by Rule 23.\u201d). Federal courts sitting in diversity have\nroutinely applied Rule 23\u2019s certification standards, rather than compa\nrable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\nExport Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18\u201324 (CA1 2008); Order and\nReasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.\nAction No. 05\u20134182 (ED La., Aug. 6, 2009).\n12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing\na claim for relief, while \u00a7901(b) defines the dimensions of\nthe claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that\n\u00a7901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than\nretail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have\nembedded the limitation in every provision creating a\ncause of action for which a penalty is authorized; \u00a7901(b)\noperates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a\npart of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be\nwere it included claim by claim in the New York Code.\n  The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit\n\u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d be maintained as a class action. See\nante, at 4\u20136. Putting the question that way, the Court\ndoes not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes\nclass treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be\ncause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and\nefficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section\n901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does\nnot allow class members to recover statutory damages\nbecause the New York Legislature considered the result of\nadjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The\nfair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti\nmate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of\nstate law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State\u2019s\nlawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The\nIrrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 722\n(1974) (It is relevant \u201cwhether the state provision embod\nies a substantive policy or represents only a procedural\ndisagreement with the federal rulemakers respecting the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court disputes the strength of the evidence of legislative intent,\n\nsee ante, at 9, but offers no alternative account of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s purpose.\nPerhaps this silence indicates how very hard it would be to ascribe to\n\u00a7901(b) any purpose bound up with the fairness and efficiency of\nprocessing cases. On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme\ndies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit.

The\nnotion that one directly impinges on Rule 23\u2019s domain,\nwhile the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the\noffice of Rule 23.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 There   is, of course, a difference between \u201cjustly administering [a]\nremedy,\u201d Sibbach v.

But the Court\u2019s relentless reading of Rule 23 today\ndoes exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of\nclass-size statutory damages even though the New York provision\ninstructs that such penalties shall not be available.\n  8 The Court states that \u201c[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect\n\nour perception of legislative purpose.\u201d Ante, at 9. But we can, of\ncourse, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State\u2019s regulatory policy\nto decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See\nsupra, at 3\u20137. Just as we read Federal Rule 3 in Walker v. Armco Steel\nCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 751 (1980), not to govern when a suit commences\n14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Plaintiffs seeking\nto vindicate claims for which the State has provided a\nstatutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action\nif they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual\ndamages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative\nclass member who objects can opt out and pursue actual\ndamages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an\nindividual action.

On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of\n\u00a7901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.\n  9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.\n\nIn discussing the remedial bar effected by \u00a7901(b), the bill\u2019s sponsor\nexplained that a \u201cstatutory class action for actual damages would still\nbe permissible.\u201d S.

On this understand\ning, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class\nwaives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v.

In sum,\nwhile phrased as responsive to the question whether\ncertain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b) is unmistakably\naimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that\nremedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.\n  Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves \u00a7901(b) in control of\nthe remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis\npelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which\ncounsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions\nagainst stretching a rule to cover every situation it could\nconceivably reach.10 The Court states that \u201c[t]here is no\nreason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether\nclaims made eligible for class treatment by some other law\nshould be certified as class actions.\u201d Ante, at 5. To the\ncontrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and\nSemtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates\nthe right to recover. See supra, at 4\u20137. That is plainly so\non a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there\nany reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief\nwhen the State that created the remedy disallows its\npursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our\nfederal system should give.\n  Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain\npenalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class\nrelief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for\ncertain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum\nrecovery. See, e.g., 15 U. S.

See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U. S., at 555; cf. Woods v. Inter\nstate Realty Co., 337 U.

Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.\nThey supply \u201csubstantive\u201d law in diversity suits, see York,\n326 U. S., at 109\u2013112, even though, as Shady Grove ac\nknowledges, state courts often apply the forum\u2019s limita\ntions period as a \u201cprocedural\u201d bar to claims arising under\nthe law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 16\u201317.

Similarly, federal courts\nsitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the\nburden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U.

See Restatement \u00a7133 and Re\nporter\u2019s Note.\n   In short, Shady Grove\u2019s effort to characterize \u00a7901(b) as\nsimply \u201cprocedural\u201d cannot successfully elide this funda\nmental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of\nan issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the\nsense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the\nRules of Decision Act commands application of the State\u2019s\nlaw in diversity suits. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 428;\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9; York, 326 U. S., at 109. As\nthis case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising\ndiversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award\nstatutory penalties in class actions while New York courts\nare bound by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s proscription, \u201csubstantial varia\ntions between state and federal [money judgments] may be\nexpected.\u201d Gasperini, 518 U.

By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a\nclass action, \u00a7901(b) controls a defendant\u2019s maximum\nliability in a suit seeking such a remedy. The remedial\nprovision could have been written as an explicit cap: \u201cIn\nany class action seeking statutory damages, relief is lim\nited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recov\nered in an individual suit.\u201d That New York\u2019s Legislature\nused other words to express the very same meaning\nshould be inconsequential.\n    We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing,\nin a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created\nremedies. See Woods, 337 U. S., at 538 (in a diversity\ncase, a plaintiff \u201cbarred from recovery in the state court\n. . . should likewise be barred in the federal court\u201d); York,\n326 U.

In\nCAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law\nbased class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,\nat least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in\ncontroversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress\nsought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness\nof some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 109\u201314, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers\nfrom \u201cgam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide\nor multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges\nhave reputations for readily certifying classes.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving \u201cthe \u2018I\nnever met a class action I didn\u2019t like\u2019 approach to class\ncertification\u201d that \u201cis prevalent in state courts in some\nlocalities\u201d). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer\u2014\nnot more\u2014class actions overall.
