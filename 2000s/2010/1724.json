P.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013586.      Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nPetitioners, shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent in\n  vestment adviser, filed this suit alleging that respondent violated\n  \u00a736(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes a\n  \u201cfiduciary duty [on investment advisers] with respect to the receipt of\n  compensation for services,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b). Granting respon\n  dent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petition\n  ers had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable stan\n  dard set forth in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.,\n  694 F. 2d 923, 928 (CA2): \u201c[T]he test is essentially whether the fee\n  schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have\n  been negotiated at arm\u2019s-length in light of all of the surrounding cir\n  cumstances. . . . To be guilty of a violation of \u00a736(b), . . . the adviser\n  must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no rea\n  sonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been\n  the product of arm\u2019s length bargaining.\u201d Rejecting the Gartenberg\n  standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different rea\n  soning.\nHeld: Based on \u00a736(b)\u2019s terms and the role that a shareholder action for\n breach of the investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty plays in the Act\u2019s\n overall structure, Gartenberg applied the correct standard. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) A consensus has developed regarding the standard Gartenberg\n set forth over 25 years ago: The standard has been adopted by other\n federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s regu\n lations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors. Both\n petitioners and respondents generally endorse the Gartenberg ap\n proach but disagree in some respects about its meaning. Pp. 7\u20139.\n    (b) Section 36(b)\u2019s \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d phrase finds its meaning in Pep\n per v. Linton, 308 U. S. 295, 306\u2013307, where the Court discussed the\n2                 JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: \u201cThe essence of the test\n    is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries\n    the earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain. If it does not, equity will\n    set it aside.\u201d Gartenberg\u2019s approach fully incorporates this under\n    standing, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into ac\n    count and using the range of fees that might result from arm\u2019s-length\n    bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees. Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the statu\n    tory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protec\n    tions the Act affords investors. Under the Act, scrutiny of investment\n    adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see\n    Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 482, and shareholder suits under\n    \u00a736(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for con\n    trolling adviser conflicts of interest, see Daily Income Fund, Inc. v.\n    Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 541. In recognition of the disinterested directors\u2019\n    role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser\u2019s\n    compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed appropriate under\n    all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). It may be inferred from this\n    formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment\n    may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate meas\n    ure of deference varies depending on the circumstances. Gartenberg\n    heeds these precepts. See 694 F. 2d, at 930. Pp. 11\u201312.\n       (d) The Court resolves the parties\u2019 disagreements on several impor\n    tant questions. First, since the Act requires consideration of all rele\n    vant factors, \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between\n    the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and\n    the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in\n    light of the similarities and differences between the services the cli\n    ents in question require. In doing so, the Court must be wary of in\n    apt comparisons based on significant differences between those ser\n    vices and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure\n    fee parity between the two types of clients. However, courts should\n    not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds\n    by other advisers, which may not result from arm\u2019s-length negotia\n    tions. Finally, a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment adviser\u2019s fiduci\n    ary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.\n    Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors,\n    their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to\n    considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differ\n    ently. Cf. Lasker, 441 U. S., at 486. In contrast, where the board\u2019s\n    process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information,\n    the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome. Id., at 484.\n    Gartenberg\u2019s \u201cso disproportionately large\u201d standard, 694 F. 2d, at\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

That standard may lack sharp analytical clarity, but it ac\n  curately reflects the compromise embodied in \u00a736(b) as to the appro\n  priate method of testing investment adviser compensation, and it has\n  provided a workable standard for nearly three decades.

JONES, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. HARRIS \n\n               ASSOCIATES L. P. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 30, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider in this case what a mutual fund share\nholder must prove in order to show that a mutual fund\ninvestment adviser breached the \u201cfiduciary duty with\nrespect to the receipt of compensation for services\u201d that is\nimposed by \u00a736(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (hereinafter \u00a736(b)).\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), 54 Stat.\n789, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u20131 et seq., regulates investment com\npanies, including mutual funds. \u201cA mutual fund is a pool\nof assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securi\nties, and belonging to the individual investors holding\nshares in the fund.\u201d Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 480\n(1979). The following arrangements are typical. A sepa\nrate entity called an investment adviser creates the mu\ntual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See\nKamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 93\n(1991); Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 536\n(1984); Burks, 441 U. S., at 480\u2013481. The adviser selects\n2            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe fund\u2019s directors, manages the fund\u2019s investments, and\nprovides other services. See id., at 481. Because of the\nrelationship between a mutual fund and its investment\nadviser, the fund often \u201c \u2018cannot, as a practical matter\nsever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the\nforces of arm\u2019s-length bargaining do not work in the mu\ntual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other\nsectors of the American economy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).\n   \u201cCongress adopted the [Investment Company Act of\n1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse\ninherent in the structure of investment companies.\u201d Daily\nIncome Fund, 464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a\nfund and its investment adviser was \u201cfraught with poten\ntial conflicts of interest,\u201d the Act created protections for\nmutual fund shareholders. Id., at 536\u2013538 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted); Burks, supra, at 482\u2013483. Among\nother things, the Act required that no more than 60 per\ncent of a fund\u2019s directors could be affiliated with the ad\nviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by\nthe directors and the shareholders of the fund. See \u00a7\u00a710,\n15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.\n   The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s\nprompted studies of the 1940 Act\u2019s effectiveness in protect\ning investors. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 537\u2013\n538. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identi\nfied problems relating to the independence of investment\ncompany boards and the compensation received by in\nvestment advisers. See ibid. In response to such con\ncerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered\nshareholder protection in two primary ways.\n   First, the amendments strengthened the \u201ccornerstone\u201d\nof the Act\u2019s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the inde\npendence of mutual fund boards of directors, which nego\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntiate and scrutinize adviser compensation. Burks, supra,\nat 482. The amendments required that no more than 60\npercent of a fund\u2019s directors be \u201cpersons who are inter\nested persons,\u201d e.g., that they have no interest in or affilia\ntion with the investment adviser.1 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u2013\n10(a); \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at\n538. These board members are given \u201ca host of special\nresponsibilities.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482\u2013483. In par\nticular, they must \u201creview and approve the contracts of the\ninvestment adviser\u201d annually, id., at 483, and a majority\nof these directors must approve an adviser\u2019s compensation,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c). Second, \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of\nthe Act imposed upon investment advisers a \u201cfiduciary\nduty\u201d with respect to compensation received from a mu\ntual fund, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b), and granted individual\ninvestors a private right of action for breach of that duty,\nibid.\n   The \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d standard contained in \u00a736(b) repre\nsented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the\n1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment\nadviser fees under state law were required to meet \u201ccom\nmon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an\nunreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An  \u201caffiliated person\u201d includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or\nholds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the in\nvestment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns,\ncontrols, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of\nthe securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, con\ntrolled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an\nofficer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment\nadviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment\nadviser\u2019s board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated\ninvestment adviser. See \u00a780a\u20132(a)(3). The Act defines \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath\nof people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested\npersons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the\ncompany, and interested broker-dealers. \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19).\n4            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt deemed it \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or \u2018shocking,\u2019 \u201d and \u201csecu\nrity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Invest\nment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross\nabuse of trust.\u201d Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 540,\nn. 12. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the\nSEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the\nCommission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was\nnot \u201creasonable\u201d and to intervene in any similar action\nbrought by or on behalf of an investment company. Id., at\n538. This approach was included in a bill that passed the\nHouse. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967); see\nalso S. 1659, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967). Industry\nrepresentatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing\nthat it \u201cmight in essence provide the Commission with\nratemaking authority.\u201d Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at\n538.\n   The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted \u201ca\ndifferent method of testing management compensation,\u201d\nid., at 539 (quoting S. Rep., at 5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)), that was more favorable to shareholders\nthan the previously available remedies but that did not\npermit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court\nfor \u201creasonableness.\u201d This is the fiduciary duty standard\nin \u00a736(b).\n                            B\n  Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual\nfunds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P., an\ninvestment adviser. Petitioners filed this action in the\nNorthern District of Illinois pursuant to \u00a736(b) seeking\ndamages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agree\nments between Harris Associates and the mutual funds.\nThe complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated\n\u00a736(b) by charging fees that were \u201cdisproportionate to the\nservices rendered\u201d and \u201cnot within the range of what\nwould have been negotiated at arm\u2019s length in light of all\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe surrounding circumstances.\u201d App. 52.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nHarris Associates. Applying the standard adopted in\nGartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694\nF. 2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners\nhad failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to \u201cwhether the\nfees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they\ncould not have been the result of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed\nthat it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with\nthose that Harris Associates charged its other clients. Id.,\nat 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as com\nparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to\nsimilar mutual funds, the Court held that it could not\nreasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside\nthe range that could have been the product of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining. Id., at 29a\u201332a.\n   A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on differ\nent reasoning, explicitly \u201cdisapprov[ing] the Gartenberg\napproach.\u201d 527 F. 3d 627, 632 (2008). Looking to trust\nlaw, the panel noted that, while a trustee \u201cowes an obliga\ntion of candor in negotiation,\u201d a trustee, at the time of the\ncreation of a trust, \u201cmay negotiate in his own interest and\naccept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to\npay.\u201d Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242,\nand Comment f)). The panel thus reasoned that \u201c[a] fidu\nciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must\nmake full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject\nto a cap on compensation.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632. In the\npanel\u2019s view, the amount of an adviser\u2019s compensation\nwould be relevant only if the compensation were \u201cso un\nusual\u201d as to give rise to an inference \u201cthat deceit must\nhave occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision\nhave abdicated.\u201d Ibid.\n   The panel argued that this understanding of \u00a736(b) is\nconsistent with the forces operating in the contemporary\n6               JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmutual fund market. Noting that \u201c[t]oday thousands of\nmutual funds compete,\u201d the panel concluded that \u201csophis\nticated investors\u201d shop for the funds that produce the best\noverall results, \u201cmov[e] their money elsewhere\u201d when fees\nare \u201cexcessive in relation to the results,\u201d and thus \u201ccreate\na competitive pressure\u201d that generally keeps fees low. Id.,\nat 633\u2013634. The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground\nthat it \u201crelies too little on markets.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632.\nAnd the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the\nfees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the\nfees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients,\nobserving that \u201c[d]ifferent clients call for different com\nmitments of time\u201d and that costs, such as research, that\nmay benefit several categories of clients \u201cmake it hard to\ndraw inferences from fee levels.\u201d Id., at 634.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an\nequally divided vote. 537 F. 3d 728 (2008). The dissent\nfrom the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\u2019s rejec\ntion of Gartenberg was based \u201cmainly on an economic\nanalysis that is ripe for reexamination.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 730\n(opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent\nexpressed concern that Harris Associates charged \u201cits\ncaptive funds more than twice what it charges independ\nent funds,\u201d and the dissent questioned whether high ad\nviser fees actually drive investors away. Id., at 731.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\nCourts of Appeals over the proper standard under \u00a736(b).2\n556 U.

The\nnumber of mutual fund investors grew from 3.5 million in\n1965 to 92 million in 2008, and there are now more than\n9,000 open- and closed-end funds.3\n  During this time, the standard for an investment ad\nviser\u2019s fiduciary duty has remained an open question in\nour Court, but, until the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision below,\nsomething of a consensus had developed regarding the\nstandard set forth over 25 years ago in Gartenberg, supra.\nThe Gartenberg standard has been adopted by other fed\neral courts,4 and \u201c[t]he SEC\u2019s regulations have recognized,\nand formalized, Gartenberg-like factors.\u201d Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 23.

As noted, the\nSeventh Circuit panel thought that the phrase \u201cfiduciary\nduty\u201d incorporates a standard taken from the law of\ntrusts. Petitioners agree but maintain that the panel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 A money market fund differs from a mutual fund in both the types\n\nof investments and the frequency of redemptions. A money market\nfund often invests in short-term money market securities, such as\nshort-term securities of the United States Government or its agencies,\nbank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Investors can\ninvest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor\u2019s\nperspective, the fund resembles an investment \u201cmore like a bank\naccount than [a] traditional investment in securities.\u201d Id., at 925.\n  7 Section 36 (b) provides as follows:\n\n  \u201c[T]he investment adviser of a registered investment company shall\nbe deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of com\npensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by\nsuch registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof,\nto such investment adviser.\u201d 84 Stat. 1429 (codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a780a\u201335(b)).\n10           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nidentified the wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the\nstandard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negoti\nate the trustee\u2019s fee at the time of the creation of a trust,\npetitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trus\ntee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for\nPetitioners 20\u201323, 35\u201337. A compensation agreement\nreached at that time, they point out, \u201c \u2018will not bind the\nbeneficiary\u2019 if either \u2018the trustee failed to make a full\ndisclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement\u2019 \u201d\nwhich he knew or should have known or if the agreement\nis unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restate\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242, Comment i). Respondent,\non the other hand, contends that the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d is\nnot exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means\ndifferent things in different contexts, and that there is no\nreason to believe that \u00a736(b) incorporates the specific\nmeaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Re\nspondent 34\u201336.\n   We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In\nPepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), we discussed the\nmeaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that\nis analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to\ntrust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could disallow a dominant or controlling share\nholder\u2019s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corpo\nration. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are\n\u201cfiduciar[ies]\u201d whose \u201cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\u201d\nId., at 306. We then explained:\n     \u201cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected to\n     rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or\n     engagements with the corporation is challenged the\n     burden is on the director or stockholder not only to\n     prove the good faith of the transaction but also to\n     show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the\n     corporation and those interested therein. . . .

If it does not, equity will set it\n    aside.\u201d Id., at 306\u2013307 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted); see also Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining\n    Co., 254 U. S. 590, 599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary\n    duty for interested directors).\nWe believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of\nthe phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d in \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The\nInvestment Company Act modifies this duty in a signifi\ncant way: it shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to\nthe party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1), to\nshow that the fee is outside the range that arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining would produce.\n   The Gartenberg approach fully incorporates this under\nstanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in Pepper and\nreflects \u00a736(b)(1)\u2019s imposition of the burden on the plain\ntiff. As noted, Gartenberg insists that all relevant circum\nstances be taken into account, see 694 F. 2d, at 929, as\ndoes \u00a736(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\u201c[A]pproval by the board of\ndirectors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court\nas is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances \u201d\n(emphasis added)). And Gartenberg uses the range of fees\nthat might result from arm\u2019s-length bargaining as the\nbenchmark for reviewing challenged fees.\n                              2\n  Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the\nstatutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the\nother protections that the Act affords investors.\n  Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compen\nsation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the \u201ccor\nnerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest\nwithin mutual funds.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482. The Act\ninterposes disinterested directors as \u201cindependent watch\ndogs\u201d of the relationship between a mutual fund and its\n12           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadviser. Id., at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo provide these directors with the information needed to\njudge whether an adviser\u2019s compensation is excessive, the\nAct requires advisers to furnish all information \u201creasona\nbly . . . necessary to evaluate the terms\u201d of the adviser\u2019s\ncontract, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c), and gives the SEC the\nauthority to enforce that requirement. See \u00a780a\u201341.\nBoard scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder\nsuits under \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing\nbut independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts. See\nDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 541 (Congress intended\nfor \u00a736(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser con\ntracts to act as \u201cindependent checks on excessive fees\u201d);\nKamen, 500 U. S., at 108 (\u201cCongress added \u00a736(b) to the\n[Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders\nshould not have to rely solely on the fund\u2019s directors to\nassure reasonable adviser fees, notwithstanding the in\ncreased disinterestedness of the board\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n  In recognition of the role of the disinterested directors,\nthe Act instructs courts to give board approval of an ad\nviser\u2019s compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed\nappropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2).\nCf. Burks, 441 U. S., at 485 (\u201c[I]t would have been para\ndoxical for Congress to have been willing to rely largely\nupon [boards of directors as] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect share\nholder interests and yet, where the \u2018watchdogs\u2019 have done\nprecisely that, require that they be totally muzzled\u201d).\n  From this formulation, two inferences may be drawn.\nFirst, a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment may\nbe appropriate in some instances. Second, the appro\npriate measure of deference varies depending on the\ncircumstances.\n  Gartenberg heeds these precepts. Gartenberg advises\nthat \u201cthe expertise of the independent trustees of a fund,\nwhether they are fully informed about all facts bearing on\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

As noted, the Gartenberg\ncourt rejected a comparison between the fees that the\nadviser in that case charged a money market fund and the\nfees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3\n(noting the \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the services re\nquired by each type of fund differ sharply\u201d). Petitioners\ncontend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for\nPetitioners 30\u201331, but respondent disagrees. Brief for\nRespondent 38\u201344. Since the Act requires consideration of\nall relevant factors, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2); see also\n\u00a780a\u201315(c), we do not think that there can be any cate\ngorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged\ndifferent types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra,\nat 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers\u2019\npractice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to\ntheir other clients). Instead, courts may give such com\nparisons the weight that they merit in light of the simi\nlarities and differences between the services that the\nclients in question require, but courts must be wary of\ninapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may\nbe significant differences between the services provided by\nan investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it pro\nvides to a pension fund which are attributable to the\n14              JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual\nfund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more\nburdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher\nmarketing costs. 527 F. 3d, at 634 (\u201cDifferent clients call\nfor different commitments of time\u201d). If the services ren\ndered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not\nprobative, then courts must reject such a comparison.\nEven if the services provided and fees charged to an inde\npendent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that\nthe Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between\nmutual funds and institutional clients contrary to peti\ntioners\u2019 contentions. See id., at 631. (\u201cPlaintiffs maintain\nthat a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more\nthan its independent clients\u201d).8\n   By the same token, courts should not rely too heavily on\ncomparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other\nadvisers. These comparisons are problematic because\nthese fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of\nnegotiations conducted at arm\u2019s length. See 537 F. 3d, at\n731\u2013732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc); Gartenberg, supra, at 929 (\u201cCompetition between\nmoney market funds for shareholder business does not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Comparisons with fees charged to institutional clients, therefore,\n\nwill not \u201cdoo[m] [a]ny [f]und to [t]rial.\u201d Brief for Respondent 49; see\nalso Strougo v. BEA Assocs., 188 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (SDNY 2002)\n(suggesting that fee comparisons, where permitted, might produce a\ntriable issue). First, plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that fees are\nbeyond the range of arm\u2019s-length bargaining. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). Second, a\nshowing of relevance requires courts to assess any disparity in fees in\nlight of the different markets for advisory services. Only where plain\ntiffs have shown a large disparity in fees that cannot be explained by\nthe different services in addition to other evidence that the fee is\noutside the arm\u2019s-length range will trial be appropriate.

See 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2) (requiring defer\nence to board\u2019s consideration \u201cas is deemed appropriate\nunder all the circumstances\u201d); cf. Daily Income Fund, 464\nU. S., at 541 (\u201cCongress intended security holder and SEC\nactions under \u00a736(b), on the one hand, and directorial\napproval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as inde\npendent checks on excessive fees\u201d). Where a board\u2019s proc\ness for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser\ncompensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford\ncommensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining\nprocess. See Burks, 441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated direc\ntors serve as \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d). Thus, if the\ndisinterested directors considered the relevant factors,\ntheir decision to approve a particular fee agreement is\nentitled to considerable weight, even if a court might\nweigh the factors differently. Cf. id., at 485. This is not to\ndeny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated\nby a board in possession of all relevant information, but\nsuch a determination must be based on evidence that the\nfee \u201cis so disproportionately large that it bears no reason\nable relationship to the services rendered and could not\nhave been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d Gar\ntenberg, supra, at 928.\n   In contrast, where the board\u2019s process was deficient or\nthe adviser withheld important information, the court\nmust take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an\ninvestment adviser fails to disclose material information\nto the board, greater scrutiny is justified because the\nwithheld information might have hampered the board\u2019s\nability to function as \u201can independent check upon the\n16           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanagement.\u201d Burks, supra, at 484 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cSection 36(b) is sharply focused on the\nquestion of whether the fees themselves were excessive.\u201d\nMigdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc., 248 F. 3d 321,\n328 (CA4 2001); see also 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (imposing\na \u201cfiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensa\ntion for services, or of payments of a material nature\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But an adviser\u2019s compliance or non\ncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that\nmust be considered in calibrating the degree of deference\nthat is due a board\u2019s decision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees.\n   It is also important to note that the standard for fiduci\nary breach under \u00a736(b) does not call for judicial second\nguessing of informed board decisions. See Daily Income\nFund, supra, at 538; see also Burks, 441 U. S., at 483\n(\u201cCongress consciously chose to address the conflict-of\ninterest problem through the Act\u2019s independent-directors\nsection, rather than through more drastic remedies\u201d).\n\u201c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some re\nstraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinter\nested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transac\ntions with the investment adviser,\u201d but they do not\nsuggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disin\nterested directors apprised of all relevant information,\nwithout additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm\u2019s\nlength range. Id., at 481. In reviewing compensation\nunder \u00a736(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in\na precise calculation of fees representative of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining. See 527 F. 3d, at 633 (\u201cJudicial price-setting\ndoes not accompany fiduciary duties\u201d). As recounted\nabove, Congress rejected a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement\nthat was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting\nresponsibilities. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538\u2013\n540. Congress\u2019 approach recognizes that courts are not\nwell suited to make such precise calculations. Cf. General\nMotors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.

S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b), that courts have applied\nsince (and in certain respects in spite of) Gartenberg v.\nMerrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F. 2d 923, 928\u2013\n930 (CA2 1982). I write separately because I would not\nshortchange the Court\u2019s effort by describing it as affirma\ntion of the \u201cGartenberg standard.\u201d Ante, at 7, 17.\n   The District Court and Court of Appeals in Gartenberg\ncreated that standard, which emphasizes fee \u201cfairness\u201d\nand proportionality, 694 F. 2d, at 929, in a manner that\ncould be read to permit the equivalent of the judicial rate\nregulation the Gartenberg opinions disclaim, based on the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940\u2019s \u201ctortuous\u201d legislative\nhistory and a handful of extrastatutory policy and market\nconsiderations, id., at 928; see also id., at 926\u2013927, 929\u2013\n931; Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.,\n528 F. Supp. 1038, 1046\u20131050, 1055\u20131057 (SDNY 1981).\nAlthough virtually all subsequent \u00a736(b) cases cite Gar\ntenberg, most courts have correctly declined its invitation\nto stray beyond statutory bounds. Instead, they have\nfollowed an approach (principally in deciding which cases\nmay proceed past summary judgment) that defers to the\ninformed conclusions of disinterested boards and holds\nplaintiffs to their heavy burden of proof in the manner the\n2            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nAct, and now the Court\u2019s opinion, requires. See, e.g., ante,\nat 11 (underscoring that the Act \u201cmodifies\u201d the governing\nfiduciary duty standard \u201cin a significant way: It shifts the\nburden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming\nbreach, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1), to show that the fee is\noutside the range that arm\u2019s-length bargaining would\nproduce\u201d); ante, at 16 (citing the \u201cdegree of deference that\nis due a board\u2019s decision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees\u201d and\nadmonishing that \u201cthe standard for fiduciary breach under\n\u00a736(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of in\nformed board decisions\u201d).\n   I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to affirm this approach\nbased upon the Investment Company Act\u2019s text and our\nlongstanding fiduciary duty precedents. But I would not\nsay that in doing so we endorse the \u201cGartenberg standard.\u201d\nWhatever else might be said about today\u2019s decision, it does\nnot countenance the free-ranging judicial \u201cfairness\u201d review\nof fees that Gartenberg could be read to authorize, see 694\nF. 2d, at 929\u2013930, and that virtually all courts deciding\n\u00a736(b) cases since Gartenberg (including the Court of\nAppeals in this case) have wisely eschewed in the post\nGartenberg precedents we approve.\n",

Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nPetitioners, shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent in\n  vestment adviser, filed this suit alleging that respondent violated\n  \u00a736(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes a\n  \u201cfiduciary duty [on investment advisers] with respect to the receipt of\n  compensation for services,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b). Granting respon\n  dent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petition\n  ers had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable stan\n  dard set forth in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.,\n  694 F. 2d 923, 928 (CA2): \u201c[T]he test is essentially whether the fee\n  schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have\n  been negotiated at arm\u2019s-length in light of all of the surrounding cir\n  cumstances. . . . To be guilty of a violation of \u00a736(b), . . . the adviser\n  must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no rea\n  sonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been\n  the product of arm\u2019s length bargaining.\u201d Rejecting the Gartenberg\n  standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different rea\n  soning.\nHeld: Based on \u00a736(b)\u2019s terms and the role that a shareholder action for\n breach of the investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty plays in the Act\u2019s\n overall structure, Gartenberg applied the correct standard. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) A consensus has developed regarding the standard Gartenberg\n set forth over 25 years ago: The standard has been adopted by other\n federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s regu\n lations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors. Both\n petitioners and respondents generally endorse the Gartenberg ap\n proach but disagree in some respects about its meaning. Pp. 7\u20139.\n    (b) Section 36(b)\u2019s \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d phrase finds its meaning in Pep\n per v. Linton, 308 U. S. 295, 306\u2013307, where the Court discussed the\n2                 JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: \u201cThe essence of the test\n    is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries\n    the earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain. If it does not, equity will\n    set it aside.\u201d Gartenberg\u2019s approach fully incorporates this under\n    standing, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into ac\n    count and using the range of fees that might result from arm\u2019s-length\n    bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees. Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the statu\n    tory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protec\n    tions the Act affords investors. Under the Act, scrutiny of investment\n    adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see\n    Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 482, and shareholder suits under\n    \u00a736(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for con\n    trolling adviser conflicts of interest, see Daily Income Fund, Inc. v.\n    Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 541. In recognition of the disinterested directors\u2019\n    role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser\u2019s\n    compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed appropriate under\n    all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). It may be inferred from this\n    formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment\n    may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate meas\n    ure of deference varies depending on the circumstances. Gartenberg\n    heeds these precepts. See 694 F. 2d, at 930. Pp. 11\u201312.\n       (d) The Court resolves the parties\u2019 disagreements on several impor\n    tant questions. First, since the Act requires consideration of all rele\n    vant factors, \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between\n    the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and\n    the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in\n    light of the similarities and differences between the services the cli\n    ents in question require. In doing so, the Court must be wary of in\n    apt comparisons based on significant differences between those ser\n    vices and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure\n    fee parity between the two types of clients. However, courts should\n    not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds\n    by other advisers, which may not result from arm\u2019s-length negotia\n    tions. Finally, a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment adviser\u2019s fiduci\n    ary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.\n    Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors,\n    their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to\n    considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differ\n    ently. Cf. Lasker, 441 U. S., at 486. In contrast, where the board\u2019s\n    process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information,\n    the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome.

S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (hereinafter \u00a736(b)).\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), 54 Stat.\n789, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u20131 et seq., regulates investment com\npanies, including mutual funds. \u201cA mutual fund is a pool\nof assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securi\nties, and belonging to the individual investors holding\nshares in the fund.\u201d Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 480\n(1979). The following arrangements are typical. A sepa\nrate entity called an investment adviser creates the mu\ntual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See\nKamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 93\n(1991); Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 536\n(1984); Burks, 441 U. S., at 480\u2013481.

Because of the\nrelationship between a mutual fund and its investment\nadviser, the fund often \u201c \u2018cannot, as a practical matter\nsever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the\nforces of arm\u2019s-length bargaining do not work in the mu\ntual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other\nsectors of the American economy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).\n   \u201cCongress adopted the [Investment Company Act of\n1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse\ninherent in the structure of investment companies.\u201d Daily\nIncome Fund, 464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a\nfund and its investment adviser was \u201cfraught with poten\ntial conflicts of interest,\u201d the Act created protections for\nmutual fund shareholders. Id., at 536\u2013538 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted); Burks, supra, at 482\u2013483. Among\nother things, the Act required that no more than 60 per\ncent of a fund\u2019s directors could be affiliated with the ad\nviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by\nthe directors and the shareholders of the fund. See \u00a7\u00a710,\n15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.\n   The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s\nprompted studies of the 1940 Act\u2019s effectiveness in protect\ning investors. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 537\u2013\n538. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identi\nfied problems relating to the independence of investment\ncompany boards and the compensation received by in\nvestment advisers. See ibid. In response to such con\ncerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered\nshareholder protection in two primary ways.\n   First, the amendments strengthened the \u201ccornerstone\u201d\nof the Act\u2019s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the inde\npendence of mutual fund boards of directors, which nego\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The amendments required that no more than 60\npercent of a fund\u2019s directors be \u201cpersons who are inter\nested persons,\u201d e.g., that they have no interest in or affilia\ntion with the investment adviser.1 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u2013\n10(a); \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at\n538. These board members are given \u201ca host of special\nresponsibilities.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482\u2013483. In par\nticular, they must \u201creview and approve the contracts of the\ninvestment adviser\u201d annually, id., at 483, and a majority\nof these directors must approve an adviser\u2019s compensation,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c). Second, \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of\nthe Act imposed upon investment advisers a \u201cfiduciary\nduty\u201d with respect to compensation received from a mu\ntual fund, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b), and granted individual\ninvestors a private right of action for breach of that duty,\nibid.\n   The \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d standard contained in \u00a736(b) repre\nsented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the\n1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment\nadviser fees under state law were required to meet \u201ccom\nmon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an\nunreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An  \u201caffiliated person\u201d includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or\nholds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the in\nvestment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns,\ncontrols, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of\nthe securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, con\ntrolled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an\nofficer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment\nadviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment\nadviser\u2019s board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated\ninvestment adviser. See \u00a780a\u20132(a)(3). The Act defines \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath\nof people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested\npersons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the\ncompany, and interested broker-dealers. \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19).\n4            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt deemed it \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or \u2018shocking,\u2019 \u201d and \u201csecu\nrity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Invest\nment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross\nabuse of trust.\u201d Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 540,\nn. 12. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the\nSEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the\nCommission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was\nnot \u201creasonable\u201d and to intervene in any similar action\nbrought by or on behalf of an investment company. Id., at\n538. This approach was included in a bill that passed the\nHouse. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967); see\nalso S. 1659, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967).

Applying the standard adopted in\nGartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694\nF. 2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners\nhad failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to \u201cwhether the\nfees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they\ncould not have been the result of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed\nthat it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with\nthose that Harris Associates charged its other clients. Id.,\nat 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as com\nparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to\nsimilar mutual funds, the Court held that it could not\nreasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside\nthe range that could have been the product of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining.

Looking to trust\nlaw, the panel noted that, while a trustee \u201cowes an obliga\ntion of candor in negotiation,\u201d a trustee, at the time of the\ncreation of a trust, \u201cmay negotiate in his own interest and\naccept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to\npay.\u201d Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242,\nand Comment f)). The panel thus reasoned that \u201c[a] fidu\nciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must\nmake full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject\nto a cap on compensation.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632. In the\npanel\u2019s view, the amount of an adviser\u2019s compensation\nwould be relevant only if the compensation were \u201cso un\nusual\u201d as to give rise to an inference \u201cthat deceit must\nhave occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision\nhave abdicated.\u201d Ibid.\n   The panel argued that this understanding of \u00a736(b) is\nconsistent with the forces operating in the contemporary\n6               JONES v.

Noting that \u201c[t]oday thousands of\nmutual funds compete,\u201d the panel concluded that \u201csophis\nticated investors\u201d shop for the funds that produce the best\noverall results, \u201cmov[e] their money elsewhere\u201d when fees\nare \u201cexcessive in relation to the results,\u201d and thus \u201ccreate\na competitive pressure\u201d that generally keeps fees low.

The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground\nthat it \u201crelies too little on markets.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632.\nAnd the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the\nfees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the\nfees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients,\nobserving that \u201c[d]ifferent clients call for different com\nmitments of time\u201d and that costs, such as research, that\nmay benefit several categories of clients \u201cmake it hard to\ndraw inferences from fee levels.\u201d Id., at 634.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an\nequally divided vote. 537 F. 3d 728 (2008). The dissent\nfrom the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\u2019s rejec\ntion of Gartenberg was based \u201cmainly on an economic\nanalysis that is ripe for reexamination.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 730\n(opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent\nexpressed concern that Harris Associates charged \u201cits\ncaptive funds more than twice what it charges independ\nent funds,\u201d and the dissent questioned whether high ad\nviser fees actually drive investors away.

A money market\nfund often invests in short-term money market securities, such as\nshort-term securities of the United States Government or its agencies,\nbank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Investors can\ninvest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor\u2019s\nperspective, the fund resembles an investment \u201cmore like a bank\naccount than [a] traditional investment in securities.\u201d Id., at 925.\n  7 Section 36 (b) provides as follows:\n\n  \u201c[T]he investment adviser of a registered investment company shall\nbe deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of com\npensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by\nsuch registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof,\nto such investment adviser.\u201d 84 Stat. 1429 (codified at 15 U.

Instead of the\nstandard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negoti\nate the trustee\u2019s fee at the time of the creation of a trust,\npetitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trus\ntee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for\nPetitioners 20\u201323, 35\u201337. A compensation agreement\nreached at that time, they point out, \u201c \u2018will not bind the\nbeneficiary\u2019 if either \u2018the trustee failed to make a full\ndisclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement\u2019 \u201d\nwhich he knew or should have known or if the agreement\nis unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restate\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242, Comment i). Respondent,\non the other hand, contends that the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d is\nnot exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means\ndifferent things in different contexts, and that there is no\nreason to believe that \u00a736(b) incorporates the specific\nmeaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Re\nspondent 34\u201336.\n   We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In\nPepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), we discussed the\nmeaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that\nis analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to\ntrust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could disallow a dominant or controlling share\nholder\u2019s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corpo\nration. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are\n\u201cfiduciar[ies]\u201d whose \u201cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\u201d\nId., at 306. We then explained:\n     \u201cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected to\n     rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or\n     engagements with the corporation is challenged the\n     burden is on the director or stockholder not only to\n     prove the good faith of the transaction but also to\n     show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the\n     corporation and those interested therein. . . .

If it does not, equity will set it\n    aside.\u201d Id., at 306\u2013307 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted); see also Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining\n    Co., 254 U. S. 590, 599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary\n    duty for interested directors).\nWe believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of\nthe phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d in \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The\nInvestment Company Act modifies this duty in a signifi\ncant way: it shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to\nthe party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1), to\nshow that the fee is outside the range that arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining would produce.\n   The Gartenberg approach fully incorporates this under\nstanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in Pepper and\nreflects \u00a736(b)(1)\u2019s imposition of the burden on the plain\ntiff. As noted, Gartenberg insists that all relevant circum\nstances be taken into account, see 694 F. 2d, at 929, as\ndoes \u00a736(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\u201c[A]pproval by the board of\ndirectors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court\nas is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances \u201d\n(emphasis added)). And Gartenberg uses the range of fees\nthat might result from arm\u2019s-length bargaining as the\nbenchmark for reviewing challenged fees.\n                              2\n  Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the\nstatutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the\nother protections that the Act affords investors.\n  Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compen\nsation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the \u201ccor\nnerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest\nwithin mutual funds.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482. The Act\ninterposes disinterested directors as \u201cindependent watch\ndogs\u201d of the relationship between a mutual fund and its\n12           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadviser. Id., at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo provide these directors with the information needed to\njudge whether an adviser\u2019s compensation is excessive, the\nAct requires advisers to furnish all information \u201creasona\nbly . . . necessary to evaluate the terms\u201d of the adviser\u2019s\ncontract, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c), and gives the SEC the\nauthority to enforce that requirement. See \u00a780a\u201341.\nBoard scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder\nsuits under \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing\nbut independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts. See\nDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 541 (Congress intended\nfor \u00a736(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser con\ntracts to act as \u201cindependent checks on excessive fees\u201d);\nKamen, 500 U. S., at 108 (\u201cCongress added \u00a736(b) to the\n[Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders\nshould not have to rely solely on the fund\u2019s directors to\nassure reasonable adviser fees, notwithstanding the in\ncreased disinterestedness of the board\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n  In recognition of the role of the disinterested directors,\nthe Act instructs courts to give board approval of an ad\nviser\u2019s compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed\nappropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2).\nCf.

Second, the appro\npriate measure of deference varies depending on the\ncircumstances.\n  Gartenberg heeds these precepts.

As noted, the Gartenberg\ncourt rejected a comparison between the fees that the\nadviser in that case charged a money market fund and the\nfees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3\n(noting the \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the services re\nquired by each type of fund differ sharply\u201d). Petitioners\ncontend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for\nPetitioners 30\u201331, but respondent disagrees. Brief for\nRespondent 38\u201344. Since the Act requires consideration of\nall relevant factors, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2); see also\n\u00a780a\u201315(c), we do not think that there can be any cate\ngorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged\ndifferent types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra,\nat 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers\u2019\npractice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to\ntheir other clients). Instead, courts may give such com\nparisons the weight that they merit in light of the simi\nlarities and differences between the services that the\nclients in question require, but courts must be wary of\ninapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may\nbe significant differences between the services provided by\nan investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it pro\nvides to a pension fund which are attributable to the\n14              JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual\nfund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more\nburdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher\nmarketing costs. 527 F. 3d, at 634 (\u201cDifferent clients call\nfor different commitments of time\u201d). If the services ren\ndered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not\nprobative, then courts must reject such a comparison.\nEven if the services provided and fees charged to an inde\npendent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that\nthe Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between\nmutual funds and institutional clients contrary to peti\ntioners\u2019 contentions. See id., at 631. (\u201cPlaintiffs maintain\nthat a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more\nthan its independent clients\u201d).8\n   By the same token, courts should not rely too heavily on\ncomparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other\nadvisers. These comparisons are problematic because\nthese fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of\nnegotiations conducted at arm\u2019s length.

First, plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that fees are\nbeyond the range of arm\u2019s-length bargaining. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). Second, a\nshowing of relevance requires courts to assess any disparity in fees in\nlight of the different markets for advisory services. Only where plain\ntiffs have shown a large disparity in fees that cannot be explained by\nthe different services in addition to other evidence that the fee is\noutside the arm\u2019s-length range will trial be appropriate.

See 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2) (requiring defer\nence to board\u2019s consideration \u201cas is deemed appropriate\nunder all the circumstances\u201d); cf. Daily Income Fund, 464\nU. S., at 541 (\u201cCongress intended security holder and SEC\nactions under \u00a736(b), on the one hand, and directorial\napproval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as inde\npendent checks on excessive fees\u201d). Where a board\u2019s proc\ness for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser\ncompensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford\ncommensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining\nprocess. See Burks, 441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated direc\ntors serve as \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d). Thus, if the\ndisinterested directors considered the relevant factors,\ntheir decision to approve a particular fee agreement is\nentitled to considerable weight, even if a court might\nweigh the factors differently. Cf. id., at 485. This is not to\ndeny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated\nby a board in possession of all relevant information, but\nsuch a determination must be based on evidence that the\nfee \u201cis so disproportionately large that it bears no reason\nable relationship to the services rendered and could not\nhave been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d Gar\ntenberg, supra, at 928.\n   In contrast, where the board\u2019s process was deficient or\nthe adviser withheld important information, the court\nmust take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an\ninvestment adviser fails to disclose material information\nto the board, greater scrutiny is justified because the\nwithheld information might have hampered the board\u2019s\nability to function as \u201can independent check upon the\n16           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanagement.\u201d Burks, supra, at 484 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cSection 36(b) is sharply focused on the\nquestion of whether the fees themselves were excessive.\u201d\nMigdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc., 248 F. 3d 321,\n328 (CA4 2001); see also 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (imposing\na \u201cfiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensa\ntion for services, or of payments of a material nature\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But an adviser\u2019s compliance or non\ncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that\nmust be considered in calibrating the degree of deference\nthat is due a board\u2019s decision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees.\n   It is also important to note that the standard for fiduci\nary breach under \u00a736(b) does not call for judicial second\nguessing of informed board decisions. See Daily Income\nFund, supra, at 538; see also Burks, 441 U. S., at 483\n(\u201cCongress consciously chose to address the conflict-of\ninterest problem through the Act\u2019s independent-directors\nsection, rather than through more drastic remedies\u201d).\n\u201c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some re\nstraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinter\nested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transac\ntions with the investment adviser,\u201d but they do not\nsuggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disin\nterested directors apprised of all relevant information,\nwithout additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm\u2019s\nlength range. Id., at 481. In reviewing compensation\nunder \u00a736(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in\na precise calculation of fees representative of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining. See 527 F. 3d, at 633 (\u201cJudicial price-setting\ndoes not accompany fiduciary duties\u201d). As recounted\nabove, Congress rejected a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement\nthat was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting\nresponsibilities. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538\u2013\n540. Congress\u2019 approach recognizes that courts are not\nwell suited to make such precise calculations. Cf. General\nMotors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.

The\nGartenberg standard, which the panel rejected, may lack\nsharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately\nreflects the compromise that is embodied in \u00a736(b), and it\nhas provided a workable standard for nearly three dec\nades. The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel and\nthe dissent from the denial of rehearing regarding today\u2019s\nmutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the\ncourts.\n                            IV\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is vacated, and the case remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.
