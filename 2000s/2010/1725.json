SMITH\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u20131402. Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nCriminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an im\n  partial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. See\n  Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522. To establish a prima facie viola\n  tion of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove\n  that: (1) a group qualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and rea\n  sonably represented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d in\n  the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.\n  Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.\n     At voir dire in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent\n  Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60\n  and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.\n  At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the County\u2019s\n  jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential ju\n  rors were drawn. The court rejected Smith\u2019s objection to the panel\u2019s\n  racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree\n  murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him\n  to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n     On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court con\n  ducted an evidentiary hearing on Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n  The evidence at the hearing showed, inter alia, that under the juror\n  assignment order in effect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled, the\n  County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and,\n  only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the\n  countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\n  Smith calls this procedure \u201csiphoning.\u201d The month after Smith\u2019s voir\n  dire, however, the County reversed course and adopted a Circuit-\n  Court-first assignment order. It did so based on the belief that the\n  district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit\n2                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County. The\n    trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of\n    African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. First, the court de\n    scribed the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d test, under which the percentage of\n    African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the per\n    centage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). According to this measure, African-Americans were under\n    represented by 1.28%. Next, the court set out the \u201ccomparative dis\n    parity\u201d test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by\n    the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, African-\n    Americans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury\n    eligible population, to be on the jury-service list. In the 11 months\n    after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment\n    policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to\n    15.1%. The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans\n    were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires. But Smith\u2019s evi\n    dence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror\n    assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had\n    systematically excluded African-Americans. The court therefore re\n    jected Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n       The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new\n    trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\n    order. Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded\n    that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment vio\n    lation. This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no\n    preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinc\n    tive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable. The court noted\n    that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and\n    comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test. Adopting\n    a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of\n    measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had\n    failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measure\n    ment. Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on under\n    representation, the court determined that he had not shown system\n    atic exclusion.\n       Smith then filed a federal habeas petition. The Antiterrorism and\n    Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal ha\n    beas relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision\n    that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n    clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n    of the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a deci\n    sion that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n    light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a72254(d)(2). Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\n  decision when assessed under AEDPA\u2019s standards, the District Court\n  dismissed Smith\u2019s petition. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Court of\n  Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity\n  test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly ex\n  cluded group is small. The court then held that Smith\u2019s comparative\n  disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans\u2019 represen\n  tation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.\n  It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion. In accord\n  with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit be\n  lieved that the district-court-first assignment order significantly re\n  duced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court\n  venires. Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, be\n  cause no important state interest supported the district-court-first al\n  location system.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme\n Court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly\n established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). Duren hardly establishes\u2014no\n less \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right\n to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the commu\n nity. Pp. 10\u201316.\n    (a) The Duren defendant readily met all three parts of the Court\u2019s\n prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a\n county\u2019s jury pool. First, he showed that women in the county were\n both \u201cnumerous and distinct from men.\u201d 439 U. S., at 364. Second,\n to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of\n the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those\n summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsum\n mons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn. Id., at 364\u2013366.\n Finally, to show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the underrepresentation,\n he pointed to Missouri\u2019s law permitting any woman to opt out of jury\n service and to the manner in which the county administered that\n law. This Court noted that \u201cappropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemp\n tions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by\n an important state interest, id., at 370, but concluded that no such\n interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, id., at\n 369\u2013370. Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) Neither Duren nor any other decision of this Court specifies the\n method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.\n Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts be\n low\u2014absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard devia\n tion\u2014is imperfect. Absolute disparity and comparative disparity\n measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the dis\n tinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community\u2019s\n4                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jury-eligible population. And it appears that no court has relied ex\n    clusively on a standard deviation analysis. Even absent AEDPA\u2019s\n    constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the\n    appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.\n    Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith\u2019s statis\n    tical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under\n    either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court neverthe\n    less gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in\n    order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the extent\n    underrepresentation existed, was it due to \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d?\n    See Duren, 439 U. S., at 364. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (c) Smith\u2019s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason\n    to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any\n    significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Cir\n    cuit Court venires. Although the record established that some\n    County officials believed that the assignment order created racial\n    disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief\n    was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence. He introduced no evi\n    dence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit\n    Court\u2019s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Dis\n    trict Court for Grand Rapids, which had the County\u2019s largest African-\n    American population. He did not address whether Grand Rapids had\n    more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent\n    County. And he did not compare the African-American representa\n    tion levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District\n    Court venires for the same region. See Duren, 439 U. S., at 367,\n    n. 25. Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline\n    in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent\n    County reversed its assignment order. But that evidence indicated\n    no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the\n    original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the\n    representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. Pp.\n    13\u201314.\n       (d) In addition to renewing his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument, Smith urges\n    that a laundry list of factors\u2014e.g., the County\u2019s practice of excusing\n    prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and\n    the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\n    appear\u2014combined to reduce systematically the number of African-\n    Americans appearing on jury lists. No \u201cclearly established\u201d prece\n    dent of this Court supports Smith\u2019s claim. Smith urges that one sen\n    tence in Duren, 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369, places the burden of proving\n    causation on the State. But Smith clipped that sentence from its con\n    text: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face\n    case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show to rebut the de\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  fendant\u2019s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme Court was there\n  fore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), in concluding that Duren\n  first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrep\n  resentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion. This\n  Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d that jury\n  selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s list can give rise to a\n  fair-cross-section claim. Rather, the Taylor Court \u201crecognized broad\n  discretion in the States\u201d to \u201cprescribe relevant qualifications for their\n  jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.\u201d 419 U. S., at 537\u2013538.\n  And in Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions re\n  sembling those Smith assails might well \u201csurvive a fair-cross-section\n  challenge.\u201d 439 U.

Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975). The ques\ntion presented in this case is whether that right was ac\ncorded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American\nconvicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in\nKent County, Michigan in 1993. At the time of Smith\u2019s\ntrial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent\nCounty\u2019s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from\nwhich potential jurors were drawn.\n   In Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), this Court\ndescribed three showings a criminal defendant must make\nto establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amend\nment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement. He or she must\nshow: \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018dis\ntinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representa\ntion of this group in venires from which juries are selected\nis not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of\nsuch persons in the community; and (3) that this under\n2                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group\nin the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 364. The first show\ning is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are\nmore likely to generate controversy.\n   The defendant in Duren readily met all three measures.\nHe complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson\nCounty, Missouri, jury pool. To establish underrepresen\ntation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible\npopulation, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons\nsummoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons\non the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors\nwere drawn. To show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the under\nrepresentation, Duren pointed to Missouri\u2019s law exempt\ning women from jury service, and to the manner in which\nJackson County administered the exemption. Concluding\nthat no significant state interest could justify Missouri\u2019s\nexplicitly gender-based exemption, this Court held the\nlaw, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the\nSixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement.\n   We here review the decision of the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith \u201csat\nisf[ied] the prima facie test established by Duren,\u201d and\ngranting him habeas corpus relief, i.e., release from im\nprisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 order. 543 F. 3d 326, 336 (2008).\nDespite marked differences between Smith\u2019s case and\nDuren\u2019s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision\nholding that Smith \u201cha[d] not shown . . . systematic exclu\nsion,\u201d People v. Smith, 463 Mich. 199, 205, 615 N. W. 2d 1,\n3 (2000), the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled. Cog\nnizant of the restrictions Congress placed on federal ha\nbeas review of state-court convictions, the Court of Ap\npeals considered that a decision contrary to its own would\n\u201cinvolv[e] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). 543 F. 3d,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 335.\n   The Sixth Circuit erred in so ruling. No decision of this\nCourt \u201cclearly establishe[s]\u201d Smith\u2019s entitlement to fed\neral-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith\nhad demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror\nassignment procedure, which Smith calls \u201csiphoning,\u201d\n\u201csystematic[ally] exclu[ded]\u201d African-Americans. Under\nthis procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors\nfirst to local district courts, and, only after filling local\nneeds, made remaining persons available to the county\nwide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected\nSmith\u2019s \u201csiphoning\u201d plea for lack of proof that the assign\nment procedure caused underrepresentation. Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. As that determination\nwas not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no\nwarrant to disturb it. See \u00a72254(d)(2).\n   In addition to renewal of his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument,\nSmith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce\nsystematically the number of African-Americans appear\ning on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent\nCounty court\u2019s practice of excusing people without ade\nquate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent\nCounty police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\nappear. Brief for Respondent 53\u201354. Our decisions do not\naddress factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cau\ntioned, however, that \u201c[t]he fair-cross-section principle\nmust have much leeway in application.\u201d Taylor, 419 U. S.,\nat 537\u2013538; see id., at 537 (Court\u2019s holding that Sixth\nAmendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women\nfrom jury service \u201cdoes not augur or authorize the fashion\ning of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts.\u201d).\n                         I\n                        A\n  On November 7, 1991, Christopher Rumbley was shot\n4                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nThe bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to\n300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were\nAfrican-American. The State charged Smith with the\nmurder in Kent County Circuit Court.\n   Voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial took place in September 1993.\nThe venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals.\nThe parties agree that, at most, three venire members\nwere African-American. Smith unsuccessfully objected to\nthe composition of the venire panel.\n   Smith\u2019s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury.\nThe case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the\nman who shot Rumbley. Thirty-seven witnesses from the\nbar, including Smith, testified at the trial. Of those, two\ntestified that Smith fired the gun. Five testified that the\nshooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identi\nfications of the shooter. The jury convicted Smith of sec\nond-degree murder and possession of a firearm during a\nfelony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment\nwith the possibility of parole.\n                              B\n   On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered\nthe trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on\nSmith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim. The hearing occurred in\nearly 1998. Smith\u2019s evidence showed that Grand Rapids,\nthe largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37%\nof Kent County\u2019s population, and to 85% of its African-\nAmerican residents. Felony charges in Kent County were\ntried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prose\ncuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geo\ngraphical area. To fill the courts\u2019 venires, Kent County\nsent questionnaires to prospective jurors. The Circuit\nCourt Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms\nwere returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20%\nwere not answered. App. 13a.

After filling the district courts\u2019\nneeds, the County assigned the remaining prospective\njurors to the Circuit Court\u2019s panels. Id., at 20a, 22a.\n   The month after voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial, Kent County\nreversed the assignment order. It did so, according to the\nCircuit Court Administrator, based on \u201c[t]he belief . . . that\nthe respective districts essentially swallowed up most of\nthe minority jurors,\u201d leaving the Circuit Court with a jury\npool that \u201cdid not represent the entire county.\u201d Id., at 22a.\nThe Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair\ntestified, held the same view concerning the impact of\nchoosing district court jurors first and not returning un\nused persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selec\ntions. Id., at 64a\u201365a.\n   The trial court considered two means of measuring the\nextent of underrepresentation of African-Americans on\nCircuit Court venires: \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d and \u201ccompara\ntive disparity.\u201d \u201cAbsolute disparity\u201d is determined by\nsubtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the\njury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith\u2019s\ntrial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the\nlocal, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). By an abso\nlute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were\nunderrepresented by 1.28%. \u201cComparative disparity\u201d is\ndetermined by dividing the absolute disparity (here,\n1.28%) by the group\u2019s representation in the jury-eligible\npopulation (here, 7.28%).       The quotient (here, 18%),\nshowed that, in the six months prior to Smith\u2019s trial,\nAfrican-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when\ncompared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on\nthe jury-service list. App. to Pet. for Cert. 215a.\n   Isolating the month Smith\u2019s jury was selected, Smith\u2019s\n6                    BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity\nwas 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent\nCounty discontinued the district-court-first assignment\npolicy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped\nfrom 18% to 15.1%. Id., at 102a\u2013103a, 113a.\n  Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in\ndemographics and economics, who tied the underrepresen\ntation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the\nexpert explained, these forces made African-Americans\nless likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility\nquestionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship ex\ncuse. Id., at 79a\u201380a.\n  The hearing convinced the trial court that African-\nAmericans were underrepresented in Circuit Court veni\nres. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith\u2019s evidence was\ninsufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror\nassignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection\nprocess, had systematically excluded African-Americans.\nId., at 210a\u2013212a. The court therefore rejected Smith\u2019s\nfair-cross-section claim.\n                             C\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror\nallocation system in place at the relevant time did result\nin the underrepresentation of African-Americans. Id., at\n182a\u2013183a. Reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, the\nintermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with\njurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\norder installed shortly after the voir dire in Smith\u2019s case.\nIbid.; see supra, at 5.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment, concluding that Smith \u201cha[d]\nnot established a prima facie violation of the Sixth\nAmendment fair-cross-section requirement.\u201d Smith, 463\nMich., at 207, 615 N. W. 2d, at 4. The Michigan High\nCourt observed, first, that this Court has specified \u201c[no]\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npreferred method for measuring whether representation of\na distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.\u201d\nId., at 203, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2. The court then noted that\nlower federal courts had applied three different methods\nto measure fair and reasonable representation: the abso\nlute and comparative disparity tests, described supra, at 5,\nand \u201cthe standard deviation test.\u201d1\n   Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,\nthe Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case\napproach allowing consideration of all three means of\nmeasuring underrepresentation. Smith, 463 Mich., at\n204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Smith\u2019s statistical evidence, the\ncourt found, \u201cfailed to establish a legally significant dis\nparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity\ntests.\u201d Id., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. (The parties\nhad presented no expert testimony regarding application\nof the standard deviation test. Id., at 204, n. 1, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 3, n. 1; supra, at 5\u20136.)\n   Nevertheless \u201cgrant[ing] [Smith] the benefit of the doubt\non unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,\u201d the\nMichigan Supreme Court ultimately determined that \u201che\nha[d] not shown systematic exclusion.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich.,\nat 203, 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2, 3. Smith\u2019s evidence, the\ncourt said, did not show \u201chow the alleged siphoning of\nAfrican American jurors to district courts affected the\ncircuit court jury pool.\u201d Id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. In\nparticular, the court observed, \u201c[t]he record does not dis\nclose whether the district court jury pools contained more,\nfewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority\njurors as the circuit court jury pool.\u201d Ibid. The court also\nruled that \u201cthe influence of social and economic factors on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that\n\nthe disparity between a group\u2019s jury-eligible population and the group\u2019s\npercentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance.\nSee People v. Smith, 463 Mich. 199, 219\u2013220, 615 N. W. 2d 1, 9\u201310\n(2000) (Cavanagh, J., concurring).\n8                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njuror participation does not demonstrate a systematic\nexclusion.\u201d Id., at 206, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n                              D\n   In February 2003, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition\nin the United States District Court for the Western Dis\ntrict of Michigan, reasserting his fair-cross-section claim.\nBecause Smith is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of\na State court,\u201d the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a72254, governed the District\nCourt\u2019s review of his application for federal habeas corpus\nrelief. Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified\nin \u00a72254(d), a state prisoner\u2019s application may not be\ngranted as to \u201cany claim . . . adjudicated . . . in State\ncourt\u201d unless the state court\u2019s adjudication\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nApplying these standards, the District Court dismissed\nSmith\u2019s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a\u201342a.\n  The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the\nallegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled,\ncourts should use the comparative disparity test to meas\nure underrepresentation. 543 F. 3d, at 338. In that\ncourt\u2019s view, Smith\u2019s comparative disparity statistics\nsufficed \u201cto demonstrate that the representation of African\nAmerican veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and\nunreasonable.\u201d Ibid. As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth\nCircuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appel\nlate court, believed that the juror-assignment order in\neffect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled significantly\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreduced the number of African-Americans available for\nCircuit Court venires. Id., at 342. Smith was entitled to\nrelief, the court concluded, because no important state\ninterest supported that allocation system. Id., at 345.2\n  The State petitioned for certiorari attacking the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s decision on two principal grounds: First, the\nState charged that the federal appellate court erred in\nadopting the comparative disparity test to determine\nwhether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the\njury pool. Pet. for Cert. ii. Second, the State urged that,\nin any event, \u201cthere was no . . . systematic exclusion of\nAfrican Americans from juries in Kent County, Michigan,\u201d\nid., at 25, and no warrant for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s contrary\ndetermination.3 We granted review, 557 U. S. ____ (2009),\nand now reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n  According to the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment plea \u201cin\nvolved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by [this Court in Duren].\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Sixth Circuit also found that the Michigan Supreme Court had\n\nunreasonably applied Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), when it\ndeclared that social and economic factors could not establish systematic\nexclusion. 543 F. 3d, at 341\u2013342. Because such factors disproportion\nately affect African-Americans, the Sixth Circuit said, Kent County\u2019s\nroutine grants of certain hardship exemptions \u201cproduced systematic\nexclusion within the meaning of Duren.\u201d Ibid. The Sixth Circuit held,\nhowever, that the hardship exemptions could not establish a fair-cross\nsection claim because the State \u201chas a significant interest [in] avoiding\nundue burdens on individuals\u201d by allowing such excuses. Id., at 345.\n  3 Although the question presented by the State homes in on the\n\nproper measure for underrepresentation, it initially and more compre\nhensively inquires whether Smith was denied his right to a jury drawn\nfrom a fair cross section of the community. See Pet. for Cert. ii (asking\n\u201c[w]hether the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in\nconcluding that the Michigan Supreme Court failed to apply \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 Supreme Court precedent under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 on the\nissue of the fair cross-section requirement under Duren . . . .\u201d). We\ntherefore address that overarching issue.\n10                  BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(d)(1); see 543 F. 3d, at 345. We disagree. As ex\nplained below, our Duren decision hardly establishes\u2014no\nless \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth\nAmendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair\ncross section of the community.\n                              II\n   To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross\nsection requirement, this Court\u2019s pathmarking decision in\nDuren instructs, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group\nqualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and reasonably\nrepresented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d\nin the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepre\nsentation. 439 U. S., at 364; see supra, at 1\u20132.\n   The defendant in Duren successfully challenged Jackson\nCounty\u2019s administration of a Missouri exemption permit\nting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U. S., at\n360. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant\nDuren had established a prima facie case. First, women in\nJackson County were both \u201cnumerous and distinct from\nmen.\u201d Id., at 364 (quoting Taylor, 419 U. S., at 531).\nSecond, Duren\u2019s \u201cstatistical presentation\u201d showed gross\nunderrepresentation: Women were over half the jury\neligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for\nless than 15% of jury venires. 439 U. S., at 364\u2013366.\n   Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with\nparticularity. He proved that women\u2019s underrepresenta\ntion was persistent\u2014occurring in every weekly venire for\nalmost a year\u2014and he identified the two stages of the\njury-selection process \u201cwhen . . . the systematic exclusion\ntook place.\u201d Id., at 366. First, questionnaires for prospec\ntive jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out\nof jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were\nfemale, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed\nthe exemption at the questionnaire stage. Ibid. \u201cMore\nover, at the summons stage women were . . . given another\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nopportunity to [opt out].\u201d Id., at 366\u2013367. And if a woman\nignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out;\nno further inquiry was made. Id., at 367. At this \u201cfinal,\nvenire, stage,\u201d women\u2019s representation plummeted to\n14.5%. Ibid. In the Federal District Court serving the\nsame territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only\nchildcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of\nthose actually serving on juries. See ibid., n. 25.\n   The \u201cdisproportionate and consistent exclusion of\nwomen from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the\nvenire stage,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cwas quite obviously\ndue to the system by which juries were selected.\u201d Id., at\n367. \u201c[A]ppropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemptions, the\nCourt added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section\nchallenge if justified by an important state interest. Id.,\nat 370. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify\nMissouri\u2019s exemption for each and every woman\u2014the\naltogether evident explanation for the underrepresenta\ntion. Id., at 369\u2013370.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see\nsupra, at 6, neither Duren nor any other decision of this\nCourt specifies the method or test courts must use to\nmeasure the representation of distinctive groups in jury\npools. The courts below and the parties noted three meth\nods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions:\nabsolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard\ndeviation. See Smith, 463 Mich., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26;\nsupra, at 6\u20137.\n   Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and compara\ntive disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can\nbe misleading when, as here, \u201cmembers of the distinctive\ngroup comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible\n12                      BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor jury service.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich., at 203\u2013204, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133. And to our knowledge, \u201c[n]o court . . . has\naccepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determi\nnative in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection\nsystems.\u201d United States v. Rioux, 97 F. 3d 648, 655 (CA2\n1996).\n  On direct review, as earlier stated, the Michigan Su\npreme Court chose no single method \u201cto measur[e]\nwhether representation was fair and reasonable.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3; see supra, at 7.\nInstead, it \u201cadopt[ed] a case-by-case approach.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. \u201cProvided that the\nparties proffer sufficient evidence,\u201d that court said, \u201cthe\nresults of all of the tests [should be considered].\u201d Ibid. In\ncontrast, the Sixth Circuit declared that \u201c[w]here the\ndistinctive group alleged to have been underrepresented is\nsmall, as is the case here, the comparative disparity test is\nthe more appropriate measure of underrepresentation.\u201d\n543 F. 3d, at 338.\n  Even in the absence of AEDPA\u2019s constraint, see supra,\nat 8, we would have no cause to take sides today on the\nmethod or methods by which underrepresentation is ap\npropriately measured.4 Although the Michigan Supreme\nCourt concluded that \u201c[Smith\u2019s] statistical evidence failed\nto establish a legally significant disparity under either the\nabsolute or comparative disparity tests,\u201d Smith, 463 Mich.,\nat 204\u2013205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3,5 that court nevertheless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The State asks us to \u201cadopt the absolute-disparity standard for\n\nmeasuring fair and reasonable representation\u201d and to \u201crequir[e] proof\nthat the absolute disparity exceeds 10%\u201d to make out a prima facie fair\ncross-section violation. Brief for Petitioner 45\u201346. Under the rule the\nState proposes, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment offers no remedy for complete\nexclusion of distinct groups in communities where the population of the\ndistinct group falls below the 10 percent threshold.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 35. We need not reach that issue.\n  5 For similar conclusions, see, for example, United States v.

It did so in order to\nreach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the\nextent underrepresentation existed, was it due to \u201csystem\natic exclusion\u201d? Ibid.; see Duren, 439 U. S., at 364.\n                             B\n   Addressing the ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested\nits decision, Smith submits that the district-court-first\nassignment order systematically excluded African-\nAmericans from Kent County Circuit Court venires. Brief\nfor Respondent 46\u201348. But as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt not at all unreasonably concluded, Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3, Smith\u2019s evidence scarcely\nshows that the assignment order he targets caused under\nrepresentation. Although the record established that\nsome officials and others in Kent County believed that the\nassignment order created racial disparities, and the\nCounty reversed the order in response, supra, at 5, the\nbelief was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence.\n   Evidence that African-Americans were underrepre\nsented on the Circuit Court\u2019s venires in significantly\nhigher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District\nCourt\u2019s could have indicated that the assignment order\nmade a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.\nSee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Nor did\nSmith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the\nCounty\u2019s largest African-American population, \u201cha[d] more\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n3.57%; comparative disparities \u201crang[ing] from 38.17% to 51.22%\u201d); \n\nUnited States v. Royal, 174 F. 3d 1, 10 (CA1 1999) (2.97% absolute\n\ndisparity; 61.1% comparative disparity); United States v. Rioux, 97\n\nF. 3d 648, 657\u2013658 (CA2 1996) (2.08% absolute disparity; 29% com\nparative disparity); State v. Gibbs, 254 Conn. 578, 591\u2013593, 758 A. 2d\n327, 337\u2013338 (2000) (2.49% absolute disparity; 37% comparative\ndisparity).\n14                  BERGHUIS v.

Furthermore,\nSmith did not endeavor to compare the African-American\nrepresentation levels in Circuit Court venires with those\nin the Federal District Court venires for the same region.\nSee id., at 46\u201347; Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n. 25.\n  Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was of\nfered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in\ncomparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after\nKent County reversed the assignment order. See supra, at\n5. This evidence\u2014particularly in view of AEDPA\u2019s in\nstruction, \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014is insufficient to support Smith\u2019s\nclaim that the assignment order caused the underrepre\nsentation. As Smith\u2019s counsel recognized at oral argu\nment, this decrease could not fairly be described as \u201ca big\nchange.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see ibid. (the drop was \u201ca\nstep in the right direction\u201d). In short, Smith\u2019s evidence\ngave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude\nthat the district-court-first assignment order had a signifi\ncantly adverse impact on the representation of African-\nAmericans on Circuit Court venires.\n                               C\n  To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the\ndefendant must show only that the underrepresentation is\npersistent and \u201cproduced by the method or \u2018system\u2019 used to\nselect [jurors],\u201d rather than by chance. Brief for Respon\ndent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list\nof factors in addition to the alleged \u201csiphoning\u201d that, he\nurges, rank as \u201csystematic\u201d causes of underrepresentation\nof African-Americans in Kent County\u2019s jury pool. Id., at\n53\u201354. Smith\u2019s list includes the County\u2019s practice of ex\ncusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply\nfailed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail\nnotices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of\nresidential addresses at least 15 months old, and the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Ibid.\n   No \u201cclearly established\u201d precedent of this Court supports\nSmith\u2019s claim that he can make out a prima facie case\nmerely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or\nin combination, might contribute to a group\u2019s underrepre\nsentation. Smith recites a sentence in our Duren opinion\nthat, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on\nthe State. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. The sentence reads:\n\u201cAssuming, arguendo, that the exemptions mentioned by\nthe court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and\ngovernment workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair\ncommunity cross section on jury venires, the State must\ndemonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the\nwomen\u2019s exemption] caused the underrepresentation\ncomplained of.\u201d 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369. That sentence\nappears after the Court had already assigned to Duren\u2014\nand found he had carried\u2014the burden of proving that the\nunderrepresentation \u201cwas due to [women\u2019s] systematic\nexclusion in the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 366. The\nCourt\u2019s comment, which Smith clipped from its context,\ndoes not concern the demonstration of a prima face case.\nInstead, it addresses what the State might show to rebut\nthe defendant\u2019s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt was therefore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1),\nin concluding that Duren first and foremost required\nSmith himself to show that the underrepresentation com\nplained of was \u201cdue to systematic exclusion.\u201d Id., at 364;\nsee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n   This Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d\nthat jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s\nlist can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim. In Taylor,\nwe \u201crecognized broad discretion in the States\u201d to \u201cpre\nscribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to pro\nvide reasonable exemptions.\u201d 419 U.

Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nCriminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an im\n  partial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. See\n  Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522. To establish a prima facie viola\n  tion of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove\n  that: (1) a group qualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and rea\n  sonably represented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d in\n  the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.\n  Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.\n     At voir dire in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent\n  Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60\n  and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.\n  At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the County\u2019s\n  jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential ju\n  rors were drawn. The court rejected Smith\u2019s objection to the panel\u2019s\n  racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree\n  murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him\n  to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n     On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court con\n  ducted an evidentiary hearing on Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n  The evidence at the hearing showed, inter alia, that under the juror\n  assignment order in effect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled, the\n  County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and,\n  only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the\n  countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\n  Smith calls this procedure \u201csiphoning.\u201d The month after Smith\u2019s voir\n  dire, however, the County reversed course and adopted a Circuit-\n  Court-first assignment order. It did so based on the belief that the\n  district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit\n2                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County. The\n    trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of\n    African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. First, the court de\n    scribed the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d test, under which the percentage of\n    African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the per\n    centage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). According to this measure, African-Americans were under\n    represented by 1.28%. Next, the court set out the \u201ccomparative dis\n    parity\u201d test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by\n    the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, African-\n    Americans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury\n    eligible population, to be on the jury-service list. In the 11 months\n    after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment\n    policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to\n    15.1%. The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans\n    were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires. But Smith\u2019s evi\n    dence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror\n    assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had\n    systematically excluded African-Americans. The court therefore re\n    jected Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n       The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new\n    trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\n    order. Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded\n    that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment vio\n    lation. This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no\n    preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinc\n    tive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable. The court noted\n    that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and\n    comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test. Adopting\n    a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of\n    measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had\n    failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measure\n    ment. Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on under\n    representation, the court determined that he had not shown system\n    atic exclusion.\n       Smith then filed a federal habeas petition. The Antiterrorism and\n    Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal ha\n    beas relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision\n    that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n    clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n    of the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a deci\n    sion that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n    light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\n  decision when assessed under AEDPA\u2019s standards, the District Court\n  dismissed Smith\u2019s petition. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Court of\n  Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity\n  test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly ex\n  cluded group is small. The court then held that Smith\u2019s comparative\n  disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans\u2019 represen\n  tation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.\n  It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion. In accord\n  with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit be\n  lieved that the district-court-first assignment order significantly re\n  duced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court\n  venires. Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, be\n  cause no important state interest supported the district-court-first al\n  location system.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme\n Court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly\n established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). Duren hardly establishes\u2014no\n less \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right\n to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the commu\n nity. Pp. 10\u201316.\n    (a) The Duren defendant readily met all three parts of the Court\u2019s\n prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a\n county\u2019s jury pool. First, he showed that women in the county were\n both \u201cnumerous and distinct from men.\u201d 439 U. S., at 364. Second,\n to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of\n the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those\n summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsum\n mons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn. Id., at 364\u2013366.\n Finally, to show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the underrepresentation,\n he pointed to Missouri\u2019s law permitting any woman to opt out of jury\n service and to the manner in which the county administered that\n law. This Court noted that \u201cappropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemp\n tions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by\n an important state interest, id., at 370, but concluded that no such\n interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, id., at\n 369\u2013370. Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) Neither Duren nor any other decision of this Court specifies the\n method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.\n Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts be\n low\u2014absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard devia\n tion\u2014is imperfect. Absolute disparity and comparative disparity\n measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the dis\n tinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community\u2019s\n4                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jury-eligible population. And it appears that no court has relied ex\n    clusively on a standard deviation analysis. Even absent AEDPA\u2019s\n    constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the\n    appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.\n    Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith\u2019s statis\n    tical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under\n    either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court neverthe\n    less gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in\n    order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the extent\n    underrepresentation existed, was it due to \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d?\n    See Duren, 439 U. S., at 364. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (c) Smith\u2019s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason\n    to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any\n    significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Cir\n    cuit Court venires. Although the record established that some\n    County officials believed that the assignment order created racial\n    disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief\n    was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence. He introduced no evi\n    dence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit\n    Court\u2019s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Dis\n    trict Court for Grand Rapids, which had the County\u2019s largest African-\n    American population. He did not address whether Grand Rapids had\n    more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent\n    County. And he did not compare the African-American representa\n    tion levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District\n    Court venires for the same region. See Duren, 439 U. S., at 367,\n    n. 25. Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline\n    in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent\n    County reversed its assignment order. But that evidence indicated\n    no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the\n    original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the\n    representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. Pp.\n    13\u201314.\n       (d) In addition to renewing his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument, Smith urges\n    that a laundry list of factors\u2014e.g., the County\u2019s practice of excusing\n    prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and\n    the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\n    appear\u2014combined to reduce systematically the number of African-\n    Americans appearing on jury lists. No \u201cclearly established\u201d prece\n    dent of this Court supports Smith\u2019s claim. Smith urges that one sen\n    tence in Duren, 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369, places the burden of proving\n    causation on the State. But Smith clipped that sentence from its con\n    text: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face\n    case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show to rebut the de\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975). The ques\ntion presented in this case is whether that right was ac\ncorded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American\nconvicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in\nKent County, Michigan in 1993. At the time of Smith\u2019s\ntrial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent\nCounty\u2019s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from\nwhich potential jurors were drawn.\n   In Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), this Court\ndescribed three showings a criminal defendant must make\nto establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amend\nment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement. He or she must\nshow: \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018dis\ntinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representa\ntion of this group in venires from which juries are selected\nis not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of\nsuch persons in the community; and (3) that this under\n2                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group\nin the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 364. The first show\ning is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are\nmore likely to generate controversy.\n   The defendant in Duren readily met all three measures.\nHe complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson\nCounty, Missouri, jury pool. To establish underrepresen\ntation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible\npopulation, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons\nsummoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons\non the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors\nwere drawn. To show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the under\nrepresentation, Duren pointed to Missouri\u2019s law exempt\ning women from jury service, and to the manner in which\nJackson County administered the exemption. Concluding\nthat no significant state interest could justify Missouri\u2019s\nexplicitly gender-based exemption, this Court held the\nlaw, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the\nSixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement.\n   We here review the decision of the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith \u201csat\nisf[ied] the prima facie test established by Duren,\u201d and\ngranting him habeas corpus relief, i.e., release from im\nprisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 order. 543 F. 3d 326, 336 (2008).\nDespite marked differences between Smith\u2019s case and\nDuren\u2019s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision\nholding that Smith \u201cha[d] not shown . . . systematic exclu\nsion,\u201d People v.

No decision of this\nCourt \u201cclearly establishe[s]\u201d Smith\u2019s entitlement to fed\neral-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith\nhad demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror\nassignment procedure, which Smith calls \u201csiphoning,\u201d\n\u201csystematic[ally] exclu[ded]\u201d African-Americans. Under\nthis procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors\nfirst to local district courts, and, only after filling local\nneeds, made remaining persons available to the county\nwide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected\nSmith\u2019s \u201csiphoning\u201d plea for lack of proof that the assign\nment procedure caused underrepresentation. Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. As that determination\nwas not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no\nwarrant to disturb it. See \u00a72254(d)(2).\n   In addition to renewal of his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument,\nSmith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce\nsystematically the number of African-Americans appear\ning on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent\nCounty court\u2019s practice of excusing people without ade\nquate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent\nCounty police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\nappear. Brief for Respondent 53\u201354. Our decisions do not\naddress factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cau\ntioned, however, that \u201c[t]he fair-cross-section principle\nmust have much leeway in application.\u201d Taylor, 419 U.

SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nThe bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to\n300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were\nAfrican-American. The State charged Smith with the\nmurder in Kent County Circuit Court.\n   Voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial took place in September 1993.\nThe venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals.\nThe parties agree that, at most, three venire members\nwere African-American. Smith unsuccessfully objected to\nthe composition of the venire panel.\n   Smith\u2019s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury.\nThe case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the\nman who shot Rumbley. Thirty-seven witnesses from the\nbar, including Smith, testified at the trial. Of those, two\ntestified that Smith fired the gun. Five testified that the\nshooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identi\nfications of the shooter. The jury convicted Smith of sec\nond-degree murder and possession of a firearm during a\nfelony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment\nwith the possibility of parole.\n                              B\n   On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered\nthe trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on\nSmith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim. The hearing occurred in\nearly 1998. Smith\u2019s evidence showed that Grand Rapids,\nthe largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37%\nof Kent County\u2019s population, and to 85% of its African-\nAmerican residents. Felony charges in Kent County were\ntried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prose\ncuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geo\ngraphical area. To fill the courts\u2019 venires, Kent County\nsent questionnaires to prospective jurors. The Circuit\nCourt Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms\nwere returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20%\nwere not answered. App. 13a. From the pool of prospec\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at 21a. Kent County\nthen assigned nonexempt prospective jurors to their local\ndistrict courts\u2019 venires. After filling the district courts\u2019\nneeds, the County assigned the remaining prospective\njurors to the Circuit Court\u2019s panels. Id., at 20a, 22a.\n   The month after voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial, Kent County\nreversed the assignment order. It did so, according to the\nCircuit Court Administrator, based on \u201c[t]he belief . . . that\nthe respective districts essentially swallowed up most of\nthe minority jurors,\u201d leaving the Circuit Court with a jury\npool that \u201cdid not represent the entire county.\u201d Id., at 22a.\nThe Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair\ntestified, held the same view concerning the impact of\nchoosing district court jurors first and not returning un\nused persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selec\ntions. Id., at 64a\u201365a.\n   The trial court considered two means of measuring the\nextent of underrepresentation of African-Americans on\nCircuit Court venires: \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d and \u201ccompara\ntive disparity.\u201d \u201cAbsolute disparity\u201d is determined by\nsubtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the\njury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith\u2019s\ntrial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the\nlocal, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). By an abso\nlute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were\nunderrepresented by 1.28%. \u201cComparative disparity\u201d is\ndetermined by dividing the absolute disparity (here,\n1.28%) by the group\u2019s representation in the jury-eligible\npopulation (here, 7.28%).       The quotient (here, 18%),\nshowed that, in the six months prior to Smith\u2019s trial,\nAfrican-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when\ncompared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on\nthe jury-service list. App. to Pet. for Cert. 215a.\n   Isolating the month Smith\u2019s jury was selected, Smith\u2019s\n6                    BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity\nwas 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent\nCounty discontinued the district-court-first assignment\npolicy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped\nfrom 18% to 15.1%. Id., at 102a\u2013103a, 113a.\n  Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in\ndemographics and economics, who tied the underrepresen\ntation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the\nexpert explained, these forces made African-Americans\nless likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility\nquestionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship ex\ncuse. Id., at 79a\u201380a.\n  The hearing convinced the trial court that African-\nAmericans were underrepresented in Circuit Court veni\nres. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith\u2019s evidence was\ninsufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror\nassignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection\nprocess, had systematically excluded African-Americans.\nId., at 210a\u2013212a. The court therefore rejected Smith\u2019s\nfair-cross-section claim.\n                             C\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror\nallocation system in place at the relevant time did result\nin the underrepresentation of African-Americans. Id., at\n182a\u2013183a. Reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, the\nintermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with\njurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\norder installed shortly after the voir dire in Smith\u2019s case.\nIbid.; see supra, at 5.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment, concluding that Smith \u201cha[d]\nnot established a prima facie violation of the Sixth\nAmendment fair-cross-section requirement.\u201d Smith, 463\nMich., at 207, 615 N. W. 2d, at 4. The Michigan High\nCourt observed, first, that this Court has specified \u201c[no]\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

W. 2d, at 2. The court then noted that\nlower federal courts had applied three different methods\nto measure fair and reasonable representation: the abso\nlute and comparative disparity tests, described supra, at 5,\nand \u201cthe standard deviation test.\u201d1\n   Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,\nthe Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case\napproach allowing consideration of all three means of\nmeasuring underrepresentation. Smith, 463 Mich., at\n204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Smith\u2019s statistical evidence, the\ncourt found, \u201cfailed to establish a legally significant dis\nparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity\ntests.\u201d Id., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. (The parties\nhad presented no expert testimony regarding application\nof the standard deviation test. Id., at 204, n. 1, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 3, n. 1; supra, at 5\u20136.)\n   Nevertheless \u201cgrant[ing] [Smith] the benefit of the doubt\non unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,\u201d the\nMichigan Supreme Court ultimately determined that \u201che\nha[d] not shown systematic exclusion.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich.,\nat 203, 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2, 3. Smith\u2019s evidence, the\ncourt said, did not show \u201chow the alleged siphoning of\nAfrican American jurors to district courts affected the\ncircuit court jury pool.\u201d Id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. In\nparticular, the court observed, \u201c[t]he record does not dis\nclose whether the district court jury pools contained more,\nfewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority\njurors as the circuit court jury pool.\u201d Ibid. The court also\nruled that \u201cthe influence of social and economic factors on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that\n\nthe disparity between a group\u2019s jury-eligible population and the group\u2019s\npercentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance.\nSee People v.

SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njuror participation does not demonstrate a systematic\nexclusion.\u201d Id., at 206, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n                              D\n   In February 2003, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition\nin the United States District Court for the Western Dis\ntrict of Michigan, reasserting his fair-cross-section claim.\nBecause Smith is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of\na State court,\u201d the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a72254, governed the District\nCourt\u2019s review of his application for federal habeas corpus\nrelief. Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified\nin \u00a72254(d), a state prisoner\u2019s application may not be\ngranted as to \u201cany claim . . . adjudicated . . . in State\ncourt\u201d unless the state court\u2019s adjudication\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nApplying these standards, the District Court dismissed\nSmith\u2019s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a\u201342a.\n  The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the\nallegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled,\ncourts should use the comparative disparity test to meas\nure underrepresentation. 543 F. 3d, at 338. In that\ncourt\u2019s view, Smith\u2019s comparative disparity statistics\nsufficed \u201cto demonstrate that the representation of African\nAmerican veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and\nunreasonable.\u201d Ibid. As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth\nCircuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appel\nlate court, believed that the juror-assignment order in\neffect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled significantly\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreduced the number of African-Americans available for\nCircuit Court venires. Id., at 342. Smith was entitled to\nrelief, the court concluded, because no important state\ninterest supported that allocation system. Id., at 345.2\n  The State petitioned for certiorari attacking the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s decision on two principal grounds: First, the\nState charged that the federal appellate court erred in\nadopting the comparative disparity test to determine\nwhether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the\njury pool. Pet. for Cert. ii. Second, the State urged that,\nin any event, \u201cthere was no . . . systematic exclusion of\nAfrican Americans from juries in Kent County, Michigan,\u201d\nid., at 25, and no warrant for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s contrary\ndetermination.3 We granted review, 557 U. S. ____ (2009),\nand now reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n  According to the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment plea \u201cin\nvolved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by [this Court in Duren].\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Sixth Circuit also found that the Michigan Supreme Court had\n\nunreasonably applied Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), when it\ndeclared that social and economic factors could not establish systematic\nexclusion. 543 F. 3d, at 341\u2013342. Because such factors disproportion\nately affect African-Americans, the Sixth Circuit said, Kent County\u2019s\nroutine grants of certain hardship exemptions \u201cproduced systematic\nexclusion within the meaning of Duren.\u201d Ibid. The Sixth Circuit held,\nhowever, that the hardship exemptions could not establish a fair-cross\nsection claim because the State \u201chas a significant interest [in] avoiding\nundue burdens on individuals\u201d by allowing such excuses. Id., at 345.\n  3 Although the question presented by the State homes in on the\n\nproper measure for underrepresentation, it initially and more compre\nhensively inquires whether Smith was denied his right to a jury drawn\nfrom a fair cross section of the community. See Pet. for Cert. ii (asking\n\u201c[w]hether the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in\nconcluding that the Michigan Supreme Court failed to apply \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 Supreme Court precedent under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 on the\nissue of the fair cross-section requirement under Duren . . . .\u201d). We\ntherefore address that overarching issue.\n10                  BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(d)(1); see 543 F. 3d, at 345. We disagree. As ex\nplained below, our Duren decision hardly establishes\u2014no\nless \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth\nAmendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair\ncross section of the community.\n                              II\n   To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross\nsection requirement, this Court\u2019s pathmarking decision in\nDuren instructs, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group\nqualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and reasonably\nrepresented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d\nin the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepre\nsentation. 439 U. S., at 364; see supra, at 1\u20132.\n   The defendant in Duren successfully challenged Jackson\nCounty\u2019s administration of a Missouri exemption permit\nting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U. S., at\n360. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant\nDuren had established a prima facie case. First, women in\nJackson County were both \u201cnumerous and distinct from\nmen.\u201d Id., at 364 (quoting Taylor, 419 U. S., at 531).\nSecond, Duren\u2019s \u201cstatistical presentation\u201d showed gross\nunderrepresentation: Women were over half the jury\neligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for\nless than 15% of jury venires. 439 U. S., at 364\u2013366.\n   Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with\nparticularity. He proved that women\u2019s underrepresenta\ntion was persistent\u2014occurring in every weekly venire for\nalmost a year\u2014and he identified the two stages of the\njury-selection process \u201cwhen . . . the systematic exclusion\ntook place.\u201d Id., at 366. First, questionnaires for prospec\ntive jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out\nof jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were\nfemale, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed\nthe exemption at the questionnaire stage. Ibid. \u201cMore\nover, at the summons stage women were . . . given another\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nopportunity to [opt out].\u201d Id., at 366\u2013367. And if a woman\nignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out;\nno further inquiry was made. Id., at 367. At this \u201cfinal,\nvenire, stage,\u201d women\u2019s representation plummeted to\n14.5%. Ibid. In the Federal District Court serving the\nsame territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only\nchildcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of\nthose actually serving on juries. See ibid., n. 25.\n   The \u201cdisproportionate and consistent exclusion of\nwomen from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the\nvenire stage,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cwas quite obviously\ndue to the system by which juries were selected.\u201d Id., at\n367. \u201c[A]ppropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemptions, the\nCourt added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section\nchallenge if justified by an important state interest. Id.,\nat 370. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify\nMissouri\u2019s exemption for each and every woman\u2014the\naltogether evident explanation for the underrepresenta\ntion. Id., at 369\u2013370.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see\nsupra, at 6, neither Duren nor any other decision of this\nCourt specifies the method or test courts must use to\nmeasure the representation of distinctive groups in jury\npools. The courts below and the parties noted three meth\nods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions:\nabsolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard\ndeviation. See Smith, 463 Mich., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26;\nsupra, at 6\u20137.\n   Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and compara\ntive disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can\nbe misleading when, as here, \u201cmembers of the distinctive\ngroup comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible\n12                      BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor jury service.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich., at 203\u2013204, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133. And to our knowledge, \u201c[n]o court . . . has\naccepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determi\nnative in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection\nsystems.\u201d United States v. Rioux, 97 F. 3d 648, 655 (CA2\n1996).\n  On direct review, as earlier stated, the Michigan Su\npreme Court chose no single method \u201cto measur[e]\nwhether representation was fair and reasonable.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3; see supra, at 7.\nInstead, it \u201cadopt[ed] a case-by-case approach.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N.

Brief\nfor Respondent 46\u201348. But as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt not at all unreasonably concluded, Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3, Smith\u2019s evidence scarcely\nshows that the assignment order he targets caused under\nrepresentation. Although the record established that\nsome officials and others in Kent County believed that the\nassignment order created racial disparities, and the\nCounty reversed the order in response, supra, at 5, the\nbelief was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence.\n   Evidence that African-Americans were underrepre\nsented on the Circuit Court\u2019s venires in significantly\nhigher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District\nCourt\u2019s could have indicated that the assignment order\nmade a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.\nSee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Nor did\nSmith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the\nCounty\u2019s largest African-American population, \u201cha[d] more\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n3.57%; comparative disparities \u201crang[ing] from 38.17% to 51.22%\u201d); \n\nUnited States v.

Furthermore,\nSmith did not endeavor to compare the African-American\nrepresentation levels in Circuit Court venires with those\nin the Federal District Court venires for the same region.\nSee id., at 46\u201347; Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n. 25.\n  Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was of\nfered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in\ncomparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after\nKent County reversed the assignment order. See supra, at\n5. This evidence\u2014particularly in view of AEDPA\u2019s in\nstruction, \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014is insufficient to support Smith\u2019s\nclaim that the assignment order caused the underrepre\nsentation. As Smith\u2019s counsel recognized at oral argu\nment, this decrease could not fairly be described as \u201ca big\nchange.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see ibid. (the drop was \u201ca\nstep in the right direction\u201d). In short, Smith\u2019s evidence\ngave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude\nthat the district-court-first assignment order had a signifi\ncantly adverse impact on the representation of African-\nAmericans on Circuit Court venires.\n                               C\n  To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the\ndefendant must show only that the underrepresentation is\npersistent and \u201cproduced by the method or \u2018system\u2019 used to\nselect [jurors],\u201d rather than by chance. Brief for Respon\ndent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list\nof factors in addition to the alleged \u201csiphoning\u201d that, he\nurges, rank as \u201csystematic\u201d causes of underrepresentation\nof African-Americans in Kent County\u2019s jury pool. Id., at\n53\u201354. Smith\u2019s list includes the County\u2019s practice of ex\ncusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply\nfailed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail\nnotices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of\nresidential addresses at least 15 months old, and the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrefusal of Kent County police to enforce court orders for\nthe appearance of prospective jurors. Ibid.\n   No \u201cclearly established\u201d precedent of this Court supports\nSmith\u2019s claim that he can make out a prima facie case\nmerely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or\nin combination, might contribute to a group\u2019s underrepre\nsentation. Smith recites a sentence in our Duren opinion\nthat, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on\nthe State. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. The sentence reads:\n\u201cAssuming, arguendo, that the exemptions mentioned by\nthe court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and\ngovernment workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair\ncommunity cross section on jury venires, the State must\ndemonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the\nwomen\u2019s exemption] caused the underrepresentation\ncomplained of.\u201d 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369. That sentence\nappears after the Court had already assigned to Duren\u2014\nand found he had carried\u2014the burden of proving that the\nunderrepresentation \u201cwas due to [women\u2019s] systematic\nexclusion in the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 366. The\nCourt\u2019s comment, which Smith clipped from its context,\ndoes not concern the demonstration of a prima face case.\nInstead, it addresses what the State might show to rebut\nthe defendant\u2019s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt was therefore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1),\nin concluding that Duren first and foremost required\nSmith himself to show that the underrepresentation com\nplained of was \u201cdue to systematic exclusion.\u201d Id., at 364;\nsee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n   This Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d\nthat jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s\nlist can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim. In Taylor,\nwe \u201crecognized broad discretion in the States\u201d to \u201cpre\nscribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to pro\nvide reasonable exemptions.\u201d 419 U. S., at 537\u2013538. And\nin Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions\n16                       BERGHUIS v.

S., at 370.6 In sum, the\nMichigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Smith\u2019s fair\ncross-section claim is consistent with Duren and \u201cinvolved\n[no] unreasonable application o[f] clearly established\nFederal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n                      *     *     *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We have also never \u201cclearly\u201d decided, and have no need to consider\n\nhere, whether the impact of social and economic factors can support a\nfair-cross-section claim.

See, e.g., Alschuler & Deiss, A\nBrief History of the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 867, 877 (1994) (In 1791, \u201c[e]very state\nlimited jury service to men; every state except Vermont\nrestricted jury service to property owners or taxpayers;\nthree states permitted only whites to serve; and one state,\nMaryland, disqualified atheists\u201d); Taylor v.

The Court has nonetheless concluded\nthat the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the\nright to a jury that represents \u201ca fair cross section\u201d of the\ncommunity.
