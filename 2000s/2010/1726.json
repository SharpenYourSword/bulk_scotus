Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and\n  private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or\n  fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam\n  actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions\n  in, inter alia, \u201ca congressional, administrative, or Government Ac\n  counting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.\u201d 31\n  U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two\n  North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding\n  and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.\n  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in\n  volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible\n  fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po\n  tential irregularities in the contracts\u2019 administration. Subsequently,\n  Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti\n  tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,\n  knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.\n  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be\n  cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega\n  tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held\n  were \u201cadministrative\u201d reports under the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar.\n  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis\n  trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.\nHeld: The reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits, and investiga\n tions in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo\n cal sources as well as federal sources. Pp. 4\u201321.\n2       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n       (a) Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures\n    that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits. The\n    language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The FCA\u2019s plain text does not limit \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\n    sources. Because that term modifies \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\n    tigation\u201d in a provision about \u201cthe public disclosure\u201d of fraud on the\n    United States, it is most naturally read to describe government\n    agency activities. But since \u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by\n    \u201cfederal,\u201d there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state\n    and local agency activities from its ambit. The interpretive maxim\n    noscitur a sociis\u2014\u201ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\u201d\n    Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519\u2014does not\n    support the Fourth Circuit\u2019s more limited view. In Category 2, \u201cad\n    ministrative\u201d is sandwiched between the federal terms \u201ccongres\n    sional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d but these items are too few and too disparate to\n    qualify as \u201ca string of statutory terms,\u201d S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine\n    Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or \u201citems in a\n    list,\u201d Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so\n    ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating \u201cadministrative\u201d within the\n    public disclosure bar\u2019s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate\n    gory 2\u2019s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate\n    gory 1 (\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing\u201d) and Category 3\n    (\u201cnews media\u201d) that are generally understood to include nonfederal\n    sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (\u201cadministrative\u201d)\n    that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to\n    adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi\n    legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis\n    lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely\n    to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state\n    and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The\n    FCA\u2019s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question\n    whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.\n    And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in\n    \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state\n    administrative sources. Pp. 5\u201312.\n       (c) The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal in\n    terpretation of \u201cadministrative.\u201d The current \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) was en\n    acted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root\n    out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits. How exactly the statute\n    came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub\n    stantive changes\u2014including the introduction of \u201cadministrative\u201d in\n    Category 2\u2014were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,\n    as \u201ctechnical\u201d amendments.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a73729\u20133733, has authorized both\nthe Attorney General and private qui tam relators to\nrecover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims\nfor payment to the United States. The Act now contains a\nprovision barring qui tam actions based upon the public\ndisclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci\nfied sources. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is\nwhether the reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits,\nand investigations in that provision encompasses disclo\nsures made in state and local sources as well as federal\nsources. We hold that it does.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Pro\ntection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111\u2013148, 124 Stat. 119.\nSection 10104(j)(2) of this legislation replaces the prior version of 31\nU. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4) with new language. The legislation makes no\nmention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to\npending cases given that it eliminates petitioners\u2019 claimed defense to a\nqui tam suit. See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer,\n520 U. S. 939, 948 (1997). Throughout this opinion, we use the present\n2    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n   In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North\nCarolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to\nperform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf\nfered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed\nto shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent\nKaren T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the\nGraham County Soil and Conservation District, a special\npurpose government body that had been delegated partial\nresponsibility for coordinating and performing the reme\ndiation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection\nwith this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi\ncials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and\nhad a meeting with, agents of the USDA.\n   Graham County officials began an investigation. An\naccounting firm hired by the county performed an audit\nand, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified\nseveral potential irregularities in the county\u2019s administra\ntion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro\nlina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural\nResources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying\nsimilar problems. The USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General\neventually issued a third report that contained additional\nfindings.\n   In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition\ners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and\nWater Conservation Districts and a number of local and\nfederal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by\nknowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant\nto the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners\nretaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation\nof those false claims. Following this Court\u2019s review of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was\n\nargued. \n\n                       Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                        3\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute of limitations applicable to Wilson\u2019s retaliation\nclaim, Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v.\nUnited States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the\nCourt of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as\ntime barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the\nDistrict Court subsequently dismissed Wilson\u2019s qui tam\naction for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a\u2013\n105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute\nthat her action was based upon allegations publicly dis\nclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at\n95a\u201398a. Those reports, the District Court determined,\nconstituted \u201cadministrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or\ninvestigation[s]\u201d within the meaning of the FCA\u2019s public\ndisclosure bar, 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A).\n  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court because the reports had been generated by\nstate and local entities. \u201c[O]nly federal administrative\nreports, audits or investigations,\u201d the Fourth Circuit\nconcluded, \u201cqualify as public disclosures under the FCA.\u201d\n528 F. 3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits\nhaving divided over this issue,2 we granted certiorari to\nresolve the conflict. 557 U. S. __ (2009).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare      528 F. 3d, at 301\u2013307 (limiting this portion of the public\ndisclosure bar to federal sources), and United States ex rel. Dunleavy v.\nCounty of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745\u2013746 (CA3 1997) (same), with\nUnited States ex rel. Bly-Magee v.

Board of Regents for State\nof Ga., 468 F. 3d 755, 762 (CA11 2006) (per curiam) (assuming without\nanalysis that state audits may qualify). The Eighth Circuit appears to\nhave taken a \u201cmiddle road\u201d on this issue, 528 F. 3d, at 301, holding that\ndisclosures made in nonfederal forums may count as \u201c \u2018administrative\n. . . report[s]\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018audit[s]\u2019 \u201d under \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) in some instances, as\nwhen they relate to \u201ca cooperative federal-state program through which\nthe federal government provides financial assistance.\u201d Hays v.

WILSON \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n  We have examined the FCA\u2019s qui tam provisions in\nseveral recent opinions.3 At issue in this case is the FCA\u2019s\npublic disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction\nover qui tam suits when the relevant information has\nalready entered the public domain through certain chan\nnels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction\nstripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court\nof Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300\u2013301, we have inserted\nArabic numerals to identify these categories:\n       \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin\n       istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra\n       tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,\n       hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news\n       media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney\n       General or the person bringing the action is an origi\n       nal source[4] of the information.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (foot\n       note omitted).\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective \u201cad\nministrative\u201d in the second category (Category 2): whether\nit embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as\nrespondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures\nmade in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 See,\n         e.g., Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S. 457 (2007)\n(construing \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s original source exception); Cook County v.\nUnited States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119 (2003) (holding that local\ngovernments are subject to qui tam liability); Vermont Agency of\nNatural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 (2000)\n(holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions).\n   4 A separate statutory provision defines an \u201coriginal source\u201d as \u201can\n\nindividual who has direct and independent knowledge of the informa\ntion on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided\nthe information to the Government before filing an action under this\nsection which is based on the information.\u201d 31 U.

Although there is\nsome overlap among the three types of argument, it is\nuseful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.\n                              III\n    The term \u201cadministrative\u201d \u201cmay, in various contexts,\nbear a range of related meanings,\u201d Chandler v. Judicial\nCouncil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to\nprivate bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When\nused to modify the nouns \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\ntigation,\u201d in the context of a statutory provision about \u201cthe\npublic disclosure\u201d of fraud on the United States, the term\nis most naturally read to describe the activities of govern\nmental agencies. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cadministration,\u201d \u201c[i]n\npublic law, [as] the practical management and direction of\nthe executive department and its agencies\u201d). Given that\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by \u201cfederal,\u201d there is\nno immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the\nactivities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)\nfrom its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, \u201cthe\nstatute by its express terms does not limit its reach to\nfederal administrative reports or investigations.\u201d 528\nF. 3d, at 301. \u201c[T]here is nothing inherently federal about\nthe word \u2018administrative,\u2019 and Congress did not define the\nterm in the FCA.\u201d Id., at 302.\n    The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cadministrative\u201d\nnevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its\napplication of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.\nSee id., at 302\u2013305. This maxim, literally translated as\n\u201c \u2018it is known by its associates,\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s 1160, counsels\n6       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\nlawyers reading statutes that \u201ca word may be known by\nthe company it keeps,\u201d Russell Motor Car Co. v. United\nStates, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this\nlitigation acknowledge that the terms \u201ccongressional\u201d and\n\u201c[GAO]\u201d are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative\nBranch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a\nfederal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren\nCo. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.\n370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U.

Searle & Co., 367 U.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that \u201cthe three terms in\nCategory 2 are no more \u2018distinct\u2019 or \u2018disparate\u2019 than the phrase at issue\nin Jarecki.\u201d Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We\ndisagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase \u201ccon\ngressional, administrative, or GAO\u201d is not as cohesive as the phrase\n\u201cexploration, discovery, or prospecting.\u201d That is one reason why nosci\ntur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in\nthis case. On their \u201cface,\u201d the terms \u201cexploration,\u201d \u201cdiscovery,\u201d and\n\u201cprospecting\u201d all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;\nthe centrality of such activities to \u201cthe oil and gas and mining indus\ntries\u201d gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind\nwhen it drafted the provision. 367 U.

S., at 415; where they differ is in determining\nthe relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes\nthat Category 2 is the only piece of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) that\nmatters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of\nthe sources listed in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:\nspecifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui\ntam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar\u2019s gram\nmatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify\ning to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it\ndoes not follow that we should treat these categories as\nislands unto themselves. Courts have a \u201cduty to construe\nstatutes, not isolated provisions.\u201d Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).\n   When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure\nbar, the case for limiting \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\nsources becomes significantly weaker. The \u201cnews media\u201d\nreferenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.\nThe Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and\ncertain private outlets have a national focus; but no one\ncontends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.\nThere is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the\n\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\u201d listed in\nCategory 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201ccommon feature\u201d at all, post, at 4\u2014apart from a governmental conno\ntation.

United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972)\n(\u201c[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with\na consistent meaning in a given context\u201d). Respondent\nand the Solicitor General assert that \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s two\nreferences to \u201cadministrative\u201d can be distinguished be\ncause Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudica\ntive proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to\nrefer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as\nrulemaking, oversight, and investigations. See Brief for\nRespondent 16\u201318; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 25\u201326 (hereinafter Brief for United States). Yet\neven if this reading were correct, state and local adminis\ntrative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a\nlegislative-type character are presumably just as public,\nand just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice\nof a potential fraud, as state and local administrative\nhearings of an adjudicatory character.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nSylvia, The False Claims Act: Fraud Against the Government \u00a711:35, \n\np. 642 (2004) (hereinafter Sylvia).\n   9 See Bly-Magee, 470 F. 3d, at 918 (\u201cIndeed, the statute would seem to\n\nbe inconsistent if it included state and local administrative hearings as\nsources of public disclosures [in Category 1] and then, in the next\nbreath, excluded state administrative reports as sources\u201d); In re Natu\nral Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, 467 F.

WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this\ninference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by\nfurther averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are\nthemselves only federal. See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324;\nBrief for United States 25\u201326. No court has ever taken\nsuch a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing\ncases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh\nCircuits and stating that \u201c[t]he courts have easily con\ncluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings\u201d);\nSylvia \u00a711:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The\narguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into\nCategory 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history\nand policy; they find no support in the statute\u2019s text.\n  Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to\na bird\u2019s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General\nalso maintain that the \u201cexclusively federal focus\u201d of the\nFCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to\nencompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10,\n18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has\na federal focus. But so does every other federal statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnarrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure\nstatus to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state\nand local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public\ndisclosure status to a formal public report of a state government\nagency\u201d).\n  10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent\n\nasserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.\nCalifornia, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and\nrejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.\nBrief for Respondent 23\u201324.

Spectrum Emergency\nCare, Inc., 190 F. 3d 1156, 1161, n. 6 (CA10 1999), and no lower court,\nas far as we are aware, has so much as suggested that an alternative\nconstruction might be viable. Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh\nCircuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and\nDunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on\nnotice of the possibility that \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal\nsources.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

In any event, the\n\u201cfederal focus\u201d of the statute, as a whole, does not shine\nlight on the specific question whether the public disclosure\nbar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of\n\u201cpublic disclosure\u201d\u2014not Federal Government creation or\nreceipt\u2014that is the touchstone of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A).\n   Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last\nargument grounded in the statutory text: It would be\nanomalous, they say, for state and local administrative\nreports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla\ntive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for\nUnited States 15\u201316. Yet neither respondent nor the\nSolicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners\nand their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar\nwas enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla\ntures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing\nfederally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36\u2013\n39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8\u201313. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern\nment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and\nto provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.\nWhether or not state legislative sources should have been\nincluded in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car\nries no clear implications for the status of state adminis\ntrative sources.\n   In sum, although the term \u201cadministrative\u201d may be\nsandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 On its face, \u00a73733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed\n\neral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it\ndoes, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil\ninvestigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.\nSee Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31\u201332.\n12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be\ntween phrases that have been generally understood to\ninclude nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in\nCategory 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of\nour inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the\nnoscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of\nAppeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with\nwhich \u201cadministrative\u201d keeps company in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\nendow it with an exclusively federal character.\n                             IV\n  As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources\nfrom which a relator could acquire the information to\nbring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943), we upheld the relator\u2019s recov\nery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a\nfederal criminal indictment\u2014a quintessential \u201cparasitic\u201d\nsuit. Id., at 545\u2013548; see id., at 545 (\u201cEven if, as the gov\nernment suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing\nto the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to\naccomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was\npassed\u201d). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by\namending the statute to preclude qui tam actions \u201cbased\nupon evidence or information in the possession of the\nUnited States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in\n\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(A) as \u201cclauses.\u201d See 528 F. 3d, at 300\u2013305. Were they in\nfact clauses rather than prepositional phrases, reliance on noscitur a\nsociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using\nthat term, Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 105 (1834) (Reporter\u2019s statement\nof the case), which suggested that \u201cdifferent clauses of the same sen\ntence\u201d should be presumed \u201cto embrace the subject matter of the\nsentence.\u201d The Court of Appeals\u2019 mistaken reference to \u201cclauses\u201d is of\ncourse less significant than its failure to treat the public disclosure bar\nas an integrated whole.

Congress apparently concluded\nthat a total bar on qui tam actions based on information\nalready in the Government\u2019s possession thwarted a sig\nnificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather\nthan simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how\never, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in\nan effort to strike a balance between encouraging private\npersons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits\nsuch as the one in Hess. How exactly \u00a73730(e)(4) came to\nstrike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid\nerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary\nCommittees each reported bills that contained very differ\nent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in\nthe Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not\n14    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

See S. Rep., at 42\u201343 (text of\nproposed \u00a73730(e)(4)).13\n   In respondent and her amici\u2019s view, this background\ncounsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of\n\u201cadministrative\u201d for three separate reasons. First, the\ndrafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that\nCongress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of\nthe 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov\nernment knowledge bar, and \u201c[c]onstruing [\u00a73730(e)(4)(A)]\nas limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers\nCongress\u2019s purpose \u2018to encourage more private enforce\nment suits.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,\nat 23\u201324). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed\nings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General\nwith a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA\naction based on revelations made therein, the Attorney\nGeneral is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in\nstate proceedings. Respondent and her amici further\nmaintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal\nsources in Category 2, as local governments would then be\nable to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis\ncretely disclosing evidence of fraud in \u201cpublic\u201d reports.14\n   These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but\nthey do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft\ning history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques\ntions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See   also H.

WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on\na remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill,\nSenator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for\nUnited States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and\nJustice as Amicus Curiae 13\u201314; Brief for Taxpayers\nAgainst Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30\u201331.\nIn a floor statement, Grassley said that \u201cthe term \u2018Gov\nernment\u2019 in the definition of original source is meant to\ninclude any Government source of disclosures cited in [the\npublic disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes\nCongress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or\nindependent agency as well as all other governmental\nbodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.\u201d\n132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence\nby a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful\nweight, Senator Grassley\u2019s remark merely begs the ques\ntion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether\nthe \u201cother governmental bodies\u201d may be state or local\nbodies. It also turns on a term, \u201cGovernment\u201d with a\ncapital \u201cG,\u201d that does not appear in the codified version of\nthe public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently\nrevised in numerous respects prior to passage.\n   There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record\nthat squarely corroborates respondent\u2019s reading of the\nstatute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986\namendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145\nCong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in\nwhich Rep. Berman and Sen.

In our view, neither the general trajectory of 20th\ncentury FCA reform nor the specific statements made during the 1986\nlegislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question\nbefore us.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as\nlegislative \u201chistory,\u201d given that it was written 13 years\nafter the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of\nscant or no value for our purposes.17\n   We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986\namendments to the FCA \u201cto strengthen the Government\u2019s\nhand in fighting false claims,\u201d Cook County, 538 U. S., at\n133\u2013134, and \u201cto encourage more private enforcement\nsuits,\u201d S. Rep., at 23\u201324. It is equally beyond cavil, how\never, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar\na subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or\ndownright harmful. The question before us concerns the\nprecise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record\nis all but opaque. While \u201cthe absence of specific legislative\nhistory in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty\nto give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted\nin the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting\nthe law in question,\u201d United States v.

Yet while\n\u201cthere is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in\ntandem with the FCA,\u201d Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the\nPFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no\nexplicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category\n2\u2019s reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d sources to the same set of agencies.\nThe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated\nin the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer\nence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are\naware, articulated any such intent.\n18    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n303, 310 (1976), there is no \u201cevident legislative purpose\u201d to\nguide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.\n                              V\n   Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their\ncase that petitioners\u2019 reading of the statute will lead to\nresults that Congress could not have intended. Their\nargument rests on an empirical proposition: \u201cWhile federal\ninquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De\npartment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and\nlocal reports and investigations never come to the atten\ntion of federal authorities.\u201d Brief for United States 22; see\nalso 528 F. 3d, at 306 (\u201cBecause the federal government is\nunlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a\nlarge number of fraudulent claims against the government\nwould go unremedied without the financial incentives\noffered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA\u201d). This\nproposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.\nNumerous federal investigations may be occurring at any\ngiven time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn\nabout their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about\nquite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the\ninquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state\nprogram financed in part by federal dollars, such as the\nprogram at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the\nAttorney General a typical state or local source will be, as\ncompared to a federal source, is an open question. And it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern\n\nments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See\n31 U.

It\nbears mention that, to the extent one is worried about Federal Gov\nernment ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts, see post, at 10\u2013\n11, today\u2019s ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention\nto such efforts going forward.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The statutory touchstone,\nonce again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been\n\u201cpublic[ly] disclos[ed],\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), not whether they\nhave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument also gives insufficient weight to\nCongress\u2019 decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo\nsures \u201cfrom the news media.\u201d Ibid. Because there was no\nsuch bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a\njurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion\nthat the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded\nintent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.\nAnd since the \u201cnews media\u201d include a large number of\nlocal newspapers and radio stations, this category likely\ndescribes a multitude of sources that would seldom come\nto the attention of the Attorney General.\n   As for respondent and her amici\u2019s concern that local\ngovernments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil\nity \u201cthrough careful, low key \u2018disclosures\u2019 \u201d of potential\nfraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu\nlation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any\nsuch disclosure would not immunize the local government\nfrom FCA liability in an action brought by the United\nStates, see Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.\n457, 478 (2007)\u2014and to the contrary it could tip off the\nAttorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It\nseems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view\nwhen they assert that, \u201c[g]iven the fact that the submis\nsion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen\ndant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam\nages and attorneys\u2019 fees, no rational entity would prepare\na report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of\ncutting off qui tam actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;\nsee also United States ex rel.

Today\u2019s ruling merely confirms\nthat disclosures made in one type of context\u2014a state or\nlocal report, audit, or investigation\u2014may trigger the\npublic disclosure bar.

Today, the\nCourt reads the phrase \u201cadministrative . . . report, hear\ning, audit, or investigation\u201d to encompass not only federal,\nbut also state and local, government sources. In my view,\nthe Court misreads the statutory text and gives insuffi\ncient weight to contextual and historical evidence of Con\ngress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a73730.

No\nparty here disputes that \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d refer\nonly to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.\n5\u20136. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is more capacious, potentially reaching\nnot only federal, state, and local government sources but\nalso disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \u201cadministrative\u201d as\n\u201cpertain[ing] to administration, especially management,\n. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or\nthings\u201d).\n    Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress\u2019 choice of two\n\u201cclearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed\neral term\u201d as a \u201cvery strong contextual cue about the\nmeaning of \u2018administrative.\u2019 \u201d 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4\n2008). \u201c \u2018The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an\ninescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is\ncapable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 As\n       the Court observes, in enacting \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone\nously referred to the General Accounting Office\u2014now renamed the\nGovernment Accountability Office\u2014as the \u201cGovernment Accounting\nOffice.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Here, the imme\ndiate proximity of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d suggests\nthat \u201cadministrative\u201d should be read, like its neighbors, as\nreferring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had\nintended to include state or local government administra\ntive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer\nring generically to \u201cgovernmental\u201d sources. See 528 F. 3d,\nat 304\u2013305.\n   The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a\nsociis canon in concluding that \u201cadministrative\u201d does not\nrefer to private entities because of the meaning suggested\nby the slightly more distant neighbors \u201creport, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.\u201d See ante, at 5. I agree with the\nmajority that \u201cadministrative\u201d in this context does not\nreach private entities. But in my view, \u201ccongressional\u201d\nand \u201c[GAO]\u201d provide the better textual grounding for that\nconclusion. I see no reason why the \u201cadministrati[on]\u201d of a\nprivate university, for instance, could not issue a \u201creport,\u201d\norder an \u201caudit\u201d or \u201cinvestigation,\u201d or conduct a \u201chearing.\u201d\nNor, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, are private\nentities\u2014particularly those receiving federal funds or\nparticipating in federal programs\u2014incapable of making\n\u201cpublic disclosure[s]\u201d of fraud on the Federal Government.\n   Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court\nnevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of\nnoscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,\nconcluding that \u201c[a] list of three items, each quite distinct\nfrom the other no matter how construed, is too short to be\nparticularly illuminating.\u201d Ante, at 6\u20137. The three terms\nin Category 2, the Court concludes, are \u201ctoo few and too\ndisparate\u201d to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,\nat 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this\nway, and I would not do so here.\n   To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v.

Recogniz\ning that the word \u201c \u2018[d]iscovery\u2019 \u201d is \u201cusable in many con\ntexts and with various shades of meaning,\u201d we observed\nthat it \u201cgathers meaning from the words around it\u201d and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all\ndescribe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and\nmining industries.\u201d Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of\nother contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,\nwe held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera\nequipment did not give rise to \u201cabnormal income\u201d even if\nsuch inventions might otherwise be understood as \u201cdis\ncover[ies].\u201d See id., at 307\u2013313. In my view, the three\nterms in Category 2 are no more \u201cdistinct\u201d or \u201cdisparate,\u201d\nante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly\ngiven the expansive plain meaning of \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Cf.\nante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis\nprinciple readily yields a common feature: The sources at\nissue are federal in nature, not related to state or local\ngovernments or private entities.

There is\nno conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re\nspondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively\nfederal. See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 25\u201326. Even reading Category 1\nmore broadly, however, does not change the exclusively\nfederal nature of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d which\nundermines whatever inference might be drawn from\ntaking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating\nthe entirety of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of\nitems gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress\nmade in offsetting each category with commas and prepo\nsitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that\nmodify different nouns.\n   Finally, the Court also views \u201cnews media\u201d as \u201cdistinctly\nnonfederal in nature.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. But \u201cnews media\u201d\ndoes not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As\nthe Court of Appeals observed, although media sources\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings\u201d). Because Congress did not\nemploy a completely disjunctive list in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2014i.e., \u201ccongres\nsional or administrative or [GAO]\u201d\u2014the Reiter principle applies with\nless force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U.

While the legislative record\nis concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise\ncaution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi\nble meaning\u2014i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also\nstate and local, government sources.\n    Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the\n1986 amendments, the \u201cGovernment knowledge\u201d bar\nunquestionably referred only to information in the posses\nsion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was\ncriticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an\ninitial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de\nscribed the FCA\u2019s history and need for legislative reform,\nnoting \u201cseveral restrictive court interpretations of the act\n. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 99\u2013345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For\ninstance, courts had applied the Government knowledge\nbar \u201ceven if the Government makes no effort to investigate\nor take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.\u201d\nId., at 12 (citing United States ex rel.

Rep., at 1\u20132;\naccord, H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013660, p. 18 (1986) (\u201cEvidence of\nfraud in Government programs and procurement is on a\nsteady rise\u201d). The Senate Report also articulated a desire\nto \u201cencourage any individual knowing of Government\nfraud to bring that information forward,\u201d and it identified\nas \u201cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective\nenforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the\npart of Federal enforcement agencies.\u201d S. Rep., at 2, 7.6\n  Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted\nlegislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfrom bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had\npreviously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even\nwhen the State\u2019s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,\nat 12\u201313. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was\ncontroversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the\n\u201coriginal source\u201d exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,\nWang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,\nat 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys\nGeneral criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).\n  6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator\n\nGrassley described the reform effort as stemming \u201cfrom a realization\nthat the Government needs help\u2014lots of help\u2014to adequately protect\ntaxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.\u201d\n132 Cong. Rec. 28580 (1986); see also United States ex rel. Siller v.\nBecton Dickinson & Co., 21 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (CA4 1994) (\u201cBy 1986,\nwhen section 3730(e)(4) was enacted, Congress had come to the conclu\nsion that fraud against the Government was apparently so rampant\nand difficult to identify that the Government could use all the help it\ncould get from private citizens with knowledge of fraud\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n8     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v.

The amendments also\ncontained a number of provisions facilitating enforcement generally,\ne.g., lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that\n\u201cknowing\u201d violations require \u201cno proof of specific intent to defraud,\u201d 31\nU.

Ante, at 19. But\nneither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest\npossible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on \u201cnews media\u201d disclo\nsures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of\nexisting law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge\nbar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news\nmedia. In United States ex rel. Thompson v. Hays, 432 F. Supp. 253,\n256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence\n\u201cgleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread\npublic attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],\u201d when the\nDepartment of Justice \u201cfirst obtained information regarding the claims\n. . . as a result of [a] Washington Post article.\u201d Similarly, the court in\nUnited States v. Burmah Oil Co., 558 F. 2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) (per\ncuriam) characterized the Government knowledge bar as \u201cdis\ncourag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of\ntheir own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

See S. Rep., at 10\u201311 (describing\nhistory of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); ante,\nat 12\u201313. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amend\nments as striking a balance between the \u201ctwin goals of\nrejecting suits which the government is capable of pursu\ning itself, while promoting those which the government is\nnot equipped to bring on its own.\u201d United States ex rel.\nSpringfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 651\n(CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to\nbalance two competing goals supports moderation in\ninterpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather\nthan woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest\npossible extent.\n   Third, the legislative record \u201c \u2018contains no hint of any\nintention\u2019 \u201d to bar suits based on disclosures from state or\nlocal government sources.

Inclusion of\nstate or local government sources would have constituted\na significant departure from the Federal Government\nknowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.\nBut neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and\nHouse Committees nor statements by individual Members\nof Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation\nsuggest any consideration or debate about expanding the\npre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nindictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional\ninvestigations.\u201d Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that\nnews media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would\nnaturally\u2014perhaps as a result of the reporting\u2014come to the Govern\nment\u2019s attention, and thus would already have been covered under\nexisting law.\n10       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n              DIST. v.

Today\u2019s decision risks such a\nresult. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by\nall appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the\npre-1986 regime. Construing \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) to encompass\nthe thousands of state and local government administra\ntive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the\nFederal Government knowledge of such sources, whether\nor not the Government is aware of the information or in a\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In  June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill\nthat would have barred qui tam actions based on information \u201cwhich\nthe Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior\nadministrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,\u201d \u201cdisclosed during the\ncourse of a congressional investigation,\u201d or \u201cdisseminated by any news\nmedia.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government\nitself (with a capital \u201cG\u201d) and to \u201ccongressional investigation[s]\u201d connote\nfederal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring\nactions \u201cbased upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of\na civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six\nmonths of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega\ntions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a\ncongressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or\nfrom the news media.\u201d S.

The reference to suits in which\nthe Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term\n\u201cadministrative\u201d in the bill\u2019s reference to \u201ccongressional or [GAO]\u201d\nreports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or\nlocal government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several\nrespects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record\ncontains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government\nsources.

Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and\n  private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or\n  fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam\n  actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions\n  in, inter alia, \u201ca congressional, administrative, or Government Ac\n  counting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.\u201d 31\n  U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two\n  North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding\n  and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.\n  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in\n  volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible\n  fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po\n  tential irregularities in the contracts\u2019 administration. Subsequently,\n  Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti\n  tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,\n  knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.\n  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be\n  cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega\n  tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held\n  were \u201cadministrative\u201d reports under the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar.\n  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis\n  trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.\nHeld: The reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits, and investiga\n tions in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo\n cal sources as well as federal sources. Pp. 4\u201321.\n2       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n       (a) Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures\n    that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits. The\n    language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The FCA\u2019s plain text does not limit \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\n    sources. Because that term modifies \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\n    tigation\u201d in a provision about \u201cthe public disclosure\u201d of fraud on the\n    United States, it is most naturally read to describe government\n    agency activities. But since \u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by\n    \u201cfederal,\u201d there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state\n    and local agency activities from its ambit. The interpretive maxim\n    noscitur a sociis\u2014\u201ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\u201d\n    Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519\u2014does not\n    support the Fourth Circuit\u2019s more limited view. In Category 2, \u201cad\n    ministrative\u201d is sandwiched between the federal terms \u201ccongres\n    sional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d but these items are too few and too disparate to\n    qualify as \u201ca string of statutory terms,\u201d S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine\n    Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or \u201citems in a\n    list,\u201d Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so\n    ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating \u201cadministrative\u201d within the\n    public disclosure bar\u2019s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate\n    gory 2\u2019s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate\n    gory 1 (\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing\u201d) and Category 3\n    (\u201cnews media\u201d) that are generally understood to include nonfederal\n    sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (\u201cadministrative\u201d)\n    that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to\n    adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi\n    legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis\n    lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely\n    to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state\n    and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The\n    FCA\u2019s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question\n    whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.\n    And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in\n    \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state\n    administrative sources. Pp. 5\u201312.\n       (c) The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal in\n    terpretation of \u201cadministrative.\u201d The current \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) was en\n    acted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root\n    out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits. How exactly the statute\n    came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub\n    stantive changes\u2014including the introduction of \u201cadministrative\u201d in\n    Category 2\u2014were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,\n    as \u201ctechnical\u201d amendments.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a73729\u20133733, has authorized both\nthe Attorney General and private qui tam relators to\nrecover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims\nfor payment to the United States. The Act now contains a\nprovision barring qui tam actions based upon the public\ndisclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci\nfied sources. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is\nwhether the reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits,\nand investigations in that provision encompasses disclo\nsures made in state and local sources as well as federal\nsources. We hold that it does.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Pro\ntection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.

The legislation makes no\nmention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to\npending cases given that it eliminates petitioners\u2019 claimed defense to a\nqui tam suit.

Throughout this opinion, we use the present\n2    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n   In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North\nCarolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to\nperform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf\nfered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed\nto shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent\nKaren T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the\nGraham County Soil and Conservation District, a special\npurpose government body that had been delegated partial\nresponsibility for coordinating and performing the reme\ndiation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection\nwith this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi\ncials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and\nhad a meeting with, agents of the USDA.\n   Graham County officials began an investigation. An\naccounting firm hired by the county performed an audit\nand, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified\nseveral potential irregularities in the county\u2019s administra\ntion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro\nlina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural\nResources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying\nsimilar problems. The USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General\neventually issued a third report that contained additional\nfindings.\n   In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition\ners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and\nWater Conservation Districts and a number of local and\nfederal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by\nknowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant\nto the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners\nretaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation\nof those false claims. Following this Court\u2019s review of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was\n\nargued. \n\n                       Cite as: 559 U.

WILSON \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n  We have examined the FCA\u2019s qui tam provisions in\nseveral recent opinions.3 At issue in this case is the FCA\u2019s\npublic disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction\nover qui tam suits when the relevant information has\nalready entered the public domain through certain chan\nnels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction\nstripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court\nof Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300\u2013301, we have inserted\nArabic numerals to identify these categories:\n       \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin\n       istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra\n       tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,\n       hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news\n       media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney\n       General or the person bringing the action is an origi\n       nal source[4] of the information.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (foot\n       note omitted).\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective \u201cad\nministrative\u201d in the second category (Category 2): whether\nit embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as\nrespondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures\nmade in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 See,\n         e.g., Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v.

S. 765 (2000)\n(holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions).\n   4 A separate statutory provision defines an \u201coriginal source\u201d as \u201can\n\nindividual who has direct and independent knowledge of the informa\ntion on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided\nthe information to the Government before filing an action under this\nsection which is based on the information.\u201d 31 U.

Although there is\nsome overlap among the three types of argument, it is\nuseful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.\n                              III\n    The term \u201cadministrative\u201d \u201cmay, in various contexts,\nbear a range of related meanings,\u201d Chandler v. Judicial\nCouncil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to\nprivate bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When\nused to modify the nouns \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\ntigation,\u201d in the context of a statutory provision about \u201cthe\npublic disclosure\u201d of fraud on the United States, the term\nis most naturally read to describe the activities of govern\nmental agencies. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cadministration,\u201d \u201c[i]n\npublic law, [as] the practical management and direction of\nthe executive department and its agencies\u201d). Given that\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by \u201cfederal,\u201d there is\nno immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the\nactivities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)\nfrom its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, \u201cthe\nstatute by its express terms does not limit its reach to\nfederal administrative reports or investigations.\u201d 528\nF. 3d, at 301. \u201c[T]here is nothing inherently federal about\nthe word \u2018administrative,\u2019 and Congress did not define the\nterm in the FCA.\u201d Id., at 302.\n    The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cadministrative\u201d\nnevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its\napplication of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.\nSee id., at 302\u2013305. This maxim, literally translated as\n\u201c \u2018it is known by its associates,\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s 1160, counsels\n6       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v.

United\nStates, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this\nlitigation acknowledge that the terms \u201ccongressional\u201d and\n\u201c[GAO]\u201d are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative\nBranch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a\nfederal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren\nCo. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.\n370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that \u201cthe three terms in\nCategory 2 are no more \u2018distinct\u2019 or \u2018disparate\u2019 than the phrase at issue\nin Jarecki.\u201d Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We\ndisagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase \u201ccon\ngressional, administrative, or GAO\u201d is not as cohesive as the phrase\n\u201cexploration, discovery, or prospecting.\u201d That is one reason why nosci\ntur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in\nthis case. On their \u201cface,\u201d the terms \u201cexploration,\u201d \u201cdiscovery,\u201d and\n\u201cprospecting\u201d all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;\nthe centrality of such activities to \u201cthe oil and gas and mining indus\ntries\u201d gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind\nwhen it drafted the provision. 367 U.

S., at 415; where they differ is in determining\nthe relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes\nthat Category 2 is the only piece of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) that\nmatters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of\nthe sources listed in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:\nspecifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui\ntam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar\u2019s gram\nmatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify\ning to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it\ndoes not follow that we should treat these categories as\nislands unto themselves. Courts have a \u201cduty to construe\nstatutes, not isolated provisions.\u201d Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).\n   When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure\nbar, the case for limiting \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\nsources becomes significantly weaker. The \u201cnews media\u201d\nreferenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.\nThe Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and\ncertain private outlets have a national focus; but no one\ncontends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.\nThere is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the\n\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\u201d listed in\nCategory 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201ccommon feature\u201d at all, post, at 4\u2014apart from a governmental conno\ntation.

Respondent\nand the Solicitor General assert that \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s two\nreferences to \u201cadministrative\u201d can be distinguished be\ncause Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudica\ntive proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to\nrefer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as\nrulemaking, oversight, and investigations.

See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324;\nBrief for United States 25\u201326. No court has ever taken\nsuch a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing\ncases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh\nCircuits and stating that \u201c[t]he courts have easily con\ncluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings\u201d);\nSylvia \u00a711:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The\narguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into\nCategory 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history\nand policy; they find no support in the statute\u2019s text.\n  Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to\na bird\u2019s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General\nalso maintain that the \u201cexclusively federal focus\u201d of the\nFCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to\nencompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10,\n18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has\na federal focus. But so does every other federal statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnarrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure\nstatus to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state\nand local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public\ndisclosure status to a formal public report of a state government\nagency\u201d).\n  10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent\n\nasserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.\nCalifornia, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and\nrejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.\nBrief for Respondent 23\u201324.

Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh\nCircuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and\nDunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on\nnotice of the possibility that \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal\nsources.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

In any event, the\n\u201cfederal focus\u201d of the statute, as a whole, does not shine\nlight on the specific question whether the public disclosure\nbar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of\n\u201cpublic disclosure\u201d\u2014not Federal Government creation or\nreceipt\u2014that is the touchstone of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A).\n   Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last\nargument grounded in the statutory text: It would be\nanomalous, they say, for state and local administrative\nreports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla\ntive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for\nUnited States 15\u201316. Yet neither respondent nor the\nSolicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners\nand their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar\nwas enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla\ntures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing\nfederally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36\u2013\n39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8\u201313. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern\nment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and\nto provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.\nWhether or not state legislative sources should have been\nincluded in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car\nries no clear implications for the status of state adminis\ntrative sources.\n   In sum, although the term \u201cadministrative\u201d may be\nsandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 On its face, \u00a73733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed\n\neral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it\ndoes, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil\ninvestigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.\nSee Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31\u201332.\n12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be\ntween phrases that have been generally understood to\ninclude nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in\nCategory 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of\nour inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the\nnoscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of\nAppeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with\nwhich \u201cadministrative\u201d keeps company in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\nendow it with an exclusively federal character.\n                             IV\n  As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources\nfrom which a relator could acquire the information to\nbring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U.

Congress apparently concluded\nthat a total bar on qui tam actions based on information\nalready in the Government\u2019s possession thwarted a sig\nnificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather\nthan simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how\never, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in\nan effort to strike a balance between encouraging private\npersons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits\nsuch as the one in Hess. How exactly \u00a73730(e)(4) came to\nstrike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid\nerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary\nCommittees each reported bills that contained very differ\nent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in\nthe Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not\n14    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

See S. Rep., at 42\u201343 (text of\nproposed \u00a73730(e)(4)).13\n   In respondent and her amici\u2019s view, this background\ncounsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of\n\u201cadministrative\u201d for three separate reasons. First, the\ndrafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that\nCongress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of\nthe 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov\nernment knowledge bar, and \u201c[c]onstruing [\u00a73730(e)(4)(A)]\nas limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers\nCongress\u2019s purpose \u2018to encourage more private enforce\nment suits.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,\nat 23\u201324). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed\nings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General\nwith a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA\naction based on revelations made therein, the Attorney\nGeneral is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in\nstate proceedings. Respondent and her amici further\nmaintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal\nsources in Category 2, as local governments would then be\nable to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis\ncretely disclosing evidence of fraud in \u201cpublic\u201d reports.14\n   These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but\nthey do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft\ning history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques\ntions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See   also H.

WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on\na remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill,\nSenator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for\nUnited States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and\nJustice as Amicus Curiae 13\u201314; Brief for Taxpayers\nAgainst Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30\u201331.\nIn a floor statement, Grassley said that \u201cthe term \u2018Gov\nernment\u2019 in the definition of original source is meant to\ninclude any Government source of disclosures cited in [the\npublic disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes\nCongress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or\nindependent agency as well as all other governmental\nbodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.\u201d\n132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence\nby a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful\nweight, Senator Grassley\u2019s remark merely begs the ques\ntion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether\nthe \u201cother governmental bodies\u201d may be state or local\nbodies. It also turns on a term, \u201cGovernment\u201d with a\ncapital \u201cG,\u201d that does not appear in the codified version of\nthe public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently\nrevised in numerous respects prior to passage.\n   There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record\nthat squarely corroborates respondent\u2019s reading of the\nstatute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986\namendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145\nCong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in\nwhich Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: \u201cWe did\nintend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm,\nthat the disclosure must be in a federal criminal, civil or\nadministrative hearing.

In our view, neither the general trajectory of 20th\ncentury FCA reform nor the specific statements made during the 1986\nlegislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question\nbefore us.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as\nlegislative \u201chistory,\u201d given that it was written 13 years\nafter the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of\nscant or no value for our purposes.17\n   We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986\namendments to the FCA \u201cto strengthen the Government\u2019s\nhand in fighting false claims,\u201d Cook County, 538 U. S., at\n133\u2013134, and \u201cto encourage more private enforcement\nsuits,\u201d S. Rep., at 23\u201324. It is equally beyond cavil, how\never, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar\na subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or\ndownright harmful. The question before us concerns the\nprecise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record\nis all but opaque. While \u201cthe absence of specific legislative\nhistory in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty\nto give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted\nin the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting\nthe law in question,\u201d United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 See Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447\n\nU. S. 102, 118 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.

See Brief\nfor Respondent 30\u201333; Brief for United States 14\u201315; Brief for Taxpay\ners Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28\u201329. Yet while\n\u201cthere is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in\ntandem with the FCA,\u201d Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the\nPFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no\nexplicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category\n2\u2019s reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d sources to the same set of agencies.\nThe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated\nin the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer\nence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are\naware, articulated any such intent.\n18    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n303, 310 (1976), there is no \u201cevident legislative purpose\u201d to\nguide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.\n                              V\n   Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their\ncase that petitioners\u2019 reading of the statute will lead to\nresults that Congress could not have intended. Their\nargument rests on an empirical proposition: \u201cWhile federal\ninquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De\npartment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and\nlocal reports and investigations never come to the atten\ntion of federal authorities.\u201d Brief for United States 22; see\nalso 528 F. 3d, at 306 (\u201cBecause the federal government is\nunlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a\nlarge number of fraudulent claims against the government\nwould go unremedied without the financial incentives\noffered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA\u201d). This\nproposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.\nNumerous federal investigations may be occurring at any\ngiven time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn\nabout their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about\nquite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the\ninquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state\nprogram financed in part by federal dollars, such as the\nprogram at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the\nAttorney General a typical state or local source will be, as\ncompared to a federal source, is an open question. And it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern\n\nments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See\n31 U.

C. \u00a77502(a)(1)(B) (requiring nonfederal entities that expend\nfederal awards above a certain amount to \u201cundergo a single audit\u201d in\naccordance with specified conditions); Brief for State of Pennsylvania et\nal. as Amici Curiae 7\u201310 (discussing the Single Audit Act of 1984). It\nbears mention that, to the extent one is worried about Federal Gov\nernment ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts, see post, at 10\u2013\n11, today\u2019s ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention\nto such efforts going forward.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The statutory touchstone,\nonce again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been\n\u201cpublic[ly] disclos[ed],\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), not whether they\nhave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument also gives insufficient weight to\nCongress\u2019 decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo\nsures \u201cfrom the news media.\u201d Ibid. Because there was no\nsuch bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a\njurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion\nthat the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded\nintent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.\nAnd since the \u201cnews media\u201d include a large number of\nlocal newspapers and radio stations, this category likely\ndescribes a multitude of sources that would seldom come\nto the attention of the Attorney General.\n   As for respondent and her amici\u2019s concern that local\ngovernments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil\nity \u201cthrough careful, low key \u2018disclosures\u2019 \u201d of potential\nfraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu\nlation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any\nsuch disclosure would not immunize the local government\nfrom FCA liability in an action brought by the United\nStates, see Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.\n457, 478 (2007)\u2014and to the contrary it could tip off the\nAttorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It\nseems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view\nwhen they assert that, \u201c[g]iven the fact that the submis\nsion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen\ndant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam\nages and attorneys\u2019 fees, no rational entity would prepare\na report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of\ncutting off qui tam actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;\nsee also United States ex rel.

Today\u2019s ruling merely confirms\nthat disclosures made in one type of context\u2014a state or\nlocal report, audit, or investigation\u2014may trigger the\npublic disclosure bar. It has no bearing on disclosures\nmade in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of\noriginal sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective\nof the state of Government knowledge.

Today, the\nCourt reads the phrase \u201cadministrative . . . report, hear\ning, audit, or investigation\u201d to encompass not only federal,\nbut also state and local, government sources.

As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is more capacious, potentially reaching\nnot only federal, state, and local government sources but\nalso disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \u201cadministrative\u201d as\n\u201cpertain[ing] to administration, especially management,\n. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or\nthings\u201d).\n    Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress\u2019 choice of two\n\u201cclearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed\neral term\u201d as a \u201cvery strong contextual cue about the\nmeaning of \u2018administrative.\u2019 \u201d 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4\n2008). \u201c \u2018The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an\ninescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is\ncapable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 As\n       the Court observes, in enacting \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone\nously referred to the General Accounting Office\u2014now renamed the\nGovernment Accountability Office\u2014as the \u201cGovernment Accounting\nOffice.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Here, the imme\ndiate proximity of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d suggests\nthat \u201cadministrative\u201d should be read, like its neighbors, as\nreferring to Federal Government sources.

But in my view, \u201ccongressional\u201d\nand \u201c[GAO]\u201d provide the better textual grounding for that\nconclusion. I see no reason why the \u201cadministrati[on]\u201d of a\nprivate university, for instance, could not issue a \u201creport,\u201d\norder an \u201caudit\u201d or \u201cinvestigation,\u201d or conduct a \u201chearing.\u201d\nNor, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, are private\nentities\u2014particularly those receiving federal funds or\nparticipating in federal programs\u2014incapable of making\n\u201cpublic disclosure[s]\u201d of fraud on the Federal Government.\n   Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court\nnevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of\nnoscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,\nconcluding that \u201c[a] list of three items, each quite distinct\nfrom the other no matter how construed, is too short to be\nparticularly illuminating.\u201d Ante, at 6\u20137. The three terms\nin Category 2, the Court concludes, are \u201ctoo few and too\ndisparate\u201d to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,\nat 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this\nway, and I would not do so here.\n   To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v.

S., at 304\u2013305 (quoting\n\u00a7456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz\ning that the word \u201c \u2018[d]iscovery\u2019 \u201d is \u201cusable in many con\ntexts and with various shades of meaning,\u201d we observed\nthat it \u201cgathers meaning from the words around it\u201d and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all\ndescribe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and\nmining industries.\u201d Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of\nother contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,\nwe held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera\nequipment did not give rise to \u201cabnormal income\u201d even if\nsuch inventions might otherwise be understood as \u201cdis\ncover[ies].\u201d See id., at 307\u2013313. In my view, the three\nterms in Category 2 are no more \u201cdistinct\u201d or \u201cdisparate,\u201d\nante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly\ngiven the expansive plain meaning of \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Cf.\nante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis\nprinciple readily yields a common feature: The sources at\nissue are federal in nature, not related to state or local\ngovernments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in\nNashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U.

There is\nno conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re\nspondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively\nfederal. See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 25\u201326. Even reading Category 1\nmore broadly, however, does not change the exclusively\nfederal nature of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d which\nundermines whatever inference might be drawn from\ntaking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating\nthe entirety of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of\nitems gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress\nmade in offsetting each category with commas and prepo\nsitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that\nmodify different nouns.\n   Finally, the Court also views \u201cnews media\u201d as \u201cdistinctly\nnonfederal in nature.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. But \u201cnews media\u201d\ndoes not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As\nthe Court of Appeals observed, although media sources\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings\u201d). Because Congress did not\nemploy a completely disjunctive list in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2014i.e., \u201ccongres\nsional or administrative or [GAO]\u201d\u2014the Reiter principle applies with\nless force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 73 (1984) (applying\ndisjunctive principle in construing statutory prohibition on assault and\nrobbery of any custodian of \u201c \u2018mail matter or of any money or other\nproperty of the United States,\u2019 \u201d and observing that \u201c[t]he three classes\nof property . . . are each separated by the conjunction \u2018or\u2019 \u201d (quoting 18\nU.

While the legislative record\nis concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise\ncaution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi\nble meaning\u2014i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also\nstate and local, government sources.\n    Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the\n1986 amendments, the \u201cGovernment knowledge\u201d bar\nunquestionably referred only to information in the posses\nsion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was\ncriticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an\ninitial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de\nscribed the FCA\u2019s history and need for legislative reform,\nnoting \u201cseveral restrictive court interpretations of the act\n. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.\u201d\nS.

The Senate Report also articulated a desire\nto \u201cencourage any individual knowing of Government\nfraud to bring that information forward,\u201d and it identified\nas \u201cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective\nenforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the\npart of Federal enforcement agencies.\u201d S. Rep., at 2, 7.6\n  Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted\nlegislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfrom bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had\npreviously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even\nwhen the State\u2019s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,\nat 12\u201313. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was\ncontroversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the\n\u201coriginal source\u201d exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar.

Today\u2019s decision risks such a\nresult. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by\nall appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the\npre-1986 regime. Construing \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) to encompass\nthe thousands of state and local government administra\ntive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the\nFederal Government knowledge of such sources, whether\nor not the Government is aware of the information or in a\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In  June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill\nthat would have barred qui tam actions based on information \u201cwhich\nthe Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior\nadministrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,\u201d \u201cdisclosed during the\ncourse of a congressional investigation,\u201d or \u201cdisseminated by any news\nmedia.\u201d H.

The references to information disclosed by the Government\nitself (with a capital \u201cG\u201d) and to \u201ccongressional investigation[s]\u201d connote\nfederal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring\nactions \u201cbased upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of\na civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six\nmonths of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega\ntions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a\ncongressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or\nfrom the news media.\u201d S.

The enacted legislation did differ in several\nrespects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record\ncontains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government\nsources.

But neither the Court nor the amici rebut\nthe Solicitor General\u2019s pragmatic observation that \u201cthe vague and\nsummary nature of many of those reports . . . does not . . . alert the\nfederal government of fraud.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n31.\n12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nquences of a more expansive interpretation together sug\ngest Category 2 is most reasonably read to encompass\nfederal, but not state or local, government sources.11\n                       *    *     *\n For the reasons given above, I would affirm the judg\nment of the Court of Appeals, and respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The majority notes in passing several policy arguments advanced\n\nby petitioners and their amici. Ante, at 20, n. 19. None merits much\nweight. Petitioners are concerned about a race to the courthouse, in\nwhich parasitic relators will capitalize on information released in a\nstate or local government report to the disadvantage of a slow-moving\ninsider. Brief for Petitioners 31. But the FCA\u2019s first-to-file provision,\n31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(5), reflects Congress\u2019 explicit policy choice to\nencourage prompt filing and, in turn, prompt recovery of defrauded\nfunds by the United States. Amici States are concerned that relators\nmay interfere with ongoing state and local government investigations\nby \u201ctrolling state records and reports\u201d for evidence of fraud. States\nBrief 11. But some state freedom-of-information laws exempt materials\nrelated to ongoing civil investigations. See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a745\u2013\n221(a)(11) (2008 Cum. Supp.); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, \u00a767.708(b)(17)\n(Purdon Supp. 2009). In any event, the FCA contains no provision\ngiving state or local governments a privileged position as qui tam\nrelators or, with respect to local governments, defendants.\n</pre>",
