ESPINOSA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u20131134. Argued December 1, 2009\u2014Decided March 23, 2010\nA plan proposed under Bankruptcy Code (Code) Chapter 13 becomes\n  effective upon confirmation, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, and will re\n  sult in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor com\n  pletes the payments the plan requires, see \u00a71328(a). A debtor may\n  obtain a discharge of government-sponsored student loan debts only\n  if failure to discharge that debt would impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on\n  the debtor and his dependents. \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8); 1328. Bankruptcy courts\n  must make this undue hardship determination in an adversary pro\n  ceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001(6), which the party seeking\n  the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint\n  on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008. Respondent Espinosa\u2019s\n  plan proposed repaying the principal on his student loan debt and\n  discharging the interest once the principal was repaid, but he did not\n  initiate the required adversary proceeding. The student loan credi\n  tor, petitioner United, received notice of the plan from the Bank\n  ruptcy Court and did not object to the plan or to Espinosa\u2019s failure to\n  initiate the required proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed\n  the plan without holding such a proceeding or making a finding of\n  undue hardship. Once Espinosa paid his student loan principal, the\n  court discharged the interest. A few years later, the Department of\n  Education sought to collect that interest. In response, Espinosa\n  asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the\n  Department and United to cease any collection efforts. United op\n  posed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation or\n  der because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosa\u2019s\n  student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bank\n  ruptcy Rules, and because United\u2019s due process rights were violated\n2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and\n    complaint.    Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court\n    granted Espinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part and denied the cross\n    motion. The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied\n    due process when the confirmation order was issued without the re\n    quired service. The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed. It concluded\n    that by confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue hard\n    ship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most\n    committed a legal error that United might have successfully ap\n    pealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as\n    void under Rule 60(b)(4). It also held that Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve\n    United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void be\n    cause United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.\nHeld:\n    1. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is not void under\n Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) That order was a final judgment from which United did not\n appeal. Such finality ordinarily would \u201cstan[d] in the way of chal\n lenging [the order\u2019s] enforceability,\u201d Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bai\n ley, 557 U. S. ___, ___. However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek\n relief from a final judgment that \u201cis void,\u201d but only in the rare in\n stance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of ju\n risdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a\n party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. United\u2019s alleged error\n falls in neither category. Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had\n jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the\n judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of\n Espinosa\u2019s proposed discharge. Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve the sum\n mons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived\n United of a right granted by a procedural rule. United could have\n timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse rul\n ing on its objection. But this deprivation did not amount to a viola\n tion of due process, which requires notice \u201creasonably calculated, un\n der all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the\n pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present\n their objections,\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\n U. S. 306, 314. Here, United\u2019s actual notice of the filing and contents\n of Espinosa\u2019s plan more than satisfied its due process rights. Thus,\n Espinosa\u2019s failure to make the required service does not entitle\n United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Contrary to United\u2019s claim, the confirmation order is not void\n because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm\n Espinosa\u2019s plan absent an undue hardship finding under \u00a7523(a)(8).\n Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Section\n  523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over student\n  loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a\n  denial of due process. Instead, it requires a court to make a certain\n  findings before confirming a student loan debt\u2019s discharge. \u2018That this\n  requirement is \u201c \u2018self-executing,\u2019 \u201d Tennessee Student Assistance Cor\n  poration v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy\n  court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does\n  not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to\n  make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for\n  Rule 60(b)(4) purposes. Although the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s failure to\n  find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is en\n  forceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the\n  error and failed to object or timely appeal. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     2. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must\n  confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without\n  an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless\n  the creditor timely raises a specific objection. A Chapter 13 plan pro\n  posing such a discharge without the required determination violates\n  \u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this self-executing\n  requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to\n  object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court\n  may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the \u201capplica\n  ble provisions\u201d of the Code. \u00a71325(a). Neither the Code nor the Rules\n  prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue\n  hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons\n  and complaint. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     3. Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an ap\n  propriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from fil\n  ing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship\n  requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the\n  proposal and the creditor will not object. Such bad-faith efforts\n  should be deterred by the specter of penalties that \u201c[d]ebtors and\n  their attorneys face . . . under various provisions for engaging in im\n  proper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d Taylor v. Freeland &\n  Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 644. And Congress may enact additional provi\n  sions to address any difficulties should existing sanctions prove in\n  adequate.

ESPINOSA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 23, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (Code), a\ndebtor may obtain a discharge of certain government\u00ad\nsponsored student loan debts only if failure to discharge\nthat debt would impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the debtor\nand his dependents. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8), 1328. The\nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination\nin an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the\nparty seeking the determination must initiate by serving a\nsummons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003,\n7004, 7008. The debtor in this case filed a plan with the\nBankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of\nhis student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adver\u00ad\nsary proceeding as required for such discharge. The credi\u00ad\ntor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and\nfailed to file an appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subse\u00ad\nquently confirmed the plan. Years later, the creditor filed\na motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)\nasking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order con\u00ad\nfirming the plan was void because the order was issued in\n2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation of the Code and Rules. We granted certiorari to\nresolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to\nwhether an order that confirms the discharge of a student\nloan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or\nan adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for\nRule 60(b)(4) purposes.\n                              I\n  Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa\nobtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a\ntotal principal amount of $13,250. In 1992, Espinosa filed\na bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. That Chapter\npermits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or\na portion of their debts over a period of time specified in\nthe plan. See Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 508\nU. S. 324, 327 (1993); see also \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan be\u00ad\ncomes effective upon confirmation, see \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, and\nwill result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if\nthe debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see\n\u00a71328(a).\n  Espinosa\u2019s plan listed his student loan debt as his only\nspecific indebtedness. App. 15\u201318. The plan proposed to\nrepay only the principal on that debt, stating that the\nremainder\u2014the accrued interest\u2014would be discharged\nonce Espinosa repaid the principal. Id., at 26.\n  As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require,\nthe clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a\ncopy of Espinosa\u2019s plan to petitioner United Student Aid\nFunds, Inc. (United), the creditor to whom Espinosa owed\nthe student loan debt.1 Id., at 34; see Rules 2002(b), (g)(2),\n3015(d). In boldface type immediately below the caption,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 United\n           is a guaranty agency that administers the collection of feder\u00ad\nally guaranteed student loans in accordance with regulations promul\u00ad\ngated by the United States Department of Education. See, e.g., 34 CFR\n\u00a7682.200 et seq. (2009).\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plan stated: \u201cWARNING IF YOU ARE A CREDITOR\nYOUR RIGHTS MAY BE IMPAIRED BY THIS PLAN.\u201d\nId., at 23. The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a\nproof of claim or an objection to the plan. Id., at 26\u201327.\n  United received this notice and, in response, filed a\nproof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both\nthe principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa\u2019s stu\u00ad\ndent loans. Id., at 35. United did not object to the plan\u2019s\nproposed discharge of Espinosa\u2019s student loan interest\nwithout a determination of undue hardship, nor did it\nobject to Espinosa\u2019s failure to initiate an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.\n  In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed\nEspinosa\u2019s plan without holding an adversary proceeding\nor making a finding of undue hardship. One month later,\nthe Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stat\u00ad\ning that \u201c[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the\namount listed for payment in the plan\u201d and that \u201c[y]our\nclaim will be paid as listed in the plan.\u201d Id., at 44. The\nform also apprised United that if United \u201cwishe[d] to\ndispute the above stated treatment of the claim,\u201d it had\nthe \u201cresponsibility\u201d to notify the trustee within 30 days.\nIbid. United did not respond to that notice.\n  In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his\nstudent loan principal, as required by the plan. Shortly\nthereafter, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa\u2019s\nstudent loan interest.2\n  In 2000, the United States Department of Education\ncommenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espi\u00ad\nnosa\u2019s student loans.3 In response, Espinosa filed a mo\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The discharge order contained an apparent clerical error that the\n\ncourts below considered and addressed in adjudicating these proceed\u00ad\nings. See n. 4, infra.\n  3 After Espinosa completed payments under the plan, United as\u00ad\n\nsigned Espinosa\u2019s loans to the Department under a reinsurance agree\u00ad\nment. After these proceedings began, United requested and received a\n4       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its\n1997 discharge order by directing the Department and\nUnited to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on\nhis student loan debt.\n   United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to\nset aside as void the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s 1993 order con\u00ad\nfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan. United made two arguments in\nsupport of its motion. First, United claimed that the\nprovision of Espinosa\u2019s plan authorizing the discharge of\nhis student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code,\nwhich requires a court to find undue hardship before\ndischarging a student loan debt, \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8), 1328(a), and\nwith the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to\nmake the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceed\u00ad\ning, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due\nprocess rights had been violated because Espinosa failed\nto serve it with the summons and complaint the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial\nproceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.\n   The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted\nEspinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part, denied United\u2019s cross\u00ad\nmotion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their\ncollection efforts. United sought review in the District\nCourt, which reversed. That court held that United was\ndenied due process because the confirmation order was\nissued without service of the summons and complaint the\nBankruptcy Rules require.\n   Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, which issued an initial per curiam opinion re\u00ad\nmanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider\ncorrecting an apparent clerical error in its discharge or\u00ad\nder.4 530 F. 3d 895, 899 (2008). The Bankruptcy Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrecall of the loans from the Department. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63.\n  4 The one-page discharge order contained a paragraph that purported\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrected the error, after which the Court of Appeals\nresubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue\nhardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy\nCourt at most committed a legal error that United might\nhave successfully appealed, but that any such legal error\nwas not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as\nvoid under Rule 60(b). 553 F. 3d 1193, 1198\u20131202 (2008).5\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals held that although\nEspinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons and\ncomplaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan\ndebt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service\nwas not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void\nbecause United received actual notice of Espinosa\u2019s plan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto exclude \u201c \u2018any debt . . . for a student loan\u2019 \u201d from the discharge. 530 \n\nF. 3d 895, 896 (CA9 2008). That provision appeared irreconcilable with\nthe confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the inter\u00ad\nest on Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy\nCourt may have automatically generated the discharge order without\ntailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals\nremanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the\ndischarge order to conform to the confirmation order. Id., at 899; see\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to \u201ccorrect a clerical\nmistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission\u201d). On remand,\nthe Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order except\u00ad\ning Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt from discharge \u201cwas inserted because\nof a clerical mistake\u201d and struck that language from the order. App. 48.\n   Although certain amici press the point, United has not challenged\nthe substance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s amendment to the order or\nasked us to consider whether such amendment was proper under Rule\n60(a). See Brief for Petitioner 42; Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. Thus,\nwe express no view on those issues. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial\nServices, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991) (noting that \u201cwe do not\nordinarily address issues raised only by amici\u201d).\n   5 In so doing, the Court of Appeals disagreed with two other Courts of\n\nAppeals. See In re Mersmann, 505 F. 3d 1033, 1047\u20131049 (CA10 2007)\n(en banc); Whelton v. Educational Credit Management Corp., 432 F. 3d\n150, 154 (CA2 2005).\n6         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

Although the term \u201cvoid\u201d describes a result, rather\nthan the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable,\nit suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by\na fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised\neven after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally id., \u00a712.\nThe list of such infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise,\nRule 60(b)(4)\u2019s exception to finality would swallow the\nrule.\n   \u201cA judgment is not void,\u201d for example, \u201csimply because it\nis or may have been erroneous.\u201d Hoult v.

Instead, Rule 60(b)(4)\napplies only in the rare instance where a judgment is\npremised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or\non a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice\nor the opportunity to be heard.

We need not settle that question,\nhowever, because the parties did not raise it in the courts below. And\neven under a theory that would treat United\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion as a\n\u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d the plan, United\u2019s failure to file its motion within\n\u00a71330(a)\u2019s 180-day deadline and its failure to seek relief on the basis of\nfraud did not deprive those courts\u2014and does not deprive us\u2014of author\u00ad\nity to consider the motion on the merits because those limitations are\nnot jurisdictional.

Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 5, 11. Such an argument would fail in any\nevent. First, \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s statutory requirement that a\nbankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging\na student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a dis\u00ad\ncharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 515\u2013516 (2006). Second, the requirement that a\nbankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule Proc.\n7001(6), which are \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the Court\nfor the orderly transaction of its business\u201d that are \u201cnot\njurisdictional.\u201d Kontrick v.

Specifically, United argues that the\nBankruptcy Court violated United\u2019s due process rights by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan despite Espinosa\u2019s failure to\nserve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules\nrequire for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.\nWe disagree.\n     Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons\nand complaint deprived United of a right granted by a\nprocedural rule. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3).\nUnited could have timely objected to this deprivation and\nappealed from an adverse ruling on its objection. But this\ndeprivation did not amount to a violation of United\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process. Due process requires\nnotice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,\nto apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action\nand afford them an opportunity to present their objec\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Mullane v.

Here, United received actual notice of the\nfiling and contents of Espinosa\u2019s plan. This more than\nsatisfied United\u2019s due process rights. Accordingly, on\nthese facts, Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve a summons and\ncomplaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule\n60(b)(4).\n                            B\n     Unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Specifically, they contend\nthat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is void\nbecause the court lacked statutory authority to confirm\nEspinosa\u2019s plan absent a finding of undue hardship. In\nsupport of this contention, they cite the text of \u00a7523(a)(8),\nwhich provides that student loan debts guaranteed by\ngovernmental units are not dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a court\nfinds undue hardship. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(8) (emphasis\nadded). They argue that this language imposes a \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting\u2019 limitation on the effect of a discharge order\u201d\nthat renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus\nvoid, if it is not satisfied.

In addition, United cites \u00a71325(a)(1), which\ninstructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans\nthat comply with \u201cthe . . . applicable provisions\u201d of the\nCode. Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues\nthat an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge\na student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is\n\u201cdoubly beyond the court\u2019s authority and therefore void.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 13.\n   We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hard\u00ad\nship in accordance with \u00a7523(a)(8) is on par with the\njurisdictional and notice failings that define void judg\u00ad\nments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4). As\nnoted, \u00a7523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction over student loan debts.10 Supra, at 9\u201310; see\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Sections 1328(a) and 523(a)(8) provide that student loan debt is\n\ndischargeable in a Chapter 13 proceeding if a court makes a finding of\nundue hardship. In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide\nthat certain other debts are not dischargeable under any circumstances.\nSee, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); \u00a7523(a)(5) (domestic\nsupport obligations); \u00a7523(a)(9) (debts \u201ccaused by\u201d the debtor\u2019s unlawful\n12       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nHood, 541 U. S., at 447 (noting that \u201c[b]ankruptcy courts\nhave exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor\u2019s property\u201d). Nor\ndoes the provision impose requirements that, if violated,\nwould result in a denial of due process. Instead, \u00a7523(a)(8)\nrequires a court to make a certain finding before confirm\u00ad\ning the discharge of a student loan debt. It is true, as we\nexplained in Hood, that this requirement is \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 450.11 But that means only that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\noperation of a vehicle while intoxicated). We express no view on the\nconditions under which an order confirming the discharge of one of\nthese types of debt could be set aside as void.\n    11 The Government suggests that \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s \u201cself-executing\u201d nature\n\nderives in part from the text of \u00a7523(a), which states that \u201c[a] discharge\nunder section 727 . . . or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an\nindividual debtor from any debt,\u201d including the student loan debts\nspecified in paragraph (8) (emphasis added); see Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 18; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 1\u20132. That is\nnot what we concluded in Hood and, in this case, would be irrelevant in\nany event.\n    In Hood, we described as \u201c \u2018self-executing\u2019 \u201d paragraph (8)\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntion that student loan debt not be discharged \u201cunless\u201d an undue hard\u00ad\nship determination is made. 541 U.

The \u201cdoes not dis\u00ad\ncharge\u201d language in \u00a7523(a), which applies generally to every\nenumerated paragraph in that section\u2014and to which we never referred\nin Hood\u2014was not relevant to our analysis. That is evident from the\nauthority we cited to support our description of \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s condition as\n\u201c \u2018self-executing.\u2019 \u201d E.g., id., at 450 (citing S. Rep.

See Part III, infra. But\nthe order remains enforceable and binding on United\nbecause United had notice of the error and failed to object\nor timely appeal.\n   United\u2019s response\u2014that it had no obligation to object to\nEspinosa\u2019s plan until Espinosa served it with the sum\u00ad\nmons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require, Brief\nfor Petitioner 33\u2014is unavailing. Rule 60(b)(4) does not\nprovide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.\nUnited had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa\u2019s plan,\nits contents, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s subsequent\nconfirmation of the plan. In addition, United filed a proof\nof claim regarding Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt, thereby\nsubmitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction\nwith respect to that claim. See Langenkamp v. Culp, 498\nU. S. 42, 44 (1990) (per curiam). United therefore forfeited\nits arguments regarding the validity of service or the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsis added). Section 1328(a) thus incorporates by reference paragraph\n(8) of \u00a7523(a), including that paragraph\u2019s self-executing requirement for\nan undue hardship determination, but does not incorporate the \u201cdoes\nnot discharge\u201d text of \u00a7523(a) itself.\n  12 United relies on our decisions in United States ex rel.

ESPINOSA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s procedures by failing\nto raise a timely objection in that court.\n   Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for\nfinality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that\nlitigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a\ndispute. Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan\u2019s\ncontents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan\nbefore the time for appeal expires, that party has been\nafforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the\nparty\u2019s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not\njustify Rule 60(b)(4) relief. We thus agree with the Court\nof Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order\nis not void.\n                            III\n  In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals\nlooked beyond the narrow question whether the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan was void\nunder Rule 60(b)(4). It canvassed other bankruptcy court\ndecisions within the Circuit that presented a different\nquestion\u2014whether a bankruptcy court presented with a\ndebtor\u2019s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan\ndebt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to deter\u00ad\nmine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its\nfailure to comply with the Code and Rules. The Court of\nAppeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined\nto confirm such plans \u201ceven when the creditor fail[ed] to\nobject to the plan.\u201d 553 F. 3d, at 1205. The court disap\u00ad\nproved that practice and overruled those cases, stating\nthat bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the\ndischarge of a student loan debt without a determination\nof undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the\ncreditor timely raises a specific objection.

Failure to comply with this\nself-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of\nthe plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in\nthe proceeding at all. See Hood, 541 U. S., at 450.13 That\nis because \u00a71325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to con\u00ad\nfirm a plan only if the court finds, inter alia, that the plan\ncomplies with the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the Code.\n\u00a71325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court \u201cshall confirm\na plan\u201d if the plan \u201ccomplies with the provisions of\u201d Chap\u00ad\nter 13 and with \u201cother applicable provisions of this title\u201d);\nsee Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S. 78, 87 (1991);\nsee also \u00a7105(a) (authorizing bankruptcy courts to issue\n\u201cany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or\nappropriate to carry out\u201d the Code\u2019s provisions).14 Thus,\ncontrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 assertion, the Code\nmakes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority\u2014\nindeed, the obligation\u2014to direct a debtor to conform his\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 This is essential to preserve the distinction between Congress\u2019\n\ntreatment of student loan debts in \u00a7523(a)(8) and debts listed elsewhere\nin \u00a7523. Section 523(a)(8) renders student loan debt presumptively\nnondischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a determination of undue hardship is made.\nIn contrast, the debts listed in \u00a7523(c), which include certain debts\nobtained by fraud or \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor,\u201d\n\u00a7523(a)(6), are presumptively dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d the creditor\nrequests a hearing to determine the debt\u2019s dischargeability. The Court\nof Appeals\u2019 approach would subject student loan debt to the same rules\nas the debts specified in \u00a7523(c), notwithstanding the evident differ\u00ad\nences in the statutory framework for discharging the two types of debt.\n   14 In other contexts, we have held that courts have the discretion, but\n\nnot the obligation, to raise on their own initiative certain nonjurisdic\u00ad\ntional barriers to suit. See Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202, 209\n(2006) (statute of limitations); Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 134\n(1987) (habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s exhaustion of state remedies).\nSection 1325(a) does more than codify this principle; it requires bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to address and correct a defect in a debtor\u2019s proposed plan\neven if no creditor raises the issue.\n16      UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nplan to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).15\n  We are mindful that conserving assets is an important\nconcern in a bankruptcy proceeding. We thus assume\nthat, in some cases, a debtor and creditor may agree that\npayment of a student loan debt will cause the debtor an\nundue hardship sufficient to justify discharge. In such a\ncase, there is no reason that compliance with the undue\nhardship requirement should impose significant costs on\nthe parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.\nNeither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from\nstipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and\nneither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a\nsummons and complaint. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc.\n7004; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k). But, to comply with\n\u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an\nindependent determination of undue hardship before a\nplan is confirmed, even if the creditor fails to object or\nappear in the adversary proceeding. See supra, at 12.\n                            IV\n  United argues that our failure to declare the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order void will encourage unscrupulous\ndebtors to abuse the Chapter 13 process by filing plans\nproposing to dispense with the undue hardship require\u00ad\nment in the hopes the bankruptcy court will overlook the\nproposal and the creditor will not object. In the event the\nobjectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the\ndebtor can withdraw the plan and file another without\npenalty.\n  We acknowledge the potential for bad-faith litigation\ntactics. But expanding the availability of relief under Rule\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Bankruptcy courts appear to be well aware of this statutory obliga\u00ad\n\ntion. See, e.g., In re Mammel, 221 B. R. 238, 239 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Iowa\n1998) (\u201c[W]hether or not an objection is presently lodged in this case,\nthe Court retains the authority to review this plan and deny confirma\u00ad\ntion if it fails to comply with the confirmation standards of the Code\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Argued December 1, 2009\u2014Decided March 23, 2010\nA plan proposed under Bankruptcy Code (Code) Chapter 13 becomes\n  effective upon confirmation, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, and will re\n  sult in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor com\n  pletes the payments the plan requires, see \u00a71328(a). A debtor may\n  obtain a discharge of government-sponsored student loan debts only\n  if failure to discharge that debt would impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on\n  the debtor and his dependents. \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8); 1328. Bankruptcy courts\n  must make this undue hardship determination in an adversary pro\n  ceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7001(6), which the party seeking\n  the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint\n  on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008. Respondent Espinosa\u2019s\n  plan proposed repaying the principal on his student loan debt and\n  discharging the interest once the principal was repaid, but he did not\n  initiate the required adversary proceeding. The student loan credi\n  tor, petitioner United, received notice of the plan from the Bank\n  ruptcy Court and did not object to the plan or to Espinosa\u2019s failure to\n  initiate the required proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed\n  the plan without holding such a proceeding or making a finding of\n  undue hardship. Once Espinosa paid his student loan principal, the\n  court discharged the interest. A few years later, the Department of\n  Education sought to collect that interest. In response, Espinosa\n  asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the\n  Department and United to cease any collection efforts. United op\n  posed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation or\n  der because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosa\u2019s\n  student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bank\n  ruptcy Rules, and because United\u2019s due process rights were violated\n2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and\n    complaint.    Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court\n    granted Espinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part and denied the cross\n    motion. The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied\n    due process when the confirmation order was issued without the re\n    quired service. The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed. It concluded\n    that by confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue hard\n    ship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most\n    committed a legal error that United might have successfully ap\n    pealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as\n    void under Rule 60(b)(4). It also held that Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve\n    United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void be\n    cause United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.\nHeld:\n    1. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is not void under\n Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) That order was a final judgment from which United did not\n appeal. Such finality ordinarily would \u201cstan[d] in the way of chal\n lenging [the order\u2019s] enforceability,\u201d Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bai\n ley, 557 U. S. ___, ___. However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek\n relief from a final judgment that \u201cis void,\u201d but only in the rare in\n stance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of ju\n risdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a\n party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. United\u2019s alleged error\n falls in neither category. Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had\n jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the\n judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of\n Espinosa\u2019s proposed discharge. Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve the sum\n mons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived\n United of a right granted by a procedural rule. United could have\n timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse rul\n ing on its objection. But this deprivation did not amount to a viola\n tion of due process, which requires notice \u201creasonably calculated, un\n der all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the\n pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present\n their objections,\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\n U. S. 306, 314. Here, United\u2019s actual notice of the filing and contents\n of Espinosa\u2019s plan more than satisfied its due process rights. Thus,\n Espinosa\u2019s failure to make the required service does not entitle\n United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Contrary to United\u2019s claim, the confirmation order is not void\n because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm\n Espinosa\u2019s plan absent an undue hardship finding under \u00a7523(a)(8).\n Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Section\n  523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over student\n  loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a\n  denial of due process. Instead, it requires a court to make a certain\n  findings before confirming a student loan debt\u2019s discharge. \u2018That this\n  requirement is \u201c \u2018self-executing,\u2019 \u201d Tennessee Student Assistance Cor\n  poration v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy\n  court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does\n  not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to\n  make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for\n  Rule 60(b)(4) purposes. Although the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s failure to\n  find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is en\n  forceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the\n  error and failed to object or timely appeal. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     2. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must\n  confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without\n  an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless\n  the creditor timely raises a specific objection. A Chapter 13 plan pro\n  posing such a discharge without the required determination violates\n  \u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this self-executing\n  requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to\n  object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court\n  may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the \u201capplica\n  ble provisions\u201d of the Code. \u00a71325(a). Neither the Code nor the Rules\n  prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue\n  hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons\n  and complaint. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     3. Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an ap\n  propriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from fil\n  ing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship\n  requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the\n  proposal and the creditor will not object. Such bad-faith efforts\n  should be deterred by the specter of penalties that \u201c[d]ebtors and\n  their attorneys face . . . under various provisions for engaging in im\n  proper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d Taylor v.

The\nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination\nin an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the\nparty seeking the determination must initiate by serving a\nsummons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003,\n7004, 7008. The debtor in this case filed a plan with the\nBankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of\nhis student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adver\u00ad\nsary proceeding as required for such discharge. The credi\u00ad\ntor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and\nfailed to file an appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subse\u00ad\nquently confirmed the plan. Years later, the creditor filed\na motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)\nasking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order con\u00ad\nfirming the plan was void because the order was issued in\n2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation of the Code and Rules. We granted certiorari to\nresolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to\nwhether an order that confirms the discharge of a student\nloan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or\nan adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for\nRule 60(b)(4) purposes.\n                              I\n  Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa\nobtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a\ntotal principal amount of $13,250. In 1992, Espinosa filed\na bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. That Chapter\npermits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or\na portion of their debts over a period of time specified in\nthe plan. See Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 508\nU. S. 324, 327 (1993); see also \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan be\u00ad\ncomes effective upon confirmation, see \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, and\nwill result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if\nthe debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see\n\u00a71328(a).\n  Espinosa\u2019s plan listed his student loan debt as his only\nspecific indebtedness. App. 15\u201318. The plan proposed to\nrepay only the principal on that debt, stating that the\nremainder\u2014the accrued interest\u2014would be discharged\nonce Espinosa repaid the principal.

The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a\nproof of claim or an objection to the plan. Id., at 26\u201327.\n  United received this notice and, in response, filed a\nproof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both\nthe principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa\u2019s stu\u00ad\ndent loans. Id., at 35. United did not object to the plan\u2019s\nproposed discharge of Espinosa\u2019s student loan interest\nwithout a determination of undue hardship, nor did it\nobject to Espinosa\u2019s failure to initiate an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.\n  In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed\nEspinosa\u2019s plan without holding an adversary proceeding\nor making a finding of undue hardship. One month later,\nthe Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stat\u00ad\ning that \u201c[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the\namount listed for payment in the plan\u201d and that \u201c[y]our\nclaim will be paid as listed in the plan.\u201d Id., at 44. The\nform also apprised United that if United \u201cwishe[d] to\ndispute the above stated treatment of the claim,\u201d it had\nthe \u201cresponsibility\u201d to notify the trustee within 30 days.\nIbid. United did not respond to that notice.\n  In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his\nstudent loan principal, as required by the plan. Shortly\nthereafter, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa\u2019s\nstudent loan interest.2\n  In 2000, the United States Department of Education\ncommenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espi\u00ad\nnosa\u2019s student loans.3 In response, Espinosa filed a mo\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The discharge order contained an apparent clerical error that the\n\ncourts below considered and addressed in adjudicating these proceed\u00ad\nings. See n. 4, infra.\n  3 After Espinosa completed payments under the plan, United as\u00ad\n\nsigned Espinosa\u2019s loans to the Department under a reinsurance agree\u00ad\nment. After these proceedings began, United requested and received a\n4       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its\n1997 discharge order by directing the Department and\nUnited to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on\nhis student loan debt.\n   United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to\nset aside as void the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s 1993 order con\u00ad\nfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan. United made two arguments in\nsupport of its motion. First, United claimed that the\nprovision of Espinosa\u2019s plan authorizing the discharge of\nhis student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code,\nwhich requires a court to find undue hardship before\ndischarging a student loan debt, \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8), 1328(a), and\nwith the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to\nmake the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceed\u00ad\ning, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due\nprocess rights had been violated because Espinosa failed\nto serve it with the summons and complaint the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial\nproceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.\n   The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted\nEspinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part, denied United\u2019s cross\u00ad\nmotion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their\ncollection efforts. United sought review in the District\nCourt, which reversed. That court held that United was\ndenied due process because the confirmation order was\nissued without service of the summons and complaint the\nBankruptcy Rules require.\n   Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, which issued an initial per curiam opinion re\u00ad\nmanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider\ncorrecting an apparent clerical error in its discharge or\u00ad\nder.4 530 F. 3d 895, 899 (2008).

The Court of Appeals concluded that by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue\nhardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy\nCourt at most committed a legal error that United might\nhave successfully appealed, but that any such legal error\nwas not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as\nvoid under Rule 60(b). 553 F. 3d 1193, 1198\u20131202 (2008).5\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals held that although\nEspinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons and\ncomplaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan\ndebt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service\nwas not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void\nbecause United received actual notice of Espinosa\u2019s plan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto exclude \u201c \u2018any debt . . . for a student loan\u2019 \u201d from the discharge. 530 \n\nF. 3d 895, 896 (CA9 2008). That provision appeared irreconcilable with\nthe confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the inter\u00ad\nest on Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy\nCourt may have automatically generated the discharge order without\ntailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals\nremanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the\ndischarge order to conform to the confirmation order. Id., at 899; see\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to \u201ccorrect a clerical\nmistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission\u201d). On remand,\nthe Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order except\u00ad\ning Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt from discharge \u201cwas inserted because\nof a clerical mistake\u201d and struck that language from the order. App. 48.\n   Although certain amici press the point, United has not challenged\nthe substance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s amendment to the order or\nasked us to consider whether such amendment was proper under Rule\n60(a). See Brief for Petitioner 42; Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. Thus,\nwe express no view on those issues. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial\nServices, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991) (noting that \u201cwe do not\nordinarily address issues raised only by amici\u201d).\n   5 In so doing, the Court of Appeals disagreed with two other Courts of\n\nAppeals. See In re Mersmann, 505 F. 3d 1033, 1047\u20131049 (CA10 2007)\n(en banc); Whelton v. Educational Credit Management Corp., 432 F. 3d\n150, 154 (CA2 2005).\n6         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

As relevant here,\n\u00a71328(a) provides that when a debtor has completed the\nrepayments required by a confirmed plan, a bankruptcy\ncourt \u201cshall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts pro\u00ad\nvided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of\nthis title, except,\u201d inter alia, \u201cany debt . . . of the kind\nspecified in [\u00a7523(a)(8)].\u201d \u00a71328(a)(2).

See supra,\nat 4. We must decide whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\norder confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan is \u201cvoid\u201d under Federal\nRule Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) because the Bankruptcy\nCourt confirmed the plan without complying with these\nrequirements.8\n                              A\n\n  The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s\n\nproposed plan was a final judgment, see In re Optical \n\nTechnologies, Inc., 425 F. 3d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005), from\n\nwhich United did not appeal. Ordinarily, \u201cthe finality of\n\n[a] Bankruptcy Court\u2019s orders following the conclusion of\ndirect review\u201d would \u201cstan[d] in the way of challenging\n[their] enforceability.\u201d Travelers Indemnity Co. v.

Although the term \u201cvoid\u201d describes a result, rather\nthan the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable,\nit suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by\na fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised\neven after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally id., \u00a712.\nThe list of such infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise,\nRule 60(b)(4)\u2019s exception to finality would swallow the\nrule.\n   \u201cA judgment is not void,\u201d for example, \u201csimply because it\nis or may have been erroneous.\u201d Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F. 3d\n1, 6 (CA1 1995); 12 J. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Prac\u00ad\ntice \u00a760.44[1][a], pp. 60\u2013150 to 60\u2013151 (3d ed. 2007) (here\u00ad\ninafter Moore\u2019s). Similarly, a motion under Rule 60(b)(4)\nis not a substitute for a timely appeal. Kocher v. Dow\nChemical Co., 132 F. 3d 1225, 1229 (CA8 1997); see\nMoore\u2019s \u00a760.44[1][a], at 60\u2013150. Instead, Rule 60(b)(4)\napplies only in the rare instance where a judgment is\npremised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or\non a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice\nor the opportunity to be heard. See United States v. Boch\nOldsmobile, Inc., 909 F. 2d 657, 661 (CA1 1990); Moore\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfraud.\u201d Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Rule 60(b)(4)\nmotion should be treated as a \u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d a plan subject to\n\u00a71330\u2019s time limit and substantive limitation to motions based on\nfraud. Compare Whelton, 432 F. 3d, at 156, n. 2, with In re Fesq, 153\nF. 3d 113, 119, and n. 8 (CA3 1998). We need not settle that question,\nhowever, because the parties did not raise it in the courts below. And\neven under a theory that would treat United\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion as a\n\u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d the plan, United\u2019s failure to file its motion within\n\u00a71330(a)\u2019s 180-day deadline and its failure to seek relief on the basis of\nfraud did not deprive those courts\u2014and does not deprive us\u2014of author\u00ad\nity to consider the motion on the merits because those limitations are\nnot jurisdictional.

Nemaizer v. Baker, 793\nF. 2d 58, 65 (CA2 1986); see, e.g., Boch Oldsmobile, supra,\nat 661\u2013662 (\u201c[T]otal want of jurisdiction must be distin\u00ad\nguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction, and\n. . . only rare instances of a clear usurpation of power will\nrender a judgment void\u201d (brackets and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n    This case presents no occasion to engage in such an\n\u201carguable basis\u201d inquiry or to define the precise circum\u00ad\nstances in which a jurisdictional error will render a judg\u00ad\nment void because United does not argue that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s error was jurisdictional. Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 5, 11. Such an argument would fail in any\nevent. First, \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s statutory requirement that a\nbankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging\na student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a dis\u00ad\ncharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 515\u2013516 (2006). Second, the requirement that a\nbankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule Proc.\n7001(6), which are \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the Court\nfor the orderly transaction of its business\u201d that are \u201cnot\njurisdictional.\u201d Kontrick v.

Specifically, United argues that the\nBankruptcy Court violated United\u2019s due process rights by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan despite Espinosa\u2019s failure to\nserve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules\nrequire for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.\nWe disagree.\n     Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons\nand complaint deprived United of a right granted by a\nprocedural rule. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3).\nUnited could have timely objected to this deprivation and\nappealed from an adverse ruling on its objection. But this\ndeprivation did not amount to a violation of United\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process. Due process requires\nnotice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,\nto apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action\nand afford them an opportunity to present their objec\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\nU. S. 306, 314 (1950); see also Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S.\n220, 225 (2006) (\u201c[D]ue process does not require actual\nnotice . . .\u201d). Here, United received actual notice of the\nfiling and contents of Espinosa\u2019s plan. This more than\nsatisfied United\u2019s due process rights. Accordingly, on\nthese facts, Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve a summons and\ncomplaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule\n60(b)(4).\n                            B\n     Unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Specifically, they contend\nthat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is void\nbecause the court lacked statutory authority to confirm\nEspinosa\u2019s plan absent a finding of undue hardship. In\nsupport of this contention, they cite the text of \u00a7523(a)(8),\nwhich provides that student loan debts guaranteed by\ngovernmental units are not dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a court\nfinds undue hardship. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(8) (emphasis\nadded). They argue that this language imposes a \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting\u2019 limitation on the effect of a discharge order\u201d\nthat renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus\nvoid, if it is not satisfied.

In addition, United cites \u00a71325(a)(1), which\ninstructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans\nthat comply with \u201cthe . . . applicable provisions\u201d of the\nCode. Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues\nthat an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge\na student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is\n\u201cdoubly beyond the court\u2019s authority and therefore void.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 13.\n   We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hard\u00ad\nship in accordance with \u00a7523(a)(8) is on par with the\njurisdictional and notice failings that define void judg\u00ad\nments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4). As\nnoted, \u00a7523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction over student loan debts.10 Supra, at 9\u201310; see\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Sections 1328(a) and 523(a)(8) provide that student loan debt is\n\ndischargeable in a Chapter 13 proceeding if a court makes a finding of\nundue hardship. In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide\nthat certain other debts are not dischargeable under any circumstances.\nSee, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); \u00a7523(a)(5) (domestic\nsupport obligations); \u00a7523(a)(9) (debts \u201ccaused by\u201d the debtor\u2019s unlawful\n12       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

Nor\ndoes the provision impose requirements that, if violated,\nwould result in a denial of due process. Instead, \u00a7523(a)(8)\nrequires a court to make a certain finding before confirm\u00ad\ning the discharge of a student loan debt. It is true, as we\nexplained in Hood, that this requirement is \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 450.11 But that means only that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\noperation of a vehicle while intoxicated). We express no view on the\nconditions under which an order confirming the discharge of one of\nthese types of debt could be set aside as void.\n    11 The Government suggests that \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s \u201cself-executing\u201d nature\n\nderives in part from the text of \u00a7523(a), which states that \u201c[a] discharge\nunder section 727 . . . or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an\nindividual debtor from any debt,\u201d including the student loan debts\nspecified in paragraph (8) (emphasis added); see Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 18; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 1\u20132. That is\nnot what we concluded in Hood and, in this case, would be irrelevant in\nany event.\n    In Hood, we described as \u201c \u2018self-executing\u2019 \u201d paragraph (8)\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntion that student loan debt not be discharged \u201cunless\u201d an undue hard\u00ad\nship determination is made. 541 U.

The \u201cdoes not dis\u00ad\ncharge\u201d language in \u00a7523(a), which applies generally to every\nenumerated paragraph in that section\u2014and to which we never referred\nin Hood\u2014was not relevant to our analysis. That is evident from the\nauthority we cited to support our description of \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s condition as\n\u201c \u2018self-executing.\u2019 \u201d E.g., id., at 450 (citing S. Rep.

Rule 60(b)(4) does not\nprovide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.\nUnited had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa\u2019s plan,\nits contents, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s subsequent\nconfirmation of the plan. In addition, United filed a proof\nof claim regarding Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt, thereby\nsubmitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction\nwith respect to that claim. See Langenkamp v. Culp, 498\nU. S. 42, 44 (1990) (per curiam). United therefore forfeited\nits arguments regarding the validity of service or the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsis added). Section 1328(a) thus incorporates by reference paragraph\n(8) of \u00a7523(a), including that paragraph\u2019s self-executing requirement for\nan undue hardship determination, but does not incorporate the \u201cdoes\nnot discharge\u201d text of \u00a7523(a) itself.\n  12 United relies on our decisions in United States ex rel. Wilson v.\n\nWalker, 109 U. S. 258 (1883), and Vallely v. Northern Fire & Marine\nIns. Co., 254 U. S. 348 (1920), to argue otherwise. Those authorities\nare not controlling because they predate Rule 60(b)(4)\u2019s enactment and\nbecause we interpreted the statutes at issue in those cases as stripping\ncourts of jurisdiction\u2014either over the parties, id., at 354\u2013356, or the\nres, Wilson, supra, at 265\u2013266\u2014and United concedes that the statutory\nlimit in this case is not jurisdictional. See supra, at 9.\n14     UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s procedures by failing\nto raise a timely objection in that court.\n   Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for\nfinality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that\nlitigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a\ndispute. Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan\u2019s\ncontents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan\nbefore the time for appeal expires, that party has been\nafforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the\nparty\u2019s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not\njustify Rule 60(b)(4) relief. We thus agree with the Court\nof Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order\nis not void.\n                            III\n  In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals\nlooked beyond the narrow question whether the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan was void\nunder Rule 60(b)(4). It canvassed other bankruptcy court\ndecisions within the Circuit that presented a different\nquestion\u2014whether a bankruptcy court presented with a\ndebtor\u2019s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan\ndebt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to deter\u00ad\nmine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its\nfailure to comply with the Code and Rules. The Court of\nAppeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined\nto confirm such plans \u201ceven when the creditor fail[ed] to\nobject to the plan.\u201d 553 F. 3d, at 1205. The court disap\u00ad\nproved that practice and overruled those cases, stating\nthat bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the\ndischarge of a student loan debt without a determination\nof undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the\ncreditor timely raises a specific objection. Ibid. This, we\nthink, was a step too far.\n  As Espinosa concedes, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 36, a Chapter\n13 plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout a determination of undue hardship violates\n\u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this\nself-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of\nthe plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in\nthe proceeding at all. See Hood, 541 U. S., at 450.13 That\nis because \u00a71325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to con\u00ad\nfirm a plan only if the court finds, inter alia, that the plan\ncomplies with the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the Code.\n\u00a71325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court \u201cshall confirm\na plan\u201d if the plan \u201ccomplies with the provisions of\u201d Chap\u00ad\nter 13 and with \u201cother applicable provisions of this title\u201d);\nsee Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S. 78, 87 (1991);\nsee also \u00a7105(a) (authorizing bankruptcy courts to issue\n\u201cany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or\nappropriate to carry out\u201d the Code\u2019s provisions).14 Thus,\ncontrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 assertion, the Code\nmakes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority\u2014\nindeed, the obligation\u2014to direct a debtor to conform his\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 This is essential to preserve the distinction between Congress\u2019\n\ntreatment of student loan debts in \u00a7523(a)(8) and debts listed elsewhere\nin \u00a7523. Section 523(a)(8) renders student loan debt presumptively\nnondischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a determination of undue hardship is made.\nIn contrast, the debts listed in \u00a7523(c), which include certain debts\nobtained by fraud or \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor,\u201d\n\u00a7523(a)(6), are presumptively dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d the creditor\nrequests a hearing to determine the debt\u2019s dischargeability. The Court\nof Appeals\u2019 approach would subject student loan debt to the same rules\nas the debts specified in \u00a7523(c), notwithstanding the evident differ\u00ad\nences in the statutory framework for discharging the two types of debt.\n   14 In other contexts, we have held that courts have the discretion, but\n\nnot the obligation, to raise on their own initiative certain nonjurisdic\u00ad\ntional barriers to suit. See Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202, 209\n(2006) (statute of limitations); Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 134\n(1987) (habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s exhaustion of state remedies).\nSection 1325(a) does more than codify this principle; it requires bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to address and correct a defect in a debtor\u2019s proposed plan\neven if no creditor raises the issue.\n16      UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nplan to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).15\n  We are mindful that conserving assets is an important\nconcern in a bankruptcy proceeding. We thus assume\nthat, in some cases, a debtor and creditor may agree that\npayment of a student loan debt will cause the debtor an\nundue hardship sufficient to justify discharge. In such a\ncase, there is no reason that compliance with the undue\nhardship requirement should impose significant costs on\nthe parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.\nNeither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from\nstipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and\nneither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a\nsummons and complaint. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc.\n7004; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k). But, to comply with\n\u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an\nindependent determination of undue hardship before a\nplan is confirmed, even if the creditor fails to object or\nappear in the adversary proceeding. See supra, at 12.\n                            IV\n  United argues that our failure to declare the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order void will encourage unscrupulous\ndebtors to abuse the Chapter 13 process by filing plans\nproposing to dispense with the undue hardship require\u00ad\nment in the hopes the bankruptcy court will overlook the\nproposal and the creditor will not object. In the event the\nobjectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the\ndebtor can withdraw the plan and file another without\npenalty.\n  We acknowledge the potential for bad-faith litigation\ntactics. But expanding the availability of relief under Rule\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Bankruptcy courts appear to be well aware of this statutory obliga\u00ad\n\ntion. See, e.g., In re Mammel, 221 B. R. 238, 239 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Iowa\n1998) (\u201c[W]hether or not an objection is presently lodged in this case,\nthe Court retains the authority to review this plan and deny confirma\u00ad\ntion if it fails to comply with the confirmation standards of the Code\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n60(b)(4) is not an appropriate prophylaxis. As we stated in\nTaylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638 (1992),\n\u201c[d]ebtors and their attorneys face penalties under various\nprovisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy\nproceedings,\u201d id., at 644; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011.\nThe specter of such penalties should deter bad-faith at\u00ad\ntempts to discharge student loan debt without the undue\nhardship finding Congress required. And to the extent\nexisting sanctions prove inadequate to this task, Congress\nmay enact additional provisions to address the difficulties\nUnited predicts will follow our decision.\n                     *   *    *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit is affirmed.\n                                      It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
