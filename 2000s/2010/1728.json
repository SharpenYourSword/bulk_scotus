Argued December 1, 2009—Decided March 8, 2010*\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n  2005 (BAPCPA) amended the Bankruptcy Code to define a class of\n  bankruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].” 11 U. S. C.\n  §101(12A). That class includes, with limited exceptions, “any person\n  who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person . . . for\n  . . . payment . . . , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” Ibid.\n  The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from “advis[ing] an as\n  sisted person . . . to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for\n  bankruptcy] . . . .” §526(a)(4). It also requires them to disclose in\n  their advertisements for certain services that the services are with\n  respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, §§528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and\n  to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, §§528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).\n      The plaintiffs in this litigation—a law firm and others (collectively\n  Milavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, ar\n  guing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA’s debt-relief-agency\n  provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional\n  debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertise\n  ments. The District Court found that “debt relief agency” does not\n  include attorneys and that §§526 and 528 are unconstitutional as ap\n  plied to that class of professionals. The Eighth Circuit affirmed in\n  part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court’s conclusion\n  that attorneys are not “debt relief agenc[ies]”; upholding application\n  of §528’s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding §526(a)(4)\n  unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–1225, United States v.

UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    from advising assisted persons to incur any additional debt in con\n    templation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent\n    prebankruptcy planning.\nHeld:\n    1. Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons\n are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA. By definition, “bank\n ruptcy assistance” includes several services commonly performed by\n attorneys, e.g., providing “advice, counsel, [or] document prepara\n tion,” §101(4A). Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the\n debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude\n attorneys. See §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Milavetz relies on the fact that\n §101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a nar\n rower understanding. On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition\n preparer would qualify—an implausibility given that a “debt relief\n agency” is “any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance . . . or\n who is a bankruptcy petition preparer,” ibid. Milavetz’s other argu\n ments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive. Pp. 5–9.\n    2. Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advis\n ing a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bank\n ruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose. The statute’s language, to\n gether with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of §526(a)(4) the\n natural one. Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v. Pender, 289 U. S. 472, sup\n ports this conclusion. The Court in that case read now-repealed\n §96(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor’s attorney’s fees\n payment “in contemplation of the filing of a petition,” to require that\n the portended bankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, id.,\n at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.\n The Court identified the “controlling question” as “whether the\n thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction,”\n ibid.    Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d) and\n 526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise\n whether the impelling reason for “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to\n incur more debt” was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. In prac\n tice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of\n advice to “load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its dis\n charge.     The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n §526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct. The\n Court rejects Milavetz’s arguments for a more expansive view of\n §526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is\n impermissibly vague. Pp. 9–18.\n    3. Section 528’s disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Mi\n lavetz. Consistent with Milavetz’s characterization, the Court pre\n sumes that this is an as-applied challenge. Because §528 is directed\n at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure re\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  quirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less\n  exacting scrutiny set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel\n  of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs. There, the Court\n  found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\n  quirements offend the First Amendment, “an advertiser’s rights are\n  adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasona\n  bly related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consum\n  ers.” Id., at 651. Section 528’s requirements share the essential fea\n  tures of the rule challenged in Zauderer. The disclosures are\n  intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial\n  advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the\n  advertiser’s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.\n  Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying\n  any additional information through their advertisements. In re R. M.\n  J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished. Because §528’s requirements are\n  “reasonably related” to the Government’s interest in preventing con\n  sumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Mi\n  lavetz.

See 11 U. S. C.\n§§101(3), (12A). These consolidated cases present the\nthreshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agen\ncies when they provide qualifying services. Because we\nagree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must\nalso consider whether the Act’s provisions governing debt\nrelief agencies’ advice to clients, §526(a)(4), and requiring\nthem to make certain disclosures in their advertisements,\n2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n§§528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of\nattorneys. Concluding that the Court of Appeals con\nstrued §526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment\nthat the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like\nthe Court of Appeals, we uphold §528’s disclosure re\nquirements as applied in these consolidated cases.\n                              I\n   In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Con\ngress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provi\nsions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.\nSome of these measures apply to the broad class of bank\nruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].” That\ncategory includes, with limited exceptions, “any person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson in return for . . . payment . . . , or who is a bank\nruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A).1 “Bankruptcy assis\ntance” refers to goods or services “provided to an assisted\nperson with the express or implied purpose of providing\ninformation, advice, counsel, document preparation, or\nfiling, or attendance at a creditors’ meeting or appearing\nin a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing\nlegal representation with respect to a case or proceeding”\nin bankruptcy. §101(4A). An “assisted person” is someone\nwith limited nonexempt property whose debts consist\nprimarily of consumer debts. §101(3). The BAPCPA\nsubjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions\nand requirements, as set forth in §§526, 527, and 528. As\n——————\n   1 Congress excluded from the definition of “debt relief agency” any\n\n“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who provides [bank\nruptcy] assistance”; any “nonprofit organization that is exempt from\ntaxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986”;\n“a creditor of [an] assisted person” who is helping that person “to\nrestructure any debt owed . . . to the creditor”; “a depository institu\ntion”; or “an author, publisher, distributor, or seller of works subject to\ncopyright protection under title 17, when acting in such capacity.”\n§§101(12A)(A)–(E).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, §526(a) establishes several rules of profes\nsional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agen\ncies. Among them, §526(a)(4) states that a debt relief\nagency shall not “advise an assisted person . . . to incur\nmore debt in contemplation of such person filing a case\nunder this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy peti\ntion preparer fee or charge for services performed as part\nof preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under\nthis title.”\n   Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include\ncertain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection (a)\nprovides that debt relief agencies must “clearly and con\nspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy\nassistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy di\nrected to the general public . . . that the services or bene\nfits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.”\n§528(a)(3). It also requires them to include the following,\n“or a substantially similar statement”: “We are a debt\nrelief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief\nunder the Bankruptcy Code.” §528(a)(4). Subsection (b)\nrequires essentially the same disclosures in advertise\nments “indicating that the debt relief agency provides\nassistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage fore\nclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collec\ntion pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.”\n§528(b)(2). Debt relief agencies advertising such services\nmust disclose “that the assistance may involve bankruptcy\nrelief,” §528(b)(2)(A), and must identify themselves as\n“debt relief agenc[ies]” as required by §528(a)(4), see\n§528(b)(2)(B).\n                              II\n  The plaintiffs in this litigation—the law firm Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz, P. A.; the firm’s president, Robert J.\nMilavetz; a bankruptcy attorney at the firm, Barbara\nNilva Nevin; and two of the firm’s clients (collectively\n4      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nMilavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit in Federal District\nCourt seeking declaratory relief with respect to the Act’s\ndebt-relief-agency provisions. Milavetz asked the court to\nhold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may\nfreely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not\nidentify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.\n   Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not “debt relief\nagenc[ies]” as that term is used in the BAPCPA. In the\nalternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that §§526(a)(4)\nand 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to\nattorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that\nthe term “debt relief agency” does not include attorneys,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1119, p. A–15, but only\nafter finding that §§526 and 528—provisions expressly\napplicable only to debt relief agencies—are unconstitu\ntional as applied to this class of professionals.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. 541 F. 3d 785 (2008). Relying\non the Act’s plain language, the court unanimously re\njected the District Court’s conclusion that attorneys are\nnot “debt relief agenc[ies]” within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District\nCourt concerning the constitutionality of §528. Conclud\ning that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer\ndeception and are “reasonably related” to that interest, the\ncourt upheld the application of §528’s disclosure require\nments to attorneys. Id., at 796–797 (citing Zauderer v.\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,\n471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985)).\n   A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed\nwith the District Court that §526(a)(4) is invalid. Deter\nmining that §526(a)(4) “broadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy,” even when that advice constitutes prudent\nprebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bank\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nruptcy laws, 541 F. 3d, at 793, the majority held that\n§526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermedi\nate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that\n§526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice\nto abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construc\ntion would avoid most constitutional difficulties. See id.,\nat 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,2 we\ngranted certiorari to resolve the question of §526(a)(4)’s\nscope. 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We also agreed to consider\nthe threshold question whether attorneys who provide\nbankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are “debt relief\nagenc[ies]” within the meaning of §101(12A) and the re\nlated question whether §528’s disclosure requirements are\nconstitutional.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  We first consider whether the term “debt relief agency”\nincludes attorneys. If it does not, we need not reach the\nother questions presented, as §§526 and 528 govern only\nthe conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz chal\nlenges the validity of those provisions based on their\napplication to attorneys. The Government contends that\n“debt relief agency” plainly includes attorneys, while\nMilavetz urges that it does not. We conclude that the\nGovernment has the better view.\n  As already noted, a debt relief agency is “any person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson” in return for payment. §101(12A). By definition,\n“bankruptcy assistance” includes several services com\n——————\n  2 Compare 541 F. 3d 785, 794 (CA8 2008) (case below), with Hersh v.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Mukasey, 553 F. 3d 743, 761, 764 (CA5 2008)\n(holding that §526(a)(4) can be narrowly construed to prohibit only\nadvice to abuse or manipulate the bankruptcy system and that, so\nconstrued, it is constitutional).\n6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nmonly performed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of\nbankruptcy assistance, including the “provi[sion of] legal\nrepresentation with respect to a case or proceeding,”\n§101(4A), may be provided only by attorneys.             See\n§110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from\nproviding legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating specific\nexceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress\ngave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.\nSee §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Thus, as the Government con\ntends, the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys\nare debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying\nservices to assisted persons.3\n  In advocating a narrower understanding of that term,\nMilavetz relies heavily on the fact that §101(12A) does not\nexpressly include attorneys. That omission stands in\ncontrast, it argues, to the provision’s explicit inclusion of\n“bankruptcy petition preparer[s]”—a category of profes\nsionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see\n§110(a)(1). But Milavetz does not contend, nor could it\ncredibly, that only professionals expressly included in the\ndefinition are debt relief agencies. On that reading, no\nprofessional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer\nwould qualify—an implausible reading given that the\nstatute defines “debt relief agency” as “any person who\n——————\n   3 Although reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of\n\nthe statute’s unambiguous language, we note the support that record\nprovides for the Government’s reading. Statements in a Report of the\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Act’s purpose indicate\nconcern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys as well as\nother bankruptcy professionals. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1,\np. 5 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the legislative record else\nwhere documents misconduct by attorneys. See, e.g., Hearing on H. R.\n3150 before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law\nof the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. III,\np. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998 Hearings). (While the 1998 Hearings\npreceded the BAPCPA’s enactment by several years, they form part of\nthe record cited by the 2005 House Report. See H. R. Rep., at 7.)\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person\n. . . or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A)\n(emphasis added). The provision’s silence regarding at\ntorneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf. Heintz v. Jenkins,\n514 U. S. 291, 294 (1995) (holding that “debt collector” as\nused in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S. C.\n§1692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the defini\ntion’s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).\n    Milavetz’s other arguments for excluding attorneys\nsimilarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute’s\nplain language.       Milavetz contends that 11 U. S. C.\n§526(d)(2)’s instruction that §§526, 527, and 528 should\nnot “be deemed to limit or curtail” States’ authority to\n“determine and enforce qualifications for the practice of\nlaw” counsels against reading “debt relief agency” to in\nclude attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States’\nrole in regulating the legal profession is to make the\nBAPCPA’s professional conduct rules inapplicable to\nlawyers. We find that §526(d)(2) supports the opposite\nconclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact\nthat provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not\napply to attorneys. Milavetz’s broader claim that reading\n§101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on\nan area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.\nCongress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen\naspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial\nfederal concern. See, e.g., Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v.\nPender, 289 U. S. 472, 477–479 (1933) (finding broad\nauthorization in former §96(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978)\nfor courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor’s\nprepetition attorney’s fees).\n    Milavetz next argues that §101(12A)’s exception for any\n“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who pro\nvides” bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to\ninclude “partners.” §101(12A)(A). In light of that omis\nsion, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies\n8       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwill obligate entire law firms to comply with §§526, 527,\nand 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while\nthe agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typi\ncally organized as partnerships are shielded from those\nrequirements. Given that the partnership structure is not\nunique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclu\nsion would be revealing of Congress’ intent only with\nrespect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are them\nselves “person[s]” under the BAPCPA, see §101(41), and\ncan qualify as “debt relief agenc[ies]” when they meet the\ncriteria set forth in §101(12A). Moreover, a partnership’s\nemployees and agents are exempted from §101(12A) in the\nsame way as the employees and agents of other organiza\ntions. To the extent that partners may be subject to the\ndebt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is\nconsistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow\nfrom the partnership structure, cf. Strang v. Bradner, 114\nU. S. 555, 561 (1885). Accordingly, we decline to attribute\nthe significance Milavetz suggests to §101(12A)(A)’s fail\nure to include partners among the exempted actors.4\n   All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of consti\ntutional avoidance requires us to read “debt relief agency”\n——————\n  4 Reviving an argument that Milavetz abandoned, amici contend that\n\n§527(b) undermines the Government’s reading of §101(12A) because it\nrequires a debt relief agency to inform an assisted person of his right to\nhire an attorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to\nprovide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34. This argument fails\non its own terms. Even if §101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz\ncontends, §527(b) would still produce the result of which its amici\ncomplain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform\nassisted persons that they “ ‘can get help in some localities from a\nbankruptcy petition preparer,’ ” and there is no question that bank\nruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to\nthat requirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief\nagencies—whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers—to\ninform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy\nassistance services.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto exclude attorneys in order to forestall serious doubts as\nto the validity of §§526 and 528. The avoidance canon,\nhowever, “is a tool for choosing between competing plausi\nble interpretations of a statutory text.” Clark v. Martinez,\n543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005). In applying that tool, we will\nconsider only those constructions of a statute that are\n“ ‘fairly possible.’ ” United States v. Security Industrial\nBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). For the reasons already\ndiscussed, the text and statutory context of §101(12A)\nforeclose a reading of “debt relief agency” that excludes\nattorneys. Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who pro\nvide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt\nrelief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.\n                              B\n   Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies\nwhen they provide qualifying services, we next address the\nscope and validity of §526(a)(4). Characterizing the stat\nute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client\ncommunications that is not adequately tailored to con\nstrain only speech the Government has a substantial\ninterest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule\nsubstantially overbroad. 541 F. 3d, at 793–794, and n. 10.\nFor the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.\n   Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from\n“advis[ing] an assisted person” either “to incur more debt\nin contemplation of” filing for bankruptcy “or to pay an\nattorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for\nservices” performed in preparation for filing. Only the\nfirst of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the\ncorrectness of the Court of Appeals’ decision, the parties\nfirst dispute the provision’s scope. The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that “§526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy.” Id., at 793. Under that reading, an attorney\n10     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nis prohibited from providing all manner of “beneficial\nadvice—even if the advice could help the assisted person\navoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.” Ibid.\n   Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, Milavetz contends\nthat §526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from advising\na client to incur any new debt while considering whether\nto file for bankruptcy. Construing the provision more\nbroadly still, Milavetz contends that §526(a)(4) forbids not\nonly affirmative advice but also any discussion of the\nadvantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more\ndebt. Like the panel majority’s, Milavetz’s reading rests\nprimarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the\nphrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy encompasses any\nadvice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might\nsoon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate\nthe need to file. Milavetz also maintains that if §526(a)(4)\nwere construed more narrowly, as urged by the Govern\nment and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to\ninevitably chill some protected speech.\n   The Government continues to advocate a narrower\nconstruction of the statute, urging that Milavetz’s reading\nis untenable and that its vagueness concerns are mis\nplaced. The Government contends that §526(a)(4)’s re\nstriction on advice to incur more debt “in contemplation of”\nbankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to\nundertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system. Focus\ning first on the provision’s text, the Government points to\nsources indicating that the phrase “in contemplation of”\nbankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated\nwith abusive conduct. For instance, Black’s Law Diction\nary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “con\ntemplation of bankruptcy” as “[t]he thought of declaring\nbankruptcy because of the inability to continue current\nfinancial operations, often coupled with action designed to\nthwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceed\ning.” Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illus\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrates that traditional coupling. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 98–\n65, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of “ ‘loading up’ [on\ndebt] in contemplation of bankruptcy”); Report of the\nCommission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States,\nH. R. Doc. No. 93–137, pt. I, p. 11 (1973) (“[T]he most\nserious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of\ninstances in which individuals have purchased a sizable\nquantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of\nbankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge”).\nThe Government also points to early American and Eng\nlish judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that “in\ncontemplation of” bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct.\nSee, e.g., In re Pearce, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt.\n1843); Morgan v. Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296–297, 110\nEng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).\n   To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on\n§526(a)(4)’s immediate context. According to the Govern\nment, the other three subsections of §526(a) are designed\nto protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief\nagencies: §526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to per\nform all promised services; §526(a)(2) prohibits them from\nmaking or advising debtors to make false or misleading\nstatements in bankruptcy; and §526(a)(3) prohibits them\nfrom misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of\nbankruptcy. When §526(a)(4) is read in context of these\ndebtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,\nconstruing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving\nadvice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors\nseems particularly nonsensical.\n   Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA’s\nremedies for violations of §526(a)(4) similarly corroborate\nits narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies for a\ndebt relief agency’s violation of §526, §527, or §528.\nAmong the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the at\ntorney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable\nattorney’s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue\n12    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nfor a resident’s actual damages; and a court finding inten\ntional abuse may impose an appropriate civil penalty.\n§526(c). The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit’s\ndecision in Hersh v. United States ex rel. Mukasey, 553\nF. 3d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton’s dissent below for\nthe observation that “Congress’s emphasis on actual dam\nages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests\nthat Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to\ndebtors which if followed would have a significant risk of\nharming the debtor.” Id., at 760; see 541 F. 3d, at 800\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By\ncontrast, “legal and appropriate advice that would be\nprotected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a\nbroad reading of §526(a)(4), should cause no damage at\nall.” Ibid.; see Hersh, 541 F. 3d, at 760.\n   Milavetz contends that the Government’s sources actu\nally undermine its claim that the phrase “in contemplation\nof” bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct.\nSpecifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities illus\ntrate that “in contemplation of” bankruptcy is a neutral\nphrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to\nan additional, proscriptive term. As Black’s states, the\nphrase is “often coupled with action designed to thwart the\ndistribution of assets” in bankruptcy, Black’s 336 (empha\nsis added), but it carries no independent connotation of\nabuse. In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on\nour decision in Pender, 289 U. S. 472, contending that we\nconstrued “in contemplation of” bankruptcy in that case to\ndescribe “conduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy\nfiling and nothing more.” Brief for Milavetz 61.\n   After reviewing these competing claims, we are per\nsuaded that a narrower reading of §526(a)(4) is sounder,\nalthough we do not adopt precisely the view the Govern\nment advocates. The Government’s sources show that the\nphrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy has so commonly\nbeen associated with abusive conduct that it may readily\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe understood to prefigure abuse. As used in §526(a)(4),\nhowever, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of\nmisconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the\nbankruptcy system. In light of our decision in Pender, and\nin context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that\n§526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising\na debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for\nbankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.\n    Pender addressed the meaning of former §96(d), which\nauthorized reexamination of a debtor’s payment of attor\nney’s fees “in contemplation of the filing of a petition.”\nRecognizing “ ‘the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too\nliberally with his property in enabling counsel to protect\nhim,’ ” 289 U. S., at 478 (quoting In re Wood & Henderson,\n210 U. S. 246, 253 (1908)), we read “in contemplation of\n. . . filing” in that context to require that the portended\nbankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, 289\nU. S., at 477, understanding inducement to engender\nsuspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we identi\nfied the “controlling question” as “whether the thought of\nbankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.”\nIbid. Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d)\nand 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the\nlatter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason\nfor “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to incur more debt”\nwas the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.\n    To be sure, there are relevant differences between the\nprovision at issue in Pender and the one now under re\nview. Most notably, the inquiry in Pender was as to pay\nments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas §526(a)(4)\nregards advice to incur additional debts. Consistent with\nthat difference, under §96(d) a finding that a payment was\nmade “in contemplation of” filing resolved only a threshold\ninquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of\nthe payment; the finding thus supported an inference of\nabuse but did not conclusively establish it. By contrast,\n14    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadvice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as pro\nhibited by §526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to\n“load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its\ndischarge—i.e., conduct that is abusive per se.\n   The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n§526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of\nabuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already\nsought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior\nto filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the\nattendant risk of manipulation by preventing the dis\ncharge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making\ndebts for purchases of luxury goods or services presump\ntively nondischargeable. See §§523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000\ned.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, how\never, by providing a new mechanism for determining a\ndebtor’s ability to repay. Pursuant to the “means tes[t],”\n§707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor’s petition for Chapter 7\nrelief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dis\nmissed or converted to a structured repayment plan under\nChapter 13) if the debtor’s current monthly income ex\nceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including pay\nments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed\namount. See §§707(b)(2)(A)(i)–(iv). The test promotes\ndebtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur\nadditional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured\ndebts offset a debtor’s monthly income under the formula.\nOther amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a\nconcern with this practice.        For instance, Congress\namended §523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge\nby lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor\nmust assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under\n§523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling win\ndow. See §310, 119 Stat. 84. In context, §526(a)(4) is best\nunderstood to provide an additional safeguard against the\npractice of loading up on debt prior to filing.\n   The Government’s contextual arguments provide addi\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional support for the view that §526(a)(4) was meant to\nprevent this type of conduct. The companion rules of\nprofessional conduct in §§526(a)(1)–(3) and the remedies\nfor their violation in §526(c) indicate that Congress was\nconcerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or\ncreditors. Unlike the reasonable financial advice the\nEighth Circuit’s broad reading would proscribe, advice to\nincur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a sub\nstantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors. See\nHersh, 553 F. 3d, at 760–761. Specifically, the incurrence\nof such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition\nconduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargable,\nsee §523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or\ndismiss it altogether, see §707(b), thereby defeating his\neffort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although\nmanipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abu\nsive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm\nas a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of\nthe bankruptcy estate. By contrast, the prudent advice\nthat the Eighth Circuit’s view of the statute forbids would\nlikely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very\nleast should cause no harm. See id., at 760; 541 F. 3d, at\n800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). For all of these reasons, we conclude that §526(a)(4)\nprohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an as\nsisted person to incur more debt when the impelling rea\nson for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\n   That “[n]o other solution yields as sensible a” result\nfurther persuades us of the correctness of this narrow\nreading. United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 55\n(1994). It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys\nand other debt relief agencies from advising individuals\nthinking of filing for bankruptcy about options that would\nbe beneficial to both those individuals and their creditors.\nThat construction serves none of the purposes of the Bank\nruptcy Code or the amendments enacted through the\n16      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBAPCPA. Milavetz itself acknowledges that its expansive\nview of §526(a)(4) would produce absurd results; that is\none of its bases for arguing that “debt relief agency” should\nbe construed to exclude attorneys. Because the language\nand context of §526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted pur\npose, we can avoid the absurdity of which Milavetz com\nplains without reaching the result it advocates.\n   For the same reason, we reject Milavetz’s suggestion\nthat §526(a)(4) broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from\ndiscussing covered subjects instead of merely proscribing\naffirmative advice to undertake a particular action. Sec\ntion 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies\nonly from “advis[ing]” assisted persons “to incur” more\ndebt. Covered professionals remain free to “tal[k] fully\nand candidly about the incurrence of debt in contempla\ntion of filing a bankruptcy case.” Brief for Milavetz 73.\nSection 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid\ninstructing or encouraging assisted persons to take on\nmore debt in that circumstance. Cf. ABA Model Rule of\nProfessional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (“A lawyer shall not\ncounsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct\nthat the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a\nlawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any pro\nposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or\nassist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the\nvalidity, scope, meaning or application of the law”). Even\nif the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach\nthe same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition\nof frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within\nthe statutory scheme. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 529\nU. S. 694, 706, n. 9 (2000).5\n——————\n   5 If read as Milavetz advocates, §526(a)(4) would seriously undermine\n\nthe attorney-client relationship. Earlier this Term, we acknowledged\nthe importance of the attorney-client privilege as a means of protecting\nthat relationship and fostering robust discussion. See Mohawk Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7). Reiter\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Milavetz\nurges that the concept of abusive prefiling conduct is too\nindefinite to withstand constitutional scrutiny and that\nuncertainty regarding the scope of the prohibition will\nchill protected speech. We disagree.\n   Under our reading of the statute, of course, the prohib\nited advice is not defined in terms of abusive prefiling\nconduct but rather the incurrence of additional debt when\nthe impelling reason is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\nEven if the test depended upon the notion of abuse, how\never, Milavetz’s claim would be fatally undermined by\nother provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which that\nconcept is no stranger. As discussed above, the Code\nauthorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge\nfraudulent debts, see §523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or\nconvert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that\ngranting relief would constitute abuse, see §707(b)(1).\nAttorneys and other professionals who give debtors bank\nruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their\nconsequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs addi\ntional debt prior to filing. Indeed, §707(b)(4)(C) states that\nan attorney’s signature on bankruptcy filings “shall consti\ntute a certification that the attorney has” determined that\nthe filing “does not constitute an abuse under [§707(b)(1)].”\nAgainst this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that\nnarrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising\na client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct\ncould chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client\nrelationship. Our construction of §526(a)(4) to prevent\nonly advice principally motivated by the prospect of bank\n\n—————— \n\nating the significance of such dialogue, we note that §526(a)(4), as\n\nnarrowly construed, presents no impediment to “ ‘full and frank’ ” \n\ndiscussions. Ibid. (quoting Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383,\n\n389 (1981)). \n\n18      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nruptcy further ensures that professionals cannot unknow\ningly run afoul of its proscription.6 Because the scope of\nthe prohibition is adequately defined, both on its own\nterms and by reference to the Code’s other provisions, we\nreject Milavetz’s vagueness claim.\n  As the foregoing shows, the language of the statute,\ntogether with other evidence of its purpose, makes this\nnarrow reading of §526(a)(4) not merely a plausible inter\npretation but the more natural one. Accordingly, we reject\nthe Eighth Circuit’s conclusion and hold that a debt relief\nagency violates §526(a)(4) only when the impetus of the\nadvice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for\nbankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief. Because\nour reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for\nreversing the Court of Appeals’ decision, and because\nMilavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as\nnarrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further\nconsider whether the statute so construed withstands\nFirst Amendment scrutiny.\n                          C\n  Finally, we address the validity of §528’s challenged\ndisclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving this\n——————\n  6 The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits regarding the permissi\n\nbility of advice to incur debt in certain circumstances, see Brief for\nMilavetz 48–51, are easily answered by reference to whether the\nexpectation of filing for bankruptcy (and obtaining a discharge) im\npelled the advice. We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of\nbankruptcy is insufficient to trigger §526(a)(4)’s prohibition. Instead,\nthat provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is princi\npally motivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mort\ngage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will\nreduce the debtor’s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not\nprohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than\nthe anticipated filing, is the impelling cause. Advice to incur additional\ndebt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or make other purchases\n“reasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a\ndependent of the debtor,” §523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly permissible.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The parties agree, as do\nwe, that the challenged provisions regulate only commer\ncial speech. Milavetz contends that our decision in Cen\ntral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), supplies the proper standard\nfor reviewing these requirements. The Court in that case\nheld that restrictions on nonmisleading commercial speech\nregarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate\nscrutiny—that is, they must “directly advanc[e]” a sub\nstantial governmental interest and be “n[o] more extensive\nthan is necessary to serve that interest.” Id., at 566.\nContesting Milavetz’s premise, the Government maintains\nthat §528 is directed at misleading commercial speech.\nFor that reason, and because the challenged provisions\nimpose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirma\ntive limitation on speech, the Government contends that\nthe less exacting scrutiny described in Zauderer governs\nour review. We agree.\n   Zauderer addressed the validity of a rule of professional\nconduct that required attorneys who advertised contin\ngency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that\na losing client might still be responsible for certain litiga\n——————\n  7 In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate §528’s validity as\n\napplied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record.\nBecause the parties have introduced no exhibits or other evidence to\nground our analysis, we are guided in this preenforcement challenge\nonly by Milavetz’s status—i.e., as a law firm or attorney—and its\ngeneral claims about the nature of its advertisements.\n20     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntion fees and costs. Noting that First Amendment protec\ntion for commercial speech is justified in large part by the\ninformation’s value to consumers, the Court concluded\nthat an attorney’s constitutionally protected interest in not\nproviding the required factual information is “minimal.”\n471 U. S., at 651. Unjustified or unduly burdensome\ndisclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by\nchilling protected speech, but “an advertiser’s rights are\nadequately protected as long as disclosure requirements\nare reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing\ndeception of consumers.” Ibid.\n   The challenged provisions of §528 share the essential\nfeatures of the rule at issue in Zauderer. As in that case,\n§528’s required disclosures are intended to combat the\nproblem of inherently misleading commercial advertise\nments—specifically, the promise of debt relief without any\nreference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which\nhas inherent costs. Additionally, the disclosures entail\nonly an accurate statement identifying the advertiser’s\nlegal status and the character of the assistance provided,\nand they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz\nfrom conveying any additional information.\n   The same characteristics of §528 that make it analogous\nto the rule in Zauderer serve to distinguish it from those\nat issue in In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191 (1982), to which\nthe Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of Central\nHudson. The ethical rules addressed in R. M.

In so holding,\nthe Court emphasized that States retain authority to\nregulate inherently misleading advertisements, particu\nlarly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that\nadvertisements for professional services pose a special risk\nof deception. See id., at 203, 207.\n   Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government\nin these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that\nits advertisements are misleading. Zauderer forecloses\nthat argument: “When the possibility of deception is as\nself-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the\nState to ‘conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may]\ndetermine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to\nmislead.’ ” 471 U. S., at 652–653 (quoting FTC v. Colgate-\nPalmolive Co., 380 U. S. 374, 391–392 (1965)). Evidence\nin the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of\nadvertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief\nwithout alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998\nHearings, pt. III, at 86, 90–94, is adequate to establish\nthat the likelihood of deception in this case “is hardly a\nspeculative one,” 471 U. S., at 652.\n   Milavetz alternatively argues that the term “debt relief\nagency” is confusing and misleading and that requiring its\ninclusion in advertisements cannot be “reasonably related”\nto the Government’s interest in preventing consumer\ndeception, as Zauderer requires. Id., at 651. This conten\ntion amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz’s\npart for referring to itself as something other than a “debt\nrelief agency”—e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several\nreasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any consti\ntutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to sup\nport its claim that the label is confusing. Because §528 by\nits terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclo\nsures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt\nrelief agencies must identify themselves as such in their\n22     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P.

This statement provides interested ob\nservers with pertinent information about the advertiser’s\nservices and client obligations.\n   Other information that Milavetz must or may include in\nits advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services\nprovides additional assurance that consumers will not\nmisunderstand the term. The required statement that the\nadvertiser “ ‘help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief’ ” gives\nmeaningful context to the term “debt relief agency.” And\nMilavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attor\nney. Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor\nthe disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as\nthe resulting statements are “substantially similar” to the\nstatutory examples. §§528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).\n   Finally, we reject Milavetz’s argument that §528 is not\nreasonably related to any governmental interest because it\napplies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as\nMilavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Mi\nlavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading\nin that context. This claim is premised on an untenable\nreading of the statute. We think it evident from the defi\nnition of “assisted person”—which is stated in terms of the\nperson’s debts, see §101(3)—and from the text and struc\nture of the debt-relief-agency provisions in §§526, 527, and\n528 that those provisions, including §528’s disclosure\nrequirements, govern only professionals who offer bank\nruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528\nis itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertain\ning to “bankruptcy assistance services,” “the benefits of\nbankruptcy,” “excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or\ninability to pay any consumer debt,” §§528(a)(3) and (b)(2).\nMoreover, like the other debt-relief-agency provisions, that\nsection is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code\nentitled “DEBTOR’S DUTIES AND BENEFITS.”                      11\nU. S. C., ch. 5, subch. II. In context, reading §528 to gov\nern advertisements aimed at creditors would be as anoma\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Once\nagain, we decline Milavetz’s invitation to adopt a view of\nthe statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would\nproduce an absurd result.\n   Because §528’s requirements that Milavetz identify\nitself as a debt relief agency and include certain informa\ntion about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services\nare “reasonably related to the [Government’s] interest in\npreventing deception of consumers,” Zauderer, 471 U.

The Court first notes that\nstatements in the Report of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary “indicate concern with abusive practices under\ntaken by attorneys.” Ante, at 6, n. 3. Perhaps, but only\nthe concern of the author of the Report. Such statements\ntell us nothing about what the statute means, since (1) we\ndo not know that the members of the Committee read the\nReport, (2) it is almost certain that they did not vote on\nthe Report (that is not the practice), and (3) even if they\ndid read and vote on it, they were not, after all, those who\nmade this law. The statute before us is a law because its\ntext was approved by a majority vote of the House and the\nSenate, and was signed by the President. Even indulging\nthe extravagant assumption that Members of the House\n2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v.

And the President\nsurely had more important things to do.\n  The footnote’s other source of legislative history is truly\nmystifying. For the proposition that “the legislative record\nelsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys” which was\npresumably the concern of Congress, the Court cites a\nreproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an\nattachment to the written statement of a witness, (2) in a\nhearing held seven years prior to this statute’s passage,\n(3) before a subcommittee of the House considering a\ndifferent consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never\npassed.* “Elsewhere” indeed.\n  The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by\nthis superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is “unnec\nessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language,”\nante, at 6, n. 3). But much can be lost. Our cases have\nsaid that legislative history is irrelevant when the statu\ntory text is clear. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzales, 520\nU. S. 1, 6 (1997); Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992).

The page it cites,\nhowever, does nothing more than note that the earlier hearing took\nplace, see H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1, p. 7 (2005). Are we to believe\nthat this brought to the attention of the committee (much less of the\nwhole Congress) an attachment to the testimony of one of the witnesses\nat that long-ago hearing?

I agree with the Court that 11\nU. S. C. §528’s advertising disclosure requirements sur\nvive First Amendment scrutiny on the record before us. I\nwrite separately because different reasons lead me to that\nconclusion.\n  I have never been persuaded that there is any basis in\nthe First Amendment for the relaxed scrutiny this Court\napplies to laws that suppress nonmisleading commercial\nspeech. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.\n484, 522–523 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and con\ncurring in judgment) (discussing Central Hudson Gas &\nElec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557\n(1980)). In this case, the Court applies a still lower stan\ndard of scrutiny to review a law that compels the disclo\nsure of commercial speech—i.e., the rule articulated in\n2      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                   Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\nZauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme\nCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), that laws that require\nthe disclosure of factual information in commercial adver\ntising may be upheld so long as they are “reasonably\nrelated” to the government’s interest in preventing con\nsumer deception, id., at 651.\n   I am skeptical of the premise on which Zauderer rests—\nthat, in the commercial-speech context, “the First Amend\nment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are\nsubstantially weaker than those at stake when speech is\nactually suppressed,” id., at 652, n. 14; see id., at 650\n(citing “material differences between disclosure require\nments and outright prohibitions on speech”). We have\nrefused in other contexts to attach any “constitutional\nsignificance” to the difference between regulations that\ncompel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.\nSee, e.g., Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,\nInc., 487 U. S. 781, 796–797 (1988). I see no reason why\nthat difference should acquire constitutional significance\nmerely because the regulations at issue involve commer\ncial speech. See Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,\nInc., 521 U. S. 457, 480–481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(arguing that “commercial speech is . . . subject to [this]\nFirst Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable\nspeech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is\ntypically subject to the same level of scrutiny”); id., at 504\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. United Foods,\nInc., 533 U. S. 405, 419 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(stating that regulations that compel funding for commer\ncial advertising “must be subjected to the most stringent\nFirst Amendment scrutiny”).\n   Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine Zauderer\nand its progeny in an appropriate case to determine\nwhether these precedents provide sufficient First Amend\nment protection against government-mandated disclo\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See Borgner v.\nFlorida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud\nerer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor\nney under a rule of professional conduct that required\nadvertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose\nthat losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees\nand costs. See 471 U. S., at 650–653. Importantly, how\never, Zauderer’s advertisement was found to be misleading\non its face, and the regulation in that case did not man\ndate the specific form or text of the disclosure. Ibid. Thus,\nZauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov\nernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted\ndisclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in\n——————\n   1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are\n\nfalse or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be\nproscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520\n(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nFurthermore, I acknowledge this Court’s longstanding assumption that\na consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain\nfactual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on\nFirst Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver\ntisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,\n771–772 (1976); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme\nCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651–652, n. 14 (1985); Riley v. National\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796, n. 9 (1988);\nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447\nU. S. 557, 565 (1980). But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt\nthat it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations\nthat compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.\n4     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                  Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\npreventing consumer deception might plausibly be at\nstake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government\nthat a disclosure requirement is “intended” to prevent\nconsumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to\nuphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls\nwithin its sweep. See ante, at 20.\n   Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations\naimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissi\nble only where “the particular advertising is inherently\nlikely to deceive or where the record indicates that a par\nticular form or method of advertising has in fact been\ndeceptive.” In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 202 (1982) (em\nphasis added); see Zauderer, supra, at 651 (“recogniz[ing]\nthat unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\nquirements might offend the First Amendment”). There\nfore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional mus\nter only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements\nthat, by their nature, possess these traits. See R. M. J.,\nsupra, at 202; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and\nProfessional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S.\n136, 143, 146–147 (1994).\n   I do not read the Court’s opinion to hold otherwise. See\nante, at 20. Accordingly, and with that understanding, I\nturn to the question whether Milavetz’s challenge to\n§528’s disclosure requirements survives Zauderer scrutiny\non the record before us.\n   As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz’s challenge\ninhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See\nante, at 19, n. 7. Milavetz challenged §528’s constitution\nality before the statute had ever been enforced against any\nof the firm’s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports\nto challenge §528 only “ ‘as-applied’ ” to its own advertis\ning, see ante, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or\nexhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen\na sampling of Milavetz’s advertisements or even a declara\ntion describing their contents and the media through\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhich Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence,\nMilavetz’s nominal “as applied” challenge appears strik\ningly similar to a facial challenge.\n   We generally disapprove of such challenges because\nthey “often rest on speculation” and require courts to\nengage in “ ‘premature interpretation of statutes on the\nbasis of factually barebones records.’ ” Washington State\nGrange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.\n442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.\n600, 609 (2004)). Milavetz’s claim invites the same prob\nlems. Milavetz alleges that §528’s disclosure require\nments are unconstitutional as applied to its advertise\nments because its advertisements are not misleading and\nbecause the disclaimer required by §528 will create, rather\nthan reduce, confusion for Milavetz’s potential clients.\nThat may well be true. But because no record evidence of\nMilavetz’s advertisements exists to guide our review, we\ncan only speculate about the ways in which the statute\nmight be applied to Milavetz’s speech.\n   When forced to determine the constitutionality of a\nstatute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the\nlaw if there is any “conceivabl[e]” manner in which it can\nbe enforced consistent with the First Amendment. Wash\nington State Grange, supra, at 456. In this case, both\nparties agree that §528’s disclosure requirements cover, at\na minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to\n“ ‘wipe out’ ” debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the\nmeans of accomplishing this goal.2 Brief for Milavetz 82,\n——————\n  2 Atoral argument, Milavetz’s counsel declined to describe Milavetz’s\nchallenge to §528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25–26,\nand Milavetz’s briefs make no such contention. But even viewing\nMilavetz’s argument as a claim that §528 is facially overbroad because\nit applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related\nservices, such an argument must fail. First, as noted, Milavetz ac\nknowledges that §528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive\nbankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one “set of\n6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P.

That class includes, with limited exceptions, “any person\n  who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person . . . for\n  . . . payment . . . , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” Ibid.\n  The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from “advis[ing] an as\n  sisted person . . . to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for\n  bankruptcy] . . . .” §526(a)(4). It also requires them to disclose in\n  their advertisements for certain services that the services are with\n  respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, §§528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and\n  to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, §§528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).\n      The plaintiffs in this litigation—a law firm and others (collectively\n  Milavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, ar\n  guing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA’s debt-relief-agency\n  provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional\n  debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertise\n  ments. The District Court found that “debt relief agency” does not\n  include attorneys and that §§526 and 528 are unconstitutional as ap\n  plied to that class of professionals. The Eighth Circuit affirmed in\n  part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court’s conclusion\n  that attorneys are not “debt relief agenc[ies]”; upholding application\n  of §528’s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding §526(a)(4)\n  unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–1225, United States v.

UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    from advising assisted persons to incur any additional debt in con\n    templation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent\n    prebankruptcy planning.\nHeld:\n    1. Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons\n are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA. By definition, “bank\n ruptcy assistance” includes several services commonly performed by\n attorneys, e.g., providing “advice, counsel, [or] document prepara\n tion,” §101(4A). Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the\n debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude\n attorneys. See §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Milavetz relies on the fact that\n §101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a nar\n rower understanding. On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition\n preparer would qualify—an implausibility given that a “debt relief\n agency” is “any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance . . . or\n who is a bankruptcy petition preparer,” ibid. Milavetz’s other argu\n ments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive. Pp. 5–9.\n    2. Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advis\n ing a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bank\n ruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose. The statute’s language, to\n gether with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of §526(a)(4) the\n natural one. Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v. Pender, 289 U. S. 472, sup\n ports this conclusion. The Court in that case read now-repealed\n §96(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor’s attorney’s fees\n payment “in contemplation of the filing of a petition,” to require that\n the portended bankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, id.,\n at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.\n The Court identified the “controlling question” as “whether the\n thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction,”\n ibid.    Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d) and\n 526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise\n whether the impelling reason for “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to\n incur more debt” was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. In prac\n tice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of\n advice to “load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its dis\n charge.     The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n §526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct. The\n Court rejects Milavetz’s arguments for a more expansive view of\n §526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is\n impermissibly vague. Pp. 9–18.\n    3. Section 528’s disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Mi\n lavetz. Consistent with Milavetz’s characterization, the Court pre\n sumes that this is an as-applied challenge. Because §528 is directed\n at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure re\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Office of Disciplinary Counsel\n  of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs. There, the Court\n  found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\n  quirements offend the First Amendment, “an advertiser’s rights are\n  adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasona\n  bly related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consum\n  ers.” Id., at 651. Section 528’s requirements share the essential fea\n  tures of the rule challenged in Zauderer. The disclosures are\n  intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial\n  advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the\n  advertiser’s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.\n  Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying\n  any additional information through their advertisements. In re R. M.\n  J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished. Because §528’s requirements are\n  “reasonably related” to the Government’s interest in preventing con\n  sumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Mi\n  lavetz.

See 11 U. S. C.\n§§101(3), (12A). These consolidated cases present the\nthreshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agen\ncies when they provide qualifying services. Because we\nagree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must\nalso consider whether the Act’s provisions governing debt\nrelief agencies’ advice to clients, §526(a)(4), and requiring\nthem to make certain disclosures in their advertisements,\n2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n§§528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of\nattorneys. Concluding that the Court of Appeals con\nstrued §526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment\nthat the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like\nthe Court of Appeals, we uphold §528’s disclosure re\nquirements as applied in these consolidated cases.\n                              I\n   In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Con\ngress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provi\nsions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.\nSome of these measures apply to the broad class of bank\nruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].” That\ncategory includes, with limited exceptions, “any person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson in return for . . . payment . . . , or who is a bank\nruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A).1 “Bankruptcy assis\ntance” refers to goods or services “provided to an assisted\nperson with the express or implied purpose of providing\ninformation, advice, counsel, document preparation, or\nfiling, or attendance at a creditors’ meeting or appearing\nin a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing\nlegal representation with respect to a case or proceeding”\nin bankruptcy. §101(4A). An “assisted person” is someone\nwith limited nonexempt property whose debts consist\nprimarily of consumer debts. §101(3). The BAPCPA\nsubjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions\nand requirements, as set forth in §§526, 527, and 528. As\n——————\n   1 Congress excluded from the definition of “debt relief agency” any\n\n“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who provides [bank\nruptcy] assistance”; any “nonprofit organization that is exempt from\ntaxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986”;\n“a creditor of [an] assisted person” who is helping that person “to\nrestructure any debt owed . . . to the creditor”; “a depository institu\ntion”; or “an author, publisher, distributor, or seller of works subject to\ncopyright protection under title 17, when acting in such capacity.”\n§§101(12A)(A)–(E).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, §526(a) establishes several rules of profes\nsional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agen\ncies. Among them, §526(a)(4) states that a debt relief\nagency shall not “advise an assisted person . . . to incur\nmore debt in contemplation of such person filing a case\nunder this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy peti\ntion preparer fee or charge for services performed as part\nof preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under\nthis title.”\n   Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include\ncertain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection (a)\nprovides that debt relief agencies must “clearly and con\nspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy\nassistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy di\nrected to the general public . . . that the services or bene\nfits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.”\n§528(a)(3). It also requires them to include the following,\n“or a substantially similar statement”: “We are a debt\nrelief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief\nunder the Bankruptcy Code.” §528(a)(4). Subsection (b)\nrequires essentially the same disclosures in advertise\nments “indicating that the debt relief agency provides\nassistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage fore\nclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collec\ntion pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.”\n§528(b)(2). Debt relief agencies advertising such services\nmust disclose “that the assistance may involve bankruptcy\nrelief,” §528(b)(2)(A), and must identify themselves as\n“debt relief agenc[ies]” as required by §528(a)(4), see\n§528(b)(2)(B).\n                              II\n  The plaintiffs in this litigation—the law firm Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz, P. A.; the firm’s president, Robert J.\nMilavetz; a bankruptcy attorney at the firm, Barbara\nNilva Nevin; and two of the firm’s clients (collectively\n4      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nMilavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit in Federal District\nCourt seeking declaratory relief with respect to the Act’s\ndebt-relief-agency provisions. Milavetz asked the court to\nhold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may\nfreely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not\nidentify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.\n   Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not “debt relief\nagenc[ies]” as that term is used in the BAPCPA. In the\nalternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that §§526(a)(4)\nand 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to\nattorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that\nthe term “debt relief agency” does not include attorneys,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1119, p. A–15, but only\nafter finding that §§526 and 528—provisions expressly\napplicable only to debt relief agencies—are unconstitu\ntional as applied to this class of professionals.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. 541 F. 3d 785 (2008). Relying\non the Act’s plain language, the court unanimously re\njected the District Court’s conclusion that attorneys are\nnot “debt relief agenc[ies]” within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District\nCourt concerning the constitutionality of §528. Conclud\ning that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer\ndeception and are “reasonably related” to that interest, the\ncourt upheld the application of §528’s disclosure require\nments to attorneys. Id., at 796–797 (citing Zauderer v.\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,\n471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985)).\n   A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed\nwith the District Court that §526(a)(4) is invalid. Deter\nmining that §526(a)(4) “broadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy,” even when that advice constitutes prudent\nprebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bank\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nruptcy laws, 541 F. 3d, at 793, the majority held that\n§526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermedi\nate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that\n§526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice\nto abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construc\ntion would avoid most constitutional difficulties. See id.,\nat 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,2 we\ngranted certiorari to resolve the question of §526(a)(4)’s\nscope. 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We also agreed to consider\nthe threshold question whether attorneys who provide\nbankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are “debt relief\nagenc[ies]” within the meaning of §101(12A) and the re\nlated question whether §528’s disclosure requirements are\nconstitutional.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  We first consider whether the term “debt relief agency”\nincludes attorneys. If it does not, we need not reach the\nother questions presented, as §§526 and 528 govern only\nthe conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz chal\nlenges the validity of those provisions based on their\napplication to attorneys. The Government contends that\n“debt relief agency” plainly includes attorneys, while\nMilavetz urges that it does not. We conclude that the\nGovernment has the better view.\n  As already noted, a debt relief agency is “any person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson” in return for payment. §101(12A). By definition,\n“bankruptcy assistance” includes several services com\n——————\n  2 Compare 541 F. 3d 785, 794 (CA8 2008) (case below), with Hersh v.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Mukasey, 553 F. 3d 743, 761, 764 (CA5 2008)\n(holding that §526(a)(4) can be narrowly construed to prohibit only\nadvice to abuse or manipulate the bankruptcy system and that, so\nconstrued, it is constitutional).\n6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nmonly performed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of\nbankruptcy assistance, including the “provi[sion of] legal\nrepresentation with respect to a case or proceeding,”\n§101(4A), may be provided only by attorneys.             See\n§110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from\nproviding legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating specific\nexceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress\ngave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.\nSee §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Thus, as the Government con\ntends, the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys\nare debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying\nservices to assisted persons.3\n  In advocating a narrower understanding of that term,\nMilavetz relies heavily on the fact that §101(12A) does not\nexpressly include attorneys. That omission stands in\ncontrast, it argues, to the provision’s explicit inclusion of\n“bankruptcy petition preparer[s]”—a category of profes\nsionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see\n§110(a)(1). But Milavetz does not contend, nor could it\ncredibly, that only professionals expressly included in the\ndefinition are debt relief agencies. On that reading, no\nprofessional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer\nwould qualify—an implausible reading given that the\nstatute defines “debt relief agency” as “any person who\n——————\n   3 Although reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of\n\nthe statute’s unambiguous language, we note the support that record\nprovides for the Government’s reading. Statements in a Report of the\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Act’s purpose indicate\nconcern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys as well as\nother bankruptcy professionals. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1,\np. 5 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the legislative record else\nwhere documents misconduct by attorneys. See, e.g., Hearing on H. R.\n3150 before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law\nof the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. III,\np. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998 Hearings). (While the 1998 Hearings\npreceded the BAPCPA’s enactment by several years, they form part of\nthe record cited by the 2005 House Report. See H. R. Rep., at 7.)\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person\n. . . or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A)\n(emphasis added). The provision’s silence regarding at\ntorneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf. Heintz v. Jenkins,\n514 U. S. 291, 294 (1995) (holding that “debt collector” as\nused in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S. C.\n§1692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the defini\ntion’s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).\n    Milavetz’s other arguments for excluding attorneys\nsimilarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute’s\nplain language.       Milavetz contends that 11 U. S. C.\n§526(d)(2)’s instruction that §§526, 527, and 528 should\nnot “be deemed to limit or curtail” States’ authority to\n“determine and enforce qualifications for the practice of\nlaw” counsels against reading “debt relief agency” to in\nclude attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States’\nrole in regulating the legal profession is to make the\nBAPCPA’s professional conduct rules inapplicable to\nlawyers. We find that §526(d)(2) supports the opposite\nconclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact\nthat provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not\napply to attorneys. Milavetz’s broader claim that reading\n§101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on\nan area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.\nCongress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen\naspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial\nfederal concern. See, e.g., Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v.\nPender, 289 U. S. 472, 477–479 (1933) (finding broad\nauthorization in former §96(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978)\nfor courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor’s\nprepetition attorney’s fees).\n    Milavetz next argues that §101(12A)’s exception for any\n“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who pro\nvides” bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to\ninclude “partners.” §101(12A)(A). In light of that omis\nsion, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies\n8       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwill obligate entire law firms to comply with §§526, 527,\nand 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while\nthe agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typi\ncally organized as partnerships are shielded from those\nrequirements. Given that the partnership structure is not\nunique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclu\nsion would be revealing of Congress’ intent only with\nrespect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are them\nselves “person[s]” under the BAPCPA, see §101(41), and\ncan qualify as “debt relief agenc[ies]” when they meet the\ncriteria set forth in §101(12A). Moreover, a partnership’s\nemployees and agents are exempted from §101(12A) in the\nsame way as the employees and agents of other organiza\ntions. To the extent that partners may be subject to the\ndebt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is\nconsistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow\nfrom the partnership structure, cf. Strang v. Bradner, 114\nU. S. 555, 561 (1885). Accordingly, we decline to attribute\nthe significance Milavetz suggests to §101(12A)(A)’s fail\nure to include partners among the exempted actors.4\n   All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of consti\ntutional avoidance requires us to read “debt relief agency”\n——————\n  4 Reviving an argument that Milavetz abandoned, amici contend that\n\n§527(b) undermines the Government’s reading of §101(12A) because it\nrequires a debt relief agency to inform an assisted person of his right to\nhire an attorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to\nprovide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34. This argument fails\non its own terms. Even if §101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz\ncontends, §527(b) would still produce the result of which its amici\ncomplain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform\nassisted persons that they “ ‘can get help in some localities from a\nbankruptcy petition preparer,’ ” and there is no question that bank\nruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to\nthat requirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief\nagencies—whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers—to\ninform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy\nassistance services.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto exclude attorneys in order to forestall serious doubts as\nto the validity of §§526 and 528. The avoidance canon,\nhowever, “is a tool for choosing between competing plausi\nble interpretations of a statutory text.” Clark v. Martinez,\n543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005). In applying that tool, we will\nconsider only those constructions of a statute that are\n“ ‘fairly possible.’ ” United States v. Security Industrial\nBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). For the reasons already\ndiscussed, the text and statutory context of §101(12A)\nforeclose a reading of “debt relief agency” that excludes\nattorneys. Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who pro\nvide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt\nrelief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.\n                              B\n   Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies\nwhen they provide qualifying services, we next address the\nscope and validity of §526(a)(4). Characterizing the stat\nute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client\ncommunications that is not adequately tailored to con\nstrain only speech the Government has a substantial\ninterest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule\nsubstantially overbroad. 541 F. 3d, at 793–794, and n. 10.\nFor the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.\n   Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from\n“advis[ing] an assisted person” either “to incur more debt\nin contemplation of” filing for bankruptcy “or to pay an\nattorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for\nservices” performed in preparation for filing. Only the\nfirst of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the\ncorrectness of the Court of Appeals’ decision, the parties\nfirst dispute the provision’s scope. The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that “§526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy.” Id., at 793. Under that reading, an attorney\n10     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nis prohibited from providing all manner of “beneficial\nadvice—even if the advice could help the assisted person\navoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.” Ibid.\n   Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, Milavetz contends\nthat §526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from advising\na client to incur any new debt while considering whether\nto file for bankruptcy. Construing the provision more\nbroadly still, Milavetz contends that §526(a)(4) forbids not\nonly affirmative advice but also any discussion of the\nadvantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more\ndebt. Like the panel majority’s, Milavetz’s reading rests\nprimarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the\nphrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy encompasses any\nadvice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might\nsoon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate\nthe need to file. Milavetz also maintains that if §526(a)(4)\nwere construed more narrowly, as urged by the Govern\nment and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to\ninevitably chill some protected speech.\n   The Government continues to advocate a narrower\nconstruction of the statute, urging that Milavetz’s reading\nis untenable and that its vagueness concerns are mis\nplaced. The Government contends that §526(a)(4)’s re\nstriction on advice to incur more debt “in contemplation of”\nbankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to\nundertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system. Focus\ning first on the provision’s text, the Government points to\nsources indicating that the phrase “in contemplation of”\nbankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated\nwith abusive conduct. For instance, Black’s Law Diction\nary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “con\ntemplation of bankruptcy” as “[t]he thought of declaring\nbankruptcy because of the inability to continue current\nfinancial operations, often coupled with action designed to\nthwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceed\ning.” Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illus\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrates that traditional coupling. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 98–\n65, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of “ ‘loading up’ [on\ndebt] in contemplation of bankruptcy”); Report of the\nCommission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States,\nH. R. Doc. No. 93–137, pt. I, p. 11 (1973) (“[T]he most\nserious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of\ninstances in which individuals have purchased a sizable\nquantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of\nbankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge”).\nThe Government also points to early American and Eng\nlish judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that “in\ncontemplation of” bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct.\nSee, e.g., In re Pearce, 19 F. Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt.\n1843); Morgan v. Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296–297, 110\nEng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).\n   To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on\n§526(a)(4)’s immediate context. According to the Govern\nment, the other three subsections of §526(a) are designed\nto protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief\nagencies: §526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to per\nform all promised services; §526(a)(2) prohibits them from\nmaking or advising debtors to make false or misleading\nstatements in bankruptcy; and §526(a)(3) prohibits them\nfrom misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of\nbankruptcy. When §526(a)(4) is read in context of these\ndebtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,\nconstruing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving\nadvice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors\nseems particularly nonsensical.\n   Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA’s\nremedies for violations of §526(a)(4) similarly corroborate\nits narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies for a\ndebt relief agency’s violation of §526, §527, or §528.\nAmong the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the at\ntorney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable\nattorney’s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue\n12    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nfor a resident’s actual damages; and a court finding inten\ntional abuse may impose an appropriate civil penalty.\n§526(c). The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit’s\ndecision in Hersh v. United States ex rel. Mukasey, 553\nF. 3d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton’s dissent below for\nthe observation that “Congress’s emphasis on actual dam\nages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests\nthat Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to\ndebtors which if followed would have a significant risk of\nharming the debtor.” Id., at 760; see 541 F. 3d, at 800\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By\ncontrast, “legal and appropriate advice that would be\nprotected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a\nbroad reading of §526(a)(4), should cause no damage at\nall.” Ibid.; see Hersh, 541 F. 3d, at 760.\n   Milavetz contends that the Government’s sources actu\nally undermine its claim that the phrase “in contemplation\nof” bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct.\nSpecifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities illus\ntrate that “in contemplation of” bankruptcy is a neutral\nphrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to\nan additional, proscriptive term. As Black’s states, the\nphrase is “often coupled with action designed to thwart the\ndistribution of assets” in bankruptcy, Black’s 336 (empha\nsis added), but it carries no independent connotation of\nabuse. In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on\nour decision in Pender, 289 U. S. 472, contending that we\nconstrued “in contemplation of” bankruptcy in that case to\ndescribe “conduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy\nfiling and nothing more.” Brief for Milavetz 61.\n   After reviewing these competing claims, we are per\nsuaded that a narrower reading of §526(a)(4) is sounder,\nalthough we do not adopt precisely the view the Govern\nment advocates. The Government’s sources show that the\nphrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy has so commonly\nbeen associated with abusive conduct that it may readily\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe understood to prefigure abuse. As used in §526(a)(4),\nhowever, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of\nmisconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the\nbankruptcy system. In light of our decision in Pender, and\nin context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that\n§526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising\na debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for\nbankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.\n    Pender addressed the meaning of former §96(d), which\nauthorized reexamination of a debtor’s payment of attor\nney’s fees “in contemplation of the filing of a petition.”\nRecognizing “ ‘the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too\nliberally with his property in enabling counsel to protect\nhim,’ ” 289 U. S., at 478 (quoting In re Wood & Henderson,\n210 U. S. 246, 253 (1908)), we read “in contemplation of\n. . . filing” in that context to require that the portended\nbankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, 289\nU. S., at 477, understanding inducement to engender\nsuspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we identi\nfied the “controlling question” as “whether the thought of\nbankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.”\nIbid. Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d)\nand 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the\nlatter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason\nfor “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to incur more debt”\nwas the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.\n    To be sure, there are relevant differences between the\nprovision at issue in Pender and the one now under re\nview. Most notably, the inquiry in Pender was as to pay\nments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas §526(a)(4)\nregards advice to incur additional debts. Consistent with\nthat difference, under §96(d) a finding that a payment was\nmade “in contemplation of” filing resolved only a threshold\ninquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of\nthe payment; the finding thus supported an inference of\nabuse but did not conclusively establish it. By contrast,\n14    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadvice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as pro\nhibited by §526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to\n“load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its\ndischarge—i.e., conduct that is abusive per se.\n   The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n§526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of\nabuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already\nsought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior\nto filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the\nattendant risk of manipulation by preventing the dis\ncharge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making\ndebts for purchases of luxury goods or services presump\ntively nondischargeable. See §§523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000\ned.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, how\never, by providing a new mechanism for determining a\ndebtor’s ability to repay. Pursuant to the “means tes[t],”\n§707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor’s petition for Chapter 7\nrelief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dis\nmissed or converted to a structured repayment plan under\nChapter 13) if the debtor’s current monthly income ex\nceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including pay\nments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed\namount. See §§707(b)(2)(A)(i)–(iv). The test promotes\ndebtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur\nadditional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured\ndebts offset a debtor’s monthly income under the formula.\nOther amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a\nconcern with this practice.        For instance, Congress\namended §523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge\nby lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor\nmust assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under\n§523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling win\ndow. See §310, 119 Stat. 84. In context, §526(a)(4) is best\nunderstood to provide an additional safeguard against the\npractice of loading up on debt prior to filing.\n   The Government’s contextual arguments provide addi\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional support for the view that §526(a)(4) was meant to\nprevent this type of conduct. The companion rules of\nprofessional conduct in §§526(a)(1)–(3) and the remedies\nfor their violation in §526(c) indicate that Congress was\nconcerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or\ncreditors. Unlike the reasonable financial advice the\nEighth Circuit’s broad reading would proscribe, advice to\nincur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a sub\nstantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors. See\nHersh, 553 F. 3d, at 760–761. Specifically, the incurrence\nof such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition\nconduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargable,\nsee §523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or\ndismiss it altogether, see §707(b), thereby defeating his\neffort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although\nmanipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abu\nsive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm\nas a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of\nthe bankruptcy estate. By contrast, the prudent advice\nthat the Eighth Circuit’s view of the statute forbids would\nlikely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very\nleast should cause no harm. See id., at 760; 541 F. 3d, at\n800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). For all of these reasons, we conclude that §526(a)(4)\nprohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an as\nsisted person to incur more debt when the impelling rea\nson for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\n   That “[n]o other solution yields as sensible a” result\nfurther persuades us of the correctness of this narrow\nreading. United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 55\n(1994). It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys\nand other debt relief agencies from advising individuals\nthinking of filing for bankruptcy about options that would\nbe beneficial to both those individuals and their creditors.\nThat construction serves none of the purposes of the Bank\nruptcy Code or the amendments enacted through the\n16      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBAPCPA. Milavetz itself acknowledges that its expansive\nview of §526(a)(4) would produce absurd results; that is\none of its bases for arguing that “debt relief agency” should\nbe construed to exclude attorneys. Because the language\nand context of §526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted pur\npose, we can avoid the absurdity of which Milavetz com\nplains without reaching the result it advocates.\n   For the same reason, we reject Milavetz’s suggestion\nthat §526(a)(4) broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from\ndiscussing covered subjects instead of merely proscribing\naffirmative advice to undertake a particular action. Sec\ntion 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies\nonly from “advis[ing]” assisted persons “to incur” more\ndebt. Covered professionals remain free to “tal[k] fully\nand candidly about the incurrence of debt in contempla\ntion of filing a bankruptcy case.” Brief for Milavetz 73.\nSection 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid\ninstructing or encouraging assisted persons to take on\nmore debt in that circumstance. Cf. ABA Model Rule of\nProfessional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (“A lawyer shall not\ncounsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct\nthat the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a\nlawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any pro\nposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or\nassist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the\nvalidity, scope, meaning or application of the law”). Even\nif the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach\nthe same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition\nof frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within\nthe statutory scheme. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 529\nU. S. 694, 706, n. 9 (2000).5\n——————\n   5 If read as Milavetz advocates, §526(a)(4) would seriously undermine\n\nthe attorney-client relationship. Earlier this Term, we acknowledged\nthe importance of the attorney-client privilege as a means of protecting\nthat relationship and fostering robust discussion. See Mohawk Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7). Reiter\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Milavetz\nurges that the concept of abusive prefiling conduct is too\nindefinite to withstand constitutional scrutiny and that\nuncertainty regarding the scope of the prohibition will\nchill protected speech. We disagree.\n   Under our reading of the statute, of course, the prohib\nited advice is not defined in terms of abusive prefiling\nconduct but rather the incurrence of additional debt when\nthe impelling reason is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\nEven if the test depended upon the notion of abuse, how\never, Milavetz’s claim would be fatally undermined by\nother provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which that\nconcept is no stranger. As discussed above, the Code\nauthorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge\nfraudulent debts, see §523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or\nconvert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that\ngranting relief would constitute abuse, see §707(b)(1).\nAttorneys and other professionals who give debtors bank\nruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their\nconsequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs addi\ntional debt prior to filing. Indeed, §707(b)(4)(C) states that\nan attorney’s signature on bankruptcy filings “shall consti\ntute a certification that the attorney has” determined that\nthe filing “does not constitute an abuse under [§707(b)(1)].”\nAgainst this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that\nnarrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising\na client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct\ncould chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client\nrelationship. Our construction of §526(a)(4) to prevent\nonly advice principally motivated by the prospect of bank\n\n—————— \n\nating the significance of such dialogue, we note that §526(a)(4), as\n\nnarrowly construed, presents no impediment to “ ‘full and frank’ ” \n\ndiscussions. Ibid. (quoting Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383,\n\n389 (1981)). \n\n18      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v.

Accordingly, we reject\nthe Eighth Circuit’s conclusion and hold that a debt relief\nagency violates §526(a)(4) only when the impetus of the\nadvice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for\nbankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief. Because\nour reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for\nreversing the Court of Appeals’ decision, and because\nMilavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as\nnarrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further\nconsider whether the statute so construed withstands\nFirst Amendment scrutiny.\n                          C\n  Finally, we address the validity of §528’s challenged\ndisclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving this\n——————\n  6 The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits regarding the permissi\n\nbility of advice to incur debt in certain circumstances, see Brief for\nMilavetz 48–51, are easily answered by reference to whether the\nexpectation of filing for bankruptcy (and obtaining a discharge) im\npelled the advice. We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of\nbankruptcy is insufficient to trigger §526(a)(4)’s prohibition. Instead,\nthat provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is princi\npally motivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mort\ngage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will\nreduce the debtor’s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not\nprohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than\nthe anticipated filing, is the impelling cause. Advice to incur additional\ndebt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or make other purchases\n“reasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a\ndependent of the debtor,” §523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly permissible.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The parties agree, as do\nwe, that the challenged provisions regulate only commer\ncial speech. Milavetz contends that our decision in Cen\ntral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), supplies the proper standard\nfor reviewing these requirements. The Court in that case\nheld that restrictions on nonmisleading commercial speech\nregarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate\nscrutiny—that is, they must “directly advanc[e]” a sub\nstantial governmental interest and be “n[o] more extensive\nthan is necessary to serve that interest.” Id., at 566.\nContesting Milavetz’s premise, the Government maintains\nthat §528 is directed at misleading commercial speech.\nFor that reason, and because the challenged provisions\nimpose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirma\ntive limitation on speech, the Government contends that\nthe less exacting scrutiny described in Zauderer governs\nour review. We agree.\n   Zauderer addressed the validity of a rule of professional\nconduct that required attorneys who advertised contin\ngency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that\na losing client might still be responsible for certain litiga\n——————\n  7 In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate §528’s validity as\n\napplied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record.\nBecause the parties have introduced no exhibits or other evidence to\nground our analysis, we are guided in this preenforcement challenge\nonly by Milavetz’s status—i.e., as a law firm or attorney—and its\ngeneral claims about the nature of its advertisements.\n20     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P.

Noting that First Amendment protec\ntion for commercial speech is justified in large part by the\ninformation’s value to consumers, the Court concluded\nthat an attorney’s constitutionally protected interest in not\nproviding the required factual information is “minimal.”\n471 U. S., at 651. Unjustified or unduly burdensome\ndisclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by\nchilling protected speech, but “an advertiser’s rights are\nadequately protected as long as disclosure requirements\nare reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing\ndeception of consumers.” Ibid.\n   The challenged provisions of §528 share the essential\nfeatures of the rule at issue in Zauderer. As in that case,\n§528’s required disclosures are intended to combat the\nproblem of inherently misleading commercial advertise\nments—specifically, the promise of debt relief without any\nreference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which\nhas inherent costs. Additionally, the disclosures entail\nonly an accurate statement identifying the advertiser’s\nlegal status and the character of the assistance provided,\nand they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz\nfrom conveying any additional information.\n   The same characteristics of §528 that make it analogous\nto the rule in Zauderer serve to distinguish it from those\nat issue in In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191 (1982), to which\nthe Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of Central\nHudson. The ethical rules addressed in R. M. J. prohib\nited attorneys from advertising their practice areas in\nterms other than those prescribed by the State Supreme\nCourt and from announcing the courts in which they were\nadmitted to practice. See 455 U. S., at 197–198. Finding\nthat the restricted statements were not inherently mis\nleading and that the State had failed to show that the\nappellant’s advertisements were themselves likely to\nmislead consumers, see id., at 205, the Court applied\nCentral Hudson’s intermediate scrutiny and invalidated\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe restrictions as insufficiently tailored to any substan\ntial state interest, 455 U. S., at 205–206. In so holding,\nthe Court emphasized that States retain authority to\nregulate inherently misleading advertisements, particu\nlarly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that\nadvertisements for professional services pose a special risk\nof deception. See id., at 203, 207.\n   Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government\nin these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that\nits advertisements are misleading. Zauderer forecloses\nthat argument: “When the possibility of deception is as\nself-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the\nState to ‘conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may]\ndetermine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to\nmislead.’ ” 471 U. S., at 652–653 (quoting FTC v. Colgate-\nPalmolive Co., 380 U. S. 374, 391–392 (1965)). Evidence\nin the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of\nadvertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief\nwithout alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998\nHearings, pt. III, at 86, 90–94, is adequate to establish\nthat the likelihood of deception in this case “is hardly a\nspeculative one,” 471 U. S., at 652.\n   Milavetz alternatively argues that the term “debt relief\nagency” is confusing and misleading and that requiring its\ninclusion in advertisements cannot be “reasonably related”\nto the Government’s interest in preventing consumer\ndeception, as Zauderer requires. Id., at 651. This conten\ntion amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz’s\npart for referring to itself as something other than a “debt\nrelief agency”—e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several\nreasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any consti\ntutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to sup\nport its claim that the label is confusing. Because §528 by\nits terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclo\nsures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt\nrelief agencies must identify themselves as such in their\n22     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED\n                         STATES\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nadvertisements. This statement provides interested ob\nservers with pertinent information about the advertiser’s\nservices and client obligations.\n   Other information that Milavetz must or may include in\nits advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services\nprovides additional assurance that consumers will not\nmisunderstand the term. The required statement that the\nadvertiser “ ‘help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief’ ” gives\nmeaningful context to the term “debt relief agency.” And\nMilavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attor\nney. Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor\nthe disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as\nthe resulting statements are “substantially similar” to the\nstatutory examples. §§528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).\n   Finally, we reject Milavetz’s argument that §528 is not\nreasonably related to any governmental interest because it\napplies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as\nMilavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Mi\nlavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading\nin that context. This claim is premised on an untenable\nreading of the statute. We think it evident from the defi\nnition of “assisted person”—which is stated in terms of the\nperson’s debts, see §101(3)—and from the text and struc\nture of the debt-relief-agency provisions in §§526, 527, and\n528 that those provisions, including §528’s disclosure\nrequirements, govern only professionals who offer bank\nruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528\nis itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertain\ning to “bankruptcy assistance services,” “the benefits of\nbankruptcy,” “excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or\ninability to pay any consumer debt,” §§528(a)(3) and (b)(2).\nMoreover, like the other debt-relief-agency provisions, that\nsection is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code\nentitled “DEBTOR’S DUTIES AND BENEFITS.”                      11\nU. S. C., ch. 5, subch. II. In context, reading §528 to gov\nern advertisements aimed at creditors would be as anoma\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Once\nagain, we decline Milavetz’s invitation to adopt a view of\nthe statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would\nproduce an absurd result.\n   Because §528’s requirements that Milavetz identify\nitself as a debt relief agency and include certain informa\ntion about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services\nare “reasonably related to the [Government’s] interest in\npreventing deception of consumers,” Zauderer, 471 U. S.,\nat 651, we uphold those provisions as applied to Milavetz.\n                            IV\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed as to §§101(12A)\nand 528 and reversed as to §526(a)(4), and the cases are\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The Court first notes that\nstatements in the Report of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary “indicate concern with abusive practices under\ntaken by attorneys.” Ante, at 6, n. 3. Perhaps, but only\nthe concern of the author of the Report. Such statements\ntell us nothing about what the statute means, since (1) we\ndo not know that the members of the Committee read the\nReport, (2) it is almost certain that they did not vote on\nthe Report (that is not the practice), and (3) even if they\ndid read and vote on it, they were not, after all, those who\nmade this law. The statute before us is a law because its\ntext was approved by a majority vote of the House and the\nSenate, and was signed by the President. Even indulging\nthe extravagant assumption that Members of the House\n2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v.

And the President\nsurely had more important things to do.\n  The footnote’s other source of legislative history is truly\nmystifying. For the proposition that “the legislative record\nelsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys” which was\npresumably the concern of Congress, the Court cites a\nreproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an\nattachment to the written statement of a witness, (2) in a\nhearing held seven years prior to this statute’s passage,\n(3) before a subcommittee of the House considering a\ndifferent consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never\npassed.* “Elsewhere” indeed.\n  The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by\nthis superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is “unnec\nessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language,”\nante, at 6, n. 3). But much can be lost. Our cases have\nsaid that legislative history is irrelevant when the statu\ntory text is clear. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzales, 520\nU. S. 1, 6 (1997); Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992). The footnote advises conscientious\nattorneys that this is not true, and that they must spend\ntime and their clients’ treasure combing the annals of\nlegislative history in all cases: To buttress their case\n——————\n   * The Court protests that the earlier hearing was “part of the record\ncited by the 2005 House Report,” ante, at 6, n. 3. The page it cites,\nhowever, does nothing more than note that the earlier hearing took\nplace, see H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1, p. 7 (2005). Are we to believe\nthat this brought to the attention of the committee (much less of the\nwhole Congress) an attachment to the testimony of one of the witnesses\nat that long-ago hearing? Of course not. That legislative history shows\nwhat “Congress” intended is a fiction requiring no support in reality.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

I agree with the Court that 11\nU. S. C. §528’s advertising disclosure requirements sur\nvive First Amendment scrutiny on the record before us. I\nwrite separately because different reasons lead me to that\nconclusion.\n  I have never been persuaded that there is any basis in\nthe First Amendment for the relaxed scrutiny this Court\napplies to laws that suppress nonmisleading commercial\nspeech. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.\n484, 522–523 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and con\ncurring in judgment) (discussing Central Hudson Gas &\nElec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557\n(1980)). In this case, the Court applies a still lower stan\ndard of scrutiny to review a law that compels the disclo\nsure of commercial speech—i.e., the rule articulated in\n2      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                   Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\nZauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme\nCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985), that laws that require\nthe disclosure of factual information in commercial adver\ntising may be upheld so long as they are “reasonably\nrelated” to the government’s interest in preventing con\nsumer deception, id., at 651.\n   I am skeptical of the premise on which Zauderer rests—\nthat, in the commercial-speech context, “the First Amend\nment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are\nsubstantially weaker than those at stake when speech is\nactually suppressed,” id., at 652, n. 14; see id., at 650\n(citing “material differences between disclosure require\nments and outright prohibitions on speech”). We have\nrefused in other contexts to attach any “constitutional\nsignificance” to the difference between regulations that\ncompel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.\nSee, e.g., Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,\nInc., 487 U. S. 781, 796–797 (1988). I see no reason why\nthat difference should acquire constitutional significance\nmerely because the regulations at issue involve commer\ncial speech. See Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,\nInc., 521 U. S. 457, 480–481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(arguing that “commercial speech is . . . subject to [this]\nFirst Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable\nspeech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is\ntypically subject to the same level of scrutiny”); id., at 504\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. United Foods,\nInc., 533 U. S. 405, 419 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(stating that regulations that compel funding for commer\ncial advertising “must be subjected to the most stringent\nFirst Amendment scrutiny”).\n   Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine Zauderer\nand its progeny in an appropriate case to determine\nwhether these precedents provide sufficient First Amend\nment protection against government-mandated disclo\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See Borgner v.\nFlorida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud\nerer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor\nney under a rule of professional conduct that required\nadvertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose\nthat losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees\nand costs. See 471 U. S., at 650–653. Importantly, how\never, Zauderer’s advertisement was found to be misleading\non its face, and the regulation in that case did not man\ndate the specific form or text of the disclosure. Ibid. Thus,\nZauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov\nernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted\ndisclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in\n——————\n   1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are\n\nfalse or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be\nproscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520\n(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nFurthermore, I acknowledge this Court’s longstanding assumption that\na consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain\nfactual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on\nFirst Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver\ntisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,\n771–772 (1976); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme\nCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651–652, n. 14 (1985); Riley v. National\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796, n. 9 (1988);\nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447\nU. S. 557, 565 (1980). But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt\nthat it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations\nthat compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.\n4     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                  Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\npreventing consumer deception might plausibly be at\nstake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government\nthat a disclosure requirement is “intended” to prevent\nconsumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to\nuphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls\nwithin its sweep. See ante, at 20.\n   Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations\naimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissi\nble only where “the particular advertising is inherently\nlikely to deceive or where the record indicates that a par\nticular form or method of advertising has in fact been\ndeceptive.” In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 202 (1982) (em\nphasis added); see Zauderer, supra, at 651 (“recogniz[ing]\nthat unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\nquirements might offend the First Amendment”). There\nfore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional mus\nter only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements\nthat, by their nature, possess these traits. See R. M. J.,\nsupra, at 202; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and\nProfessional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S.\n136, 143, 146–147 (1994).\n   I do not read the Court’s opinion to hold otherwise. See\nante, at 20. Accordingly, and with that understanding, I\nturn to the question whether Milavetz’s challenge to\n§528’s disclosure requirements survives Zauderer scrutiny\non the record before us.\n   As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz’s challenge\ninhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See\nante, at 19, n. 7. Milavetz challenged §528’s constitution\nality before the statute had ever been enforced against any\nof the firm’s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports\nto challenge §528 only “ ‘as-applied’ ” to its own advertis\ning, see ante, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or\nexhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen\na sampling of Milavetz’s advertisements or even a declara\ntion describing their contents and the media through\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhich Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence,\nMilavetz’s nominal “as applied” challenge appears strik\ningly similar to a facial challenge.\n   We generally disapprove of such challenges because\nthey “often rest on speculation” and require courts to\nengage in “ ‘premature interpretation of statutes on the\nbasis of factually barebones records.’ ” Washington State\nGrange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.\n442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.\n600, 609 (2004)). Milavetz’s claim invites the same prob\nlems. Milavetz alleges that §528’s disclosure require\nments are unconstitutional as applied to its advertise\nments because its advertisements are not misleading and\nbecause the disclaimer required by §528 will create, rather\nthan reduce, confusion for Milavetz’s potential clients.\nThat may well be true. But because no record evidence of\nMilavetz’s advertisements exists to guide our review, we\ncan only speculate about the ways in which the statute\nmight be applied to Milavetz’s speech.\n   When forced to determine the constitutionality of a\nstatute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the\nlaw if there is any “conceivabl[e]” manner in which it can\nbe enforced consistent with the First Amendment. Wash\nington State Grange, supra, at 456. In this case, both\nparties agree that §528’s disclosure requirements cover, at\na minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to\n“ ‘wipe out’ ” debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the\nmeans of accomplishing this goal.2 Brief for Milavetz 82,\n——————\n  2 Atoral argument, Milavetz’s counsel declined to describe Milavetz’s\nchallenge to §528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25–26,\nand Milavetz’s briefs make no such contention. But even viewing\nMilavetz’s argument as a claim that §528 is facially overbroad because\nit applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related\nservices, such an argument must fail. First, as noted, Milavetz ac\nknowledges that §528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive\nbankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one “set of\n6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P.

As a result, there is at\nleast one set of facts on which the statute could be consti\ntutionally applied.
