UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013728.     Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 8, 2010\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendant\u2019s trial\n  to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance,\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\n  that deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). As relevant here, the Act\n  automatically excludes from the 70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from\n  . . . proceedings concerning the defendant,\u201d 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a73161(h)(1)\n  (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court\n  to exclude \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance\u201d it grants, provided\n  the court makes findings required by \u00a73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsec\n  tion (h)(7)). Petitioner\u2019s indictment on federal firearm and drug pos\n  session charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006. After\n  petitioner\u2019s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to\n  file pretrial motions by September 13. On September 7, the court\n  granted petitioner\u2019s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new\n  due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial\n  motions. On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver vol\n  untary and intelligent. Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial\n  was delayed several times, often at petitioner\u2019s instigation. On Feb\n  ruary 19, 2007\u2014179 days after he was indicted\u2014he moved to dismiss\n  the indictment, claiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. In\n  denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from Sep\n  tember 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time. At\n  trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to\n  concurrent prison terms. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of\n  the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7\n  through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day\n  limit under subsection (h)(1).\nHeld: The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically\n2                      BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1). Such time\n    may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance\n    based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7). Pp. 6\u201318.\n       (a) The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinaf\n    ter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders auto\n    matically excludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\n    the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\n    other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d This provision communi\n    cates Congress\u2019 judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is auto\n    matically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed\n    through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pre\n    trial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continu\n    ance under subsection (h)(7). This limitation is significant because\n    Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s\n    enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired. Although the pe\n    riod of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results\n    from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period pre\n    cedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay\n    may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically exclud\n    able. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry be\n    cause \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here, subparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s]\n    of more general application\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).\n    Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. A contrary result\n    would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the pro\n    priety of this Court\u2019s approach. Subsection (h)(1)\u2019s phrase \u201cincluding\n    but not limited to\u201d does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits auto\n    matic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of pro\n    ceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph\n    expressly addressed to that category. That would confuse the illus\n    trative nature of the subsection\u2019s list of categories with the contents\n    of the categories themselves. Reading the \u201cincluding but not limited\n    to\u201d clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as\n    well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction\n    principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)\u2019s structure and grammar and\n    in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs inde\n    terminate and virtually superfluous. See generally id., at 410. Sub\n    section (h)(1)\u2019s context supports this Court\u2019s conclusion. Subsection\n    (h)(7) provides that delay \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by\n    any judge\u201d may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends\n    of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of\n    the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,\u201d and records those\n    findings. In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection\n    (h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of ade\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  quate pretrial preparation time.               See \u00a7\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii),\n  3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). The Court\u2019s determination that the delay at issue\n  is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7),\n  and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only\n  where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion. The\n  Court\u2019s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1). See\n  Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502. Pp. 10\u201316.\n     (c) The Act does not force a district court to choose between reject\n  ing a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and\n  risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the\n  trial. A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection\n  (h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\n  findings. Subsection (h)(7) provides \u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d\n  Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts \u201cdiscretion . . . to ac\n  commodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The\n  Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the nec\n  essary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a de\n  fendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit. But dismissal\n  need not represent a windfall. If the court dismisses the charges\n  without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict. In\n  ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should\n  consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay. Pp. 16\u201318.\n     (d) This Court does not consider whether any of the Act\u2019s other ex\n  clusions would apply to all or part of the September 7 through Octo\n  ber 4 period that is not automatically excludable under subsection\n  (h)(1).

UNITED \n\n                  STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [March 8, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Speedy Trial Act or Act),\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73161 et seq., requires that a criminal defen\ndant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days after he is charged\nor makes an initial appearance, whichever is later, see\n\u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\nthat deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). The Act, however,\nexcludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain\nenumerated events. \u00a73161(h). As relevant here, \u201cdelay\nresulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d\nis automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calcu\nlation.1 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a73161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009) (hereinaf\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The excludability of delay \u201cresulting from . . . proceedings\u201d under\n\nsubsection (h)(1) is \u201cautomatic\u201d in the sense that a district court must\nexclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any\nfurther analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its\ncost. For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1),\nCongress already has determined that the benefit of such delay out\nweighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case.\nThe word \u201cautomatic\u201d serves as a useful shorthand. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Lucky, 569 F. 3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (\u201cSome exclusions are\nautomatic. Other exclusions require judicial action\u201d (citation omitted)).\n2                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nter subsection (h)(1)). In addition, \u201cdelay resulting from a\ncontinuance\u201d granted by the district court may be excluded\nif the district court makes the findings required by\n\u00a73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).\n   This case requires us to decide the narrow question\nwhether time granted to a party to prepare pretrial mo\ntions is automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day\nlimit under subsection (h)(1), or whether such time may be\nexcluded only if a court makes case-specific findings under\nsubsection (h)(7). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is auto\nmatically excludable under subsection (h)(1).2 534 F. 3d\n893, 898 (2008). We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009), and now reverse.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  On August 2, 2006, police officers surveilling an apart\nment building for drug activity saw petitioner and his\ngirlfriend enter a car parked in front of the building and\ndrive away. After observing petitioner commit several\ntraffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle. They\napproached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine\non petitioner\u2019s lap. After the officers read petitioner his\nMiranda warnings, petitioner made inculpatory state\nments. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\nPetitioner denied any association with the apartment\nbuilding where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend\nadmitted that she lived there and consented to a search of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 After the Eighth Circuit issued its decision below, Congress passed\n\nthe Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 4291, which made technical changes to the Speedy Trial Act,\nincluding the renumbering of several provisions. The amendments did\nnot change the substance of any provision relevant here. Accordingly,\nin this opinion, including our discussions of the orders and decisions\nunder review, we refer only to the current version of the Act.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher residence. The officers who conducted the search\nuncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, in\ncluding an identification card, cocaine, three firearms,\nammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested\npetitioner the next day.\n   On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being\na felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional pos\nsession with intent to distribute more than five grams of\ncocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1). The August\n24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day clock.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1). After petitioner\u2019s arraignment\non September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling\norder requiring, inter alia, that the parties file pretrial\nmotions by September 13.\n   On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to\nSeptember 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion\nand extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond\npetitioner\u2019s request, to September 25. On September 25,\nhowever, petitioner filed a \u201cWaiver of Pretrial Motions\u201d\nadvising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial\nmotions.\n   On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to\nconsider petitioner\u2019s \u201cwaiver,\u201d at which petitioner con\nfirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial\nmotions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found\nthat petitioner\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.\n   Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial was de\nlayed for several reasons. Though these delays are not\ndirectly relevant to the question presented here, we re\ncount them to explain the full context in which that ques\ntion arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue\nthe trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional\ntime to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the\nmotion and reset the trial for December 18.\n4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The parties then met informally and prepared a plea\nagreement, which they provided to the court. The District\nCourt scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20.\nAt the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement\nthe agreement and requested a new attorney. The District\nCourt rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted\npetitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw,\nand appointed new counsel.\n   On February 19, 2007\u2014179 days after petitioner was\nindicted\u2014petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment,\nclaiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion. In calculating how\nmany of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the\nDistrict Judge excluded the period from September 7\nthrough October 4 as \u201cwithin the extension of time\ngranted to file pretrial motions.\u201d3         Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.\n   In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on\nthe District Court\u2019s docket, which required the court to\nreschedule petitioner\u2019s trial. After obtaining the consent\nof the parties and finding that a continuance would serve\nthe public interest, the District Court continued peti\ntioner\u2019s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Peti\ntioner\u2019s 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found\npetitioner guilty on both counts and the District Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In addition, the District Judge excluded the continuance granted on\n\nNovember 9 (resetting the trial for December 18) under \u00a73161(h)(7)(A),\nand excluded the time from November 9 through December 20 as delay\nresulting from a plea agreement under \u00a73161(h)(1)(G). He further\nexcluded the time from December 20 through February 26 \u201cas it . . .\nresulted from [petitioner\u2019s] election not to implement a plea agreement,\nand his request to the court to have new counsel appointed for him.\u201d\nOrder in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 3. The judge stated\non the record that these continuances were necessary to ensure that\n\u201cthe ends of justice could more properly be served\u201d and \u201cobviously\noutweighed the best interest of the public and the defendant to a\nSpeedy Trial.\u201d Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlater sentenced him to concurrent 30-year terms of\nimprisonment.\n                             B\n   Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the\nEighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to\ndismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation. As relevant, the\nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the\ntime from September 7 (the original deadline for filing\npretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court\nheld a hearing on petitioner\u2019s decision to waive the right to\nfile pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day\nlimit. Although the District Court did not identify which\nprovision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of\nAppeals held that \u201cpretrial motion preparation time\u201d is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1)\u2014which\ncovers \u201cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning\nthe defendant\u201d\u2014as long as \u201cthe [district] court specifically\ngrants time for that purpose.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.4 In\nreaching this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit joined seven\nother Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1)\nthe same way.5 Two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In addition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s order\nexcluding the time from November 9 to, and including, December 18\nand from December 20 to, and including, February 23 as delays result\ning from continuances under \u00a73161(h)(7) and \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv), respec\ntively. The Court of Appeals did not address whether to exclude De\ncember 19. Nor did it decide whether to exclude the delay from\nFebruary 23 to March 5, because even if those days were included,\n\u201conly 58 days passed between [petitioner]\u2019s indictment and trial, fewer\nthan the 70 allowed by the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 900.\n   5 See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently,\nholding that time for preparing pretrial motions is outside\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s scope.6 We granted certiorari to resolve\nthis conflict.\n                              II\n   As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days of a defen\ndant\u2019s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from\nthe 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay.\nSection 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are ex\ncludable from the calculation.

It is.\n  The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner suffi\ncient time to file pretrial motions.8 Subsection (h)(1)(D)\n(hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically\nexcludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d\nRead, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201c(D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the\nmotion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion;\n\u201c(E) delay resulting from any proceeding relating to the transfer of a\ncase or the removal of any defendant from another district under the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n\u201c(F) delay resulting from transportation of any defendant from another\ndistrict, or to and from places of examination or hospitalization, except\nthat any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of\nremoval or an order directing such transportation, and the defendant\u2019s\narrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable;\n\u201c(G) delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea\nagreement to be entered into by the defendant and the attorney for the\nGovernment; and\n\u201c(H) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty\ndays, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually\nunder advisement by the court.\u201d\n   8 See Defendant\u2019s Request for Additional Time To File Pre-trial Mo\n\ntions in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (TCM) (ED Mo.), Doc. 19; Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44 (granting same).\n8                    BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntext governs the automatic excludability of delays \u201cresult\ning\u201d from a specific category of \u201cproceedings concerning\nthe defendant,\u201d namely, proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions.9 Because the delay at issue here results from a\ndecision granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not\nfrom a pretrial motion itself (the defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D). But\nthat does not make the delay at issue here automatically\nexcludable.\n  Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion\nrelated delay to automatic exclusion. Instead, it renders\nautomatically excludable only the delay that occurs \u201cfrom\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of\u201d the motion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    9 Thedissent argues that this conclusion lacks \u201cforce\u201d because \u201c[i]t is\nat least doubtful . . . that the delay at issue in the present case is delay\n\u2018resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\nAccording to the dissent, \u201cdelay \u2018resulting from\u2019 a pretrial motion is\ndelay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,\u201d which the \u201ctype of\ndelay involved in the present case\u201d does not.\u201d Post, at 4\u20135 (arguing that\nthe delay in this case instead \u201coccurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time\u201d).\n   The dissent\u2019s position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two\nisolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context.\nFor the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h)\nsupport our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic\nexcludability of delays \u201cresulting from\u201d proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions. As the dissent concedes, defining \u201cresulting from\u201d to mean \u201cas\na consequence of\u201d does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because\nthe dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cresulting from\u201d leaves ample room to con\nclude that the delay at issue here is \u201ca consequence of\u201d the category of\nproceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay\n\u201cas a consequence of\u201d a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or \u201cas a\nconsequence of\u201d a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for addi\ntional time). At bottom, the dissent\u2019s position is not that our interpre\ntation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent\u2019s interpretation is\npreferable. We disagree because the dissent\u2019s interpretation, among\nother things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsec\ntion (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(Emphasis added.) In so doing, the provision communi\ncates Congress\u2019 judgment that delay resulting from pre\ntrial motions is automatically excludable, i.e., excludable\nwithout district court findings, only from the time a mo\ntion is filed through the hearing or disposition point speci\nfied in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pre\ntrial motion-related delay are excludable only when\naccompanied by district court findings.10\n   This limitation is significant because Congress knew\nhow to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion\nbroadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinaf\nter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the auto\nmatic exclusion of \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding,\nincluding any examinations, to determine the mental\ncompetency or physical capacity of the defendant.\u201d (Em\nphasis added.) With the word \u201cincluding,\u201d Congress indi\ncated that other competency-related proceedings besides\n\u201cexaminations\u201d might fall within subparagraph (A)\u2019s\nautomatic exclusion. In subparagraph (D), by contrast,\nCongress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term\nsuch as \u201cincluding,\u201d and provided instead that only pre\ntrial motion-related delay \u201cfrom the filing\u201d of a motion to\nthe hearing or disposition point specified in the provision\nis automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit.\n   Thus, although the period of delay the Government\nseeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)\u2019s text, but\n\nalso from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the\n70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d In this case, the comma after the first\nphrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of exclud\nable delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)\u2019s automatic\nexclusion for delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion is limited to delay\nthat occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identi\nfied in the provision.\n10                  BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngoverned by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the\nfirst day upon which Congress specified that such delay\nmay be automatically excluded. The result is that the\npretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is\nnot automatically excludable.11\n                             B\n  The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into auto\nmatic excludability because \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here,\nsubparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s] of more general appli\ncation\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991). In arguing\nthat this principle applies, but requires a result different\nfrom the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government\nand several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in\na manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.\n                              1\n  There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more\nspecific than the \u201cgeneral\u201d language in subsection (h)(1),\npost, at 2, 6, or that \u201c[g]eneral language of a statutory\nprovision, although broad enough to include it, will not be\nheld to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another\npart of the same enactment,\u201d D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v.\nPopkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). We part company with\nthe dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D)\ngoverns the period of delay at issue in this case. The\ndissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground\nthat it is foreclosed by the statute. See post, at 5 (assert\ning that the delay at issue in this case is \u201cnot necessarily\u201d\ncovered by subparagraph (D)). Instead, it joins the Gov\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he\n\nrequests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis. Even if he files\nsuch a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period\nof automatically excludable delay pre-filing preparation time that\nsubparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

This argument takes aim at an exagger\nated target. Because we conclude that the type of delay at\nissue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can\nin future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries,\na result that is not certain even in this case. See infra, at\n17\u201318. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on\nremand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify read\ning subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to\n\u201cother proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d) to permit\nautomatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any\ndecision to continue a deadline.\n   The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because\nthe provision\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto\u201d shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclu\nsion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated\nsubparagraphs. See post, at 3; see also United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument\nconfuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s list of\ncategories of excludable delay (each of which is repre\nsented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the catego\nries themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative\nrather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclu\nsion that a delay that falls within the category of delay\naddressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits\nin that subparagraph. The \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d\nclause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to\nmodify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list\nitself. As noted, such a reading would violate settled\nprinciples of statutory construction because it would ig\n12                   BLOATE v.

See Gozlon-\nPeretz, supra, at 410; Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167,\n174 (2001) (\u201c[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence,\nor word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)). Our reading avoids these\nproblems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing\neach of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, con\nclusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates other\nwise, see, e.g., \u00a73161(h)(1)(A); supra, at 9, the automatic\nexcludability of the delay resulting from the category of\nproceedings it addresses.\n   The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)\u2019s\nlimits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we\nshould automatically exclude the delay at issue here under\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s opening clause, see post, at 2, because it\nis not \u201cclear\u201d that the delay is governed by the more spe\ncific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D). Post,\nat 5. We decline this invitation to use the alleged uncer\ntainty in subparagraph (D)\u2019s scope as a justification for\ndisregarding its limits and instead expanding, through\nliberal interpretation of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s generic opening\nclause,12 what the dissent itself describes as the automatic\nexclusion \u201cexceptio[n]\u201d to the Act\u2019s 70-day period and the\nAct\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d requiring \u201cends-of-justice findings for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The dissent argues that the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d in this case is the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s disposition of petitioner\u2019s motion for additional time to\nfile pretrial motions. See post, at 2. If that were correct, any order\ndisposing of a motion\u2014including a pretrial motion under subparagraph\n(D)\u2014would be a separate \u201cproceeding,\u201d and any resulting delay would\nbe automatically excludable. The dissent\u2019s reading renders superflu\nous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the\nexclusion of time necessary for \u201cadequate preparation for pretrial\nproceedings,\u201d      \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii),  and    \u201ceffective    preparation,\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

The problem with this\nreading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection\n(h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the\ndefinition of a \u201cproceeding concerning the defendant,\u201d and\nthus threatens the Act\u2019s manifest purpose of ensuring\nspeedy trials by construing the Act\u2019s automatic exclusion\nexceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day\nrule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled,\nby the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon\nwhich the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the pros\npect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in\nthis case. Hence our conclusion that the text and struc\nture of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion\nof the delay at issue in this case.\n                               2\n   Our conclusion is further supported by subsection\n(h)(1)\u2019s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).\nSubsection (h)(7) provides that delays \u201cresulting from a\ncontinuance granted by any judge\u201d may be excluded, but\nonly if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends of justice served by\ntaking such action outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial\u201d and records those\nfindings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify\na continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice\nrecognized the importance of adequate pretrial prepara\ntion time. See \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court\nto consider whether the \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d nature of a\ncase makes it \u201cunreasonable to expect adequate prepara\ntion for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within\nthe time limits\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv)\n14                   BLOATE v.

Our determination that the\ndelay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives\nfull effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions\nfor excluding certain types of delay only where district\ncourt makes findings justifying the exclusion.13 Cf. post,\nat 11\u201312 (construing subsection (h)(1) in a manner that\ncould encompass, and govern, delays expressly within\nsubsection (h)(7)\u2019s purview).\n                              3\n  Finally, our Speedy Trial Act precedents support our\nreading of subsection (h)(1). We recently explained that\nthe Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to\nvindicate the public interest in the swift administration of\njustice. We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of\nthe Act even if he believes it would be in his interest;\n\u201c[a]llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine\nthe Act because there are many cases . . . in which the\nprosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy\nto opt out of the Act, to the detriment of the public inter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Had Congress wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\n\ntime automatically, it could have said so. As noted, subsection (h)(7)\ntwice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances\nthat a court may grant in the interests of justice.                   See\n\u00a7\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv). Congress easily could have referred to\npreparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1). See, e.g., Speedy Trial\nAct Amendments Act of 1979, H. R. 3630, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75(c)\n(1979) (proposing to exclude under subparagraph (D) all \u201cdelay result\ning from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses\nand from hearings thereon\u201d (emphasis added)).

Yet these same courts have recognized that\nreading subsection (h)(1) to exclude all time for preparing\npretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a\nspeedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have\nrecognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or\nboth parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.\nSee Zedner, supra, at 502.

Such careful parsing would seem\nunnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not\nconclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the\ncategory of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay\nmay simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).\n16               BLOATE v.

As noted, subsection (h)(7)\nexpressly accounts for the possibility that a district court\nwould need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate\npreparation time. An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is\nnot automatic, however, and requires specific findings.\nAllowing district courts to exclude automatically such\ndelays would redesign this statutory framework.\n                             C\n   We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that\nhave interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically\npretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a\ncontrary reading of that provision would lay \u201ca trap for\ntrial judges\u201d by forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act\nviolation if they wish to grant a defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time to prepare a pretrial motion, United States\nv.

Fortunately, we can abide by the\nlimitations Congress imposed on the statutory rights at\nissue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that\nwould trap trial courts.\n   For the reasons we explained above, neither subpara\ngraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes\ntime granted to prepare pretrial motions. This conclusion\ndoes not lay a \u201ctrap for trial judges\u201d because it limits (in a\nway the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In\nconsidering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of\ntime will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to\ndevote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay\nare justified, given both the statutory and constitutional\nrequirement of speedy trials. Placing these reasons in the\nrecord does not add an appreciable burden on these\njudges. Neither are district courts forced to choose be\ntween rejecting a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare\npretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if\npreparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court\nmay exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it\ngrants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\nfindings \u201cthat the ends of justice served by taking such\naction outweigh the best interest of the public and the\ndefendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Subsection (h)(7) provides\n\u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498,\nand gives district courts \u201cdiscretion\u2014within limits and\nsubject to specific procedures\u2014to accommodate limited\ndelays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The statutory\nscheme thus ensures that district courts may grant neces\nsary pretrial motion preparation time without risking\ndismissal.\n   Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a\ndistrict court may fail to make the findings necessary for\nan exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall\ngain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act\u2019s\n18               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a\nwindfall. A district court may dismiss the charges without\nprejudice, thus allowing the Government to refile charges\nor reindict the defendant. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73162(a)(1). In\nruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district\ncourt should consider, among other factors, the party\nresponsible for the delay. See ibid. (\u201cIn determining\nwhether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the\n[district] court shall consider, among others, each of the\nfollowing factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts\nand circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;\nand the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of\nthis chapter and on the administration of justice\u201d (empha\nsis added)); see also United States v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326,\n343 (1988) (\u201cSeemingly ignored were the brevity of the\ndelay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respon\ndent, as well as respondent\u2019s own illicit contribution to the\ndelay\u201d).\n                             III\n   Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period\nfrom September 7 through October 4, which includes the\nadditional time granted by the District Court for pretrial\nmotion preparation, is not automatically excludable under\nsubsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address\nwhether any portion of that time might have been other\nwise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its\nmerits brief that another provision of the Act could sup\nport exclusion, presenting the argument that September\n25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in\nits brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argu\nment. We therefore do not consider whether any other\nexclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period.\nInstead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion on the understanding that nothing in the opinion\nbars the Eighth Circuit from considering, on remand, the\nGovernment\u2019s argument that the indictment, and convic\ntions under it, remain effective.\n   Bloate moved, on September 7, 2006, to extend the\ndeadline for filing pretrial motions. The Magistrate Judge\ngranted Bloate\u2019s request that same day, extending the\ndeadline from September 13 to September 25. Having\ngained more time, Bloate decided that pretrial motions\nwere unnecessary after all. Accordingly, on September 25,\nhe filed a proposed waiver of his right to file such motions.\nOn October 4, the Magistrate Judge accepted the waiver\nfollowing a hearing at which the judge found the waiver\nknowing and voluntary. As urged by the Government,\neven if the clock continued to run from September 7,\n    \u201cit stopped on September 25, when [Bloate] filed a\n    pleading advising the court that he had decided not to\n    raise any issues by pretrial motion. . . .

See 18\nU. S. C. A. \u00a73161 (2000 ed. and Supp. 2009). The provi\nsion at issue here, \u00a73161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009), automatically\nexcludes \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other pro\nceedings concerning the defendant, including but not\nlimited to\u201d eight specific types of delay that are set out in\nsubparagraphs (A)\u2013(H).

Subpara\ngraph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that\nare specifically identified as \u201cdelay resulting from [a]\nproceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\u201d but as noted, this\nlist is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto.\u201d \u201cWhen \u2018include\u2019 is utilized, it is generally improper to\nconclude that entities not specifically enumerated are\nexcluded.\u201d 2A N.

S. 95, 100 (1941); Black\u2019s\nLaw 831 (\u201cThe participle including typically indicates a\npartial list\u201d). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the\nadditional phrase \u201cnot limited to\u201d reinforces this point.\nSee United States v. Tibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7\n1985).\n   Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase \u201cincluding\nbut not limited to,\u201d the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to\nshow that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the\ngeneral rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court\u2019s\nargument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just \u201cdelay\nresulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D), but\nalso delay resulting from \u201cproceedings involving pretrial\nmotions,\u201d ante, at 8, and n. 9 (emphasis added), and \u201call\npretrial motion-related delay,\u201d ante, at 8 (emphasis added).\nIn the Court\u2019s view, Congress has expressed a judgment\nthat if a period of \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d does not\nfall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it\nis \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district court\n4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfindings.\u201d Ante, at 9. Thus, since subparagraph (D) does\nnot provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the\ngranting of a defense request for more time to prepare\npretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not\nexcluded from the 70-day calculation. The Court\u2019s analy\nsis, however, is not supported by either the text of sub\nparagraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its\nenactment.\n                              D\n   The Court\u2019s argument would have some force if it were\nclear that the delay involved in the present case is \u201cdelay\nresulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). It\ncould then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a\nlegislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion\nof delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay\noccurs during the period \u201cfrom the filing of the motion\nthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d Ibid.2\n   It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue\nin the present case is delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\nmotion.\u201d Ibid.3 The phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d means \u201cpro\nceed[ing], spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect,\nor conclusion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\ntionary 1937 (1971). Thus, delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pre\ntrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 TheCourt hints that the defense\u2019s request for additional time might\nitself be a pretrial motion within the meaning of \u00a73161(h)(1)(D).\nNeither party relies on this theory. The Court of Appeals found that\n\u201cBloate never filed a pretrial motion.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.\n   3 This much is clear from the Court\u2019s own language. The Court writes\n\nthat \u201calthough the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in\nthis case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that\nperiod precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such\ndelay may be automatically excluded.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310 (emphasis added).\nSubparagraph (D) does not speak of delay that results from a \u201cproceed\ning,\u201d ibid.; subsection (h)(1), however, does.

The type of delay involved in the present case,\nhowever, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial\nmotion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time.\nThe particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this\npoint because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.4\n   It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase\n\u201cresulting from\u201d and substitutes a broader phrase of its\nown invention. The Court writes that \u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d that is not captured by subparagraph (D)\u2019s\ntext is \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district\ncourt findings.\u201d Ante, at 9. See also ante, at 8 (\u201cSubpara\ngraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay\nto automatic exclusion\u201d); ante, at 9 (\u201c[O]nly pretrial mo\ntion-related delay \u2018from the filing\u2019 of a motion to the hear\ning or disposition point specified in the provision is auto\nmatically excludable\u201d); ante, at 15, n. 14 (\u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d); ibid. (\u201cpretrial motion-related proceed\nings\u201d). But \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d is not necessar\nily delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion.\n   Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase \u201cre\nsulting from\u201d to mean \u201crelated [to],\u201d see ante, at 9, there\nare at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.\nFirst, because subparagraphs (A)\u2013(H) are meant to be\nillustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as\nlimiting unless the limitation is very clear. Second, the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of subparagraph (D) leads to an\nanomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have in\ntended. Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes\n\u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of, such motion,\u201d it is clear that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 But even if petitioner had filed pretrial motions, the delay resulting\n\nfrom the granting of the extension still would not be delay \u201cresulting\nfrom\u201d the motion.\n6               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsubparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting\nfrom the granting of a prosecution request for additional\ntime to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial motions. The\nCourt has not identified any reason why Congress might\nhave wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay\nresulting from the granting of a prosecution request for\nadditional time to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial mo\ntions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the\ndefendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare those\nvery motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Con\ngress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the\nCourt\u2019s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should\nbe rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply\nonly to delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial motion,\u201d and\nbecause the delay involved here does not result from a\npretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that sub\nparagraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the\nscope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).\n                             E\n  The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the\ncurrent version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the\nsame conclusion. That language was adopted to expand\nthe reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the\nrelevant provision of the Act excluded only \u201cdelay result\ning from hearings on pretrial motions,\u201d 88 Stat. 2078, and\ncourts had interpreted this language literally to exclude\nonly time actually devoted to hearings. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Lewis, 425 F. Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977);\nUnited States v. Conroy, No. 77 Cr. 607 (CHT), 1978 U. S.\nDist.

S. Rep. No. 96\u2013\n212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S. Rep.). See also id., at 26.\nCongress\u2019 expansion of the exclusion set out in subpara\ngraph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by\nhearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from\npretrial motions does not support the inference that Con\ngress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to\ncount against the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day period.\n   Contending that Congress could have been more explicit\nif it \u201cwished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\ntime automatically,\u201d the Court cites as an example a\nlegislative proposal by the Department of Justice to pro\nvide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pre\ntrial motions. Ante, at 14, n. 13. The Court is correct that\nCongress did not choose this option, but the Court\u2019s argu\nment misses the point.\n   First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Depart\nment\u2019s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a\nsuccessful defense request for additional time to prepare\npretrial motions. That is the delay in dispute here. In\nstead, the Justice Department\u2019s proposal excluded all\n\u201cdelay resulting from the preparation and service of pre\ntrial motions and responses from hearings thereon.\u201d S.\n961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75 (1979) (as introduced).\n   Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Com\nmittee report for rejecting the Justice Department pro\nposal do not apply when the delay results from the grant\ning of a defense request such as the one at issue here. The\nSenate Committee report noted that, when excluding time\nfor the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be \u201cquite\ndifficult to determine a point at which preparation actu\nally begins.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. But when a district court\ngrants a defendant\u2019s motion for time to prepare pretrial\n8                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmotions, that concern is not present. See United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the impor\ntance of the District Court\u2019s expressly stopping the speedy\ntrial clock to create a point from which to measure prepa\nration time).5 In addition, the Committee expressed the\nview that \u201cin routine cases, preparation time should not be\nexcluded.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. However, cases in which a\ndistrict court accedes to a defense request for more than\nthe usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial\nmotions are by definition not routine.\n   Third, there is no reason why Congress should have\nsupposed that the language that Congress and the Presi\ndent enacted did not reach delay resulting from the grant\ning of the defendant\u2019s request for additional time to pre\npare pretrial motions. As explained above, supra, at 2, 4\u2013\n6, such delay results from a proceeding concerning\nthe defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial\nmotion.\n   In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a de\nfense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial mo\ntions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection\n(h)(1), that automatically excludes delay \u201cresulting from\n[a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant;\u201d (2) the sub\nparagraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase\n\u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d are illustrative, not exhaus\ntive; and (3) neither the text of subparagraph (D) nor the\ncircumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The Court incorrectly states that the Courts of Appeals that have\n\nread subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time for pretrial motions\nhave found it necessary to \u201cimpos[e] extratextual limitations on exclud\nability,\u201d namely, that the trial judge must expressly grant an extension\nof the time for the completion of pretrial motions. See ante, at 16. This\nrequirement, however, springs from the language of subsection (h)(1),\nfor it is the granting of the extension request that constitutes the\n\u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d that triggers the exclusion\nunder subsection (h)(1).

For these reasons, I would hold that the\ndelay in question here is automatically excluded.\n                              II\n  The Court advances several additional arguments in\nsupport of its analysis, but none is persuasive.\n                               A\n  Two of these arguments hinge on the Court\u2019s unjustifia\nbly broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), i.e., that it\ncovers all \u201cpretrial motion-related delay.\u201d First, the Court\nreasons that under a contrary interpretation, \u201ca court\ncould extend by weeks or months, without any finding that\nthe incursion on the Act\u2019s timeliness guarantee is justified,\nthe entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the\nAct sets a default limit of 70 days.\u201d Ante, at 13. But the\nsame is true of the Court\u2019s interpretation. Even under an\ninterpretation that automatically excludes delay \u201conly\nfrom the time a motion is filed through the hearing or\ndisposition point,\u201d ante, at 9, there appears to be no reason\nwhy a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the\nautomatically excludable period of time under subpara\ngraph (D) through any number of means, including: (1)\nextending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see\nUnited States v. Latham, No. 82\u2013CR\u2013890, 1983 U. S. Dist.\nLEXIS 14219, *1\u2013*3 (ND Ill., Aug. 30, 1983); (3) allowing\npre-hearing supplemental briefing, see United States v.\nFaison, No. 06\u20134332, 2007 U. S. App. LEXIS 23298, *6\u2013*9\n(CA4, Oct. 4, 2007); (4) deferring the hearing on a pretrial\nmotion, see United States v. Riley, 991 F. 2d 120, 124 (CA4\n1993); (5) conducting multiple hearings on the motion or\nmotions, e.g., United States v. Boone, Crim. No. 00\u20133, 2002\nWL 31761364, *20, n. 12 (D NJ, Dec. 6, 2002); or (6) allow\ning the filing of post hearing submissions, see Henderson\n10                  BLOATE v.

Indeed, in\nHenderson we held that 295 days of delay resulting from\nthe filing of a pretrial motion were automatically exclud\nable, and we noted that \u201cCongress was aware of the\nbreadth of the exclusion it was enacting.\u201d Id., at 327.6\nThe Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary\nto protect the Act\u2019s \u201ctimeliness guarantee,\u201d ante, at 13, is\nillusory.\n   For a similar reason, the Court\u2019s interpretation is not\nsupported by the rule of construction that \u201c \u2018[a] specific\nprovision\u2019 . . . \u2018controls one[s] of more general application.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 10. This rule applies only when specific and\ngeneral statutory provisions conflict. National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534\nU. S. 327, 335\u2013336 (2002). Here, there is no conflict be\ncause, even if subparagraph (D) governs \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom any pretrial motion,\u201d there is no basis for concluding\nthat subparagraph (D) governs all \u201cpretrial motion-related\ndelay.\u201d\n                              B\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s claim, its decision is not sup\nported by \u00a73161(h)(7)(A), which excludes \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom a continuance\u201d provided that the trial court \u201csets\nforth, in the record of the case, . . . its reasons for finding\nthat the ends of justice served by the granting of such\ncontinuance outweigh the best interests of the public and\nthe defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d One might argue that a\ntrial judge grants a \u201ccontinuance\u201d whenever the judge\npostpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 That the delay in Henderson was delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\n\nmotion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D); see 476 U. S., at 322, 330\u2013331, distinguishes\nthat case from the scenario here, where no pretrial motion has been\nfiled and the delay in question \u201cresults from a proceeding\u201d that, in the\nCourt\u2019s view, is \u201cgoverned by subparagraph (D).\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310.

See \u00a73161(h)(7)(A) (\u201c[a]ny\nperiod of delay resulting from a continuance\u201d). But such a\nreading would render subsection (h)(1) and subparagraphs\n(A)\u2013(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances\nrequired ends-of-justice findings. The plain terms of\nsubsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that\nCongress intended for some periods of delay that postpone\nthe trial date to be automatically excludable.\n   Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its\nsubparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for con\ntinuances. See, e.g., United States v. Aviles-Alvarez, 868\nF. 2d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial\nmotion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court\n\u201cdoes not have to make findings or consider any factors\u201d).\nA period of delay resulting from a continuance requires\nends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall\nwithin the subset of automatically excludable delay de\nfined by subsection (h)(1). When a period of delay result\ning from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclu\nsion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more\nspecific provisions of subsection (h)(1). See Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (\u201cA specific\nprovision controls over one of more general application\u201d).\nCf. ante, at 10.\n   For the reasons discussed, see supra, at 2, the granting\nof a defense request for an extension of time to complete\npretrial motions is a \u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defen\ndant\u201d within the meaning of subsection (h)(1). It may also\nqualify as a \u201ccontinuance\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back\nthe trial date. But a court should resolve the conflict by\napplying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1).\nThis result is faithful not only to the plain language of the\n12               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nstatute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of\nexceptions to the general rule that continuances require\nends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when\ndefense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions\ncannot be completed within the time allotted and is\ngranted an extension, it will generally go without saying\nthat the judge has considered whether the ends of justice\nwill be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to\nrecite this determination on the record will often be an\nempty exercise.\n                              III\n   The Court does not believe that its interpretation will\nhave serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by\nmaking the on-the-record findings required under\n\u00a73161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the grant\ning of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial\nmotions. As this case illustrates, however, there will be\ncases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges\nwill fail to make those findings, and indictments will be\ndismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the\nrecord were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have\nprovided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category\nof delay encompassed by \u00a73161(h)(1).\n   The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation\noccurs because of delay caused by an extension requested\nby the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment\nwithout prejudice. But as we have recognized, even when\na new indictment may be obtained, \u201csubstantial delay may\nwell make reprosecution . . . unlikely.\u201d United States v.\nTaylor, 487 U. S. 326, 342 (1988).

Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 8, 2010\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendant\u2019s trial\n  to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance,\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\n  that deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). As relevant here, the Act\n  automatically excludes from the 70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from\n  . . . proceedings concerning the defendant,\u201d 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a73161(h)(1)\n  (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court\n  to exclude \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance\u201d it grants, provided\n  the court makes findings required by \u00a73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsec\n  tion (h)(7)). Petitioner\u2019s indictment on federal firearm and drug pos\n  session charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006. After\n  petitioner\u2019s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to\n  file pretrial motions by September 13. On September 7, the court\n  granted petitioner\u2019s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new\n  due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial\n  motions. On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver vol\n  untary and intelligent. Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial\n  was delayed several times, often at petitioner\u2019s instigation. On Feb\n  ruary 19, 2007\u2014179 days after he was indicted\u2014he moved to dismiss\n  the indictment, claiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. In\n  denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from Sep\n  tember 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time. At\n  trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to\n  concurrent prison terms. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of\n  the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7\n  through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day\n  limit under subsection (h)(1).\nHeld: The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically\n2                      BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1). Such time\n    may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance\n    based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7). Pp. 6\u201318.\n       (a) The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinaf\n    ter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders auto\n    matically excludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\n    the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\n    other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d This provision communi\n    cates Congress\u2019 judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is auto\n    matically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed\n    through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pre\n    trial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continu\n    ance under subsection (h)(7). This limitation is significant because\n    Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s\n    enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired. Although the pe\n    riod of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results\n    from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period pre\n    cedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay\n    may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically exclud\n    able. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry be\n    cause \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here, subparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s]\n    of more general application\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).\n    Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. A contrary result\n    would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the pro\n    priety of this Court\u2019s approach. Subsection (h)(1)\u2019s phrase \u201cincluding\n    but not limited to\u201d does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits auto\n    matic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of pro\n    ceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph\n    expressly addressed to that category. That would confuse the illus\n    trative nature of the subsection\u2019s list of categories with the contents\n    of the categories themselves. Reading the \u201cincluding but not limited\n    to\u201d clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as\n    well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction\n    principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)\u2019s structure and grammar and\n    in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs inde\n    terminate and virtually superfluous. See generally id., at 410. Sub\n    section (h)(1)\u2019s context supports this Court\u2019s conclusion. Subsection\n    (h)(7) provides that delay \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by\n    any judge\u201d may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends\n    of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of\n    the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,\u201d and records those\n    findings. In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection\n    (h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of ade\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The Court\u2019s determination that the delay at issue\n  is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7),\n  and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only\n  where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion. The\n  Court\u2019s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1). See\n  Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502. Pp. 10\u201316.\n     (c) The Act does not force a district court to choose between reject\n  ing a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and\n  risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the\n  trial. A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection\n  (h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\n  findings. Subsection (h)(7) provides \u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d\n  Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts \u201cdiscretion . . . to ac\n  commodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The\n  Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the nec\n  essary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a de\n  fendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit. But dismissal\n  need not represent a windfall. If the court dismisses the charges\n  without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict. In\n  ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should\n  consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay.

S. C. \u00a73161 et seq., requires that a criminal defen\ndant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days after he is charged\nor makes an initial appearance, whichever is later, see\n\u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\nthat deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). The Act, however,\nexcludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain\nenumerated events. \u00a73161(h). As relevant here, \u201cdelay\nresulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d\nis automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calcu\nlation.1 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a73161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009) (hereinaf\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The excludability of delay \u201cresulting from . . . proceedings\u201d under\n\nsubsection (h)(1) is \u201cautomatic\u201d in the sense that a district court must\nexclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any\nfurther analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its\ncost. For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1),\nCongress already has determined that the benefit of such delay out\nweighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case.\nThe word \u201cautomatic\u201d serves as a useful shorthand. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Lucky, 569 F. 3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (\u201cSome exclusions are\nautomatic. Other exclusions require judicial action\u201d (citation omitted)).\n2                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nter subsection (h)(1)). In addition, \u201cdelay resulting from a\ncontinuance\u201d granted by the district court may be excluded\nif the district court makes the findings required by\n\u00a73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).\n   This case requires us to decide the narrow question\nwhether time granted to a party to prepare pretrial mo\ntions is automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day\nlimit under subsection (h)(1), or whether such time may be\nexcluded only if a court makes case-specific findings under\nsubsection (h)(7). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is auto\nmatically excludable under subsection (h)(1).2 534 F. 3d\n893, 898 (2008). We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009), and now reverse.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  On August 2, 2006, police officers surveilling an apart\nment building for drug activity saw petitioner and his\ngirlfriend enter a car parked in front of the building and\ndrive away. After observing petitioner commit several\ntraffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle. They\napproached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine\non petitioner\u2019s lap. After the officers read petitioner his\nMiranda warnings, petitioner made inculpatory state\nments. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\nPetitioner denied any association with the apartment\nbuilding where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend\nadmitted that she lived there and consented to a search of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 After the Eighth Circuit issued its decision below, Congress passed\n\nthe Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 4291, which made technical changes to the Speedy Trial Act,\nincluding the renumbering of several provisions. The amendments did\nnot change the substance of any provision relevant here. Accordingly,\nin this opinion, including our discussions of the orders and decisions\nunder review, we refer only to the current version of the Act.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher residence. The officers who conducted the search\nuncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, in\ncluding an identification card, cocaine, three firearms,\nammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested\npetitioner the next day.\n   On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being\na felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional pos\nsession with intent to distribute more than five grams of\ncocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1). The August\n24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day clock.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1). After petitioner\u2019s arraignment\non September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling\norder requiring, inter alia, that the parties file pretrial\nmotions by September 13.\n   On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to\nSeptember 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion\nand extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond\npetitioner\u2019s request, to September 25. On September 25,\nhowever, petitioner filed a \u201cWaiver of Pretrial Motions\u201d\nadvising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial\nmotions.\n   On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to\nconsider petitioner\u2019s \u201cwaiver,\u201d at which petitioner con\nfirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial\nmotions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found\nthat petitioner\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.\n   Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial was de\nlayed for several reasons. Though these delays are not\ndirectly relevant to the question presented here, we re\ncount them to explain the full context in which that ques\ntion arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue\nthe trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional\ntime to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the\nmotion and reset the trial for December 18.\n4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The parties then met informally and prepared a plea\nagreement, which they provided to the court. The District\nCourt scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20.\nAt the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement\nthe agreement and requested a new attorney. The District\nCourt rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted\npetitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw,\nand appointed new counsel.\n   On February 19, 2007\u2014179 days after petitioner was\nindicted\u2014petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment,\nclaiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion. In calculating how\nmany of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the\nDistrict Judge excluded the period from September 7\nthrough October 4 as \u201cwithin the extension of time\ngranted to file pretrial motions.\u201d3         Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.\n   In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on\nthe District Court\u2019s docket, which required the court to\nreschedule petitioner\u2019s trial. After obtaining the consent\nof the parties and finding that a continuance would serve\nthe public interest, the District Court continued peti\ntioner\u2019s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Peti\ntioner\u2019s 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found\npetitioner guilty on both counts and the District Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In addition, the District Judge excluded the continuance granted on\n\nNovember 9 (resetting the trial for December 18) under \u00a73161(h)(7)(A),\nand excluded the time from November 9 through December 20 as delay\nresulting from a plea agreement under \u00a73161(h)(1)(G). He further\nexcluded the time from December 20 through February 26 \u201cas it . . .\nresulted from [petitioner\u2019s] election not to implement a plea agreement,\nand his request to the court to have new counsel appointed for him.\u201d\nOrder in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 3. The judge stated\non the record that these continuances were necessary to ensure that\n\u201cthe ends of justice could more properly be served\u201d and \u201cobviously\noutweighed the best interest of the public and the defendant to a\nSpeedy Trial.\u201d Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlater sentenced him to concurrent 30-year terms of\nimprisonment.\n                             B\n   Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the\nEighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to\ndismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation. As relevant, the\nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the\ntime from September 7 (the original deadline for filing\npretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court\nheld a hearing on petitioner\u2019s decision to waive the right to\nfile pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day\nlimit. Although the District Court did not identify which\nprovision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of\nAppeals held that \u201cpretrial motion preparation time\u201d is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1)\u2014which\ncovers \u201cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning\nthe defendant\u201d\u2014as long as \u201cthe [district] court specifically\ngrants time for that purpose.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.4 In\nreaching this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit joined seven\nother Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1)\nthe same way.5 Two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In addition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s order\nexcluding the time from November 9 to, and including, December 18\nand from December 20 to, and including, February 23 as delays result\ning from continuances under \u00a73161(h)(7) and \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv), respec\ntively. The Court of Appeals did not address whether to exclude De\ncember 19. Nor did it decide whether to exclude the delay from\nFebruary 23 to March 5, because even if those days were included,\n\u201conly 58 days passed between [petitioner]\u2019s indictment and trial, fewer\nthan the 70 allowed by the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 900.\n   5 See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently,\nholding that time for preparing pretrial motions is outside\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s scope.6 We granted certiorari to resolve\nthis conflict.\n                              II\n   As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days of a defen\ndant\u2019s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from\nthe 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay.\nSection 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are ex\ncludable from the calculation. Some of these delays are\nexcludable only if the district court makes certain findings\nenumerated in the statute. See \u00a73161(h)(7). Other delays\nare automatically excludable, i.e., they may be excluded\nwithout district court findings. As relevant here, subsec\ntion (h)(1) requires the automatic exclusion of \u201c[a]ny pe\nriod of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning\nthe defendant, including but not limited to\u201d periods of\ndelay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of\nproceedings.7 The Government contends that the time the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nTibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985); United States v.

We disagree, and conclude that such time may be\nexcluded only when a district court enters appropriate\nfindings under subsection (h)(7).\n                             A\n  The eight subparagraphs in subsection (h)(1) address\nthe automatic excludability of delay generated for certain\nenumerated purposes. Thus, we first consider whether\nthe delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these\nsubparagraphs. It is.\n  The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner suffi\ncient time to file pretrial motions.8 Subsection (h)(1)(D)\n(hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically\nexcludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d\nRead, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201c(D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the\nmotion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion;\n\u201c(E) delay resulting from any proceeding relating to the transfer of a\ncase or the removal of any defendant from another district under the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n\u201c(F) delay resulting from transportation of any defendant from another\ndistrict, or to and from places of examination or hospitalization, except\nthat any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of\nremoval or an order directing such transportation, and the defendant\u2019s\narrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable;\n\u201c(G) delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea\nagreement to be entered into by the defendant and the attorney for the\nGovernment; and\n\u201c(H) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty\ndays, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually\nunder advisement by the court.\u201d\n   8 See Defendant\u2019s Request for Additional Time To File Pre-trial Mo\n\ntions in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (TCM) (ED Mo.), Doc. 19; Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44 (granting same).\n8                    BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntext governs the automatic excludability of delays \u201cresult\ning\u201d from a specific category of \u201cproceedings concerning\nthe defendant,\u201d namely, proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions.9 Because the delay at issue here results from a\ndecision granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not\nfrom a pretrial motion itself (the defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D). But\nthat does not make the delay at issue here automatically\nexcludable.\n  Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion\nrelated delay to automatic exclusion. Instead, it renders\nautomatically excludable only the delay that occurs \u201cfrom\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of\u201d the motion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    9 Thedissent argues that this conclusion lacks \u201cforce\u201d because \u201c[i]t is\nat least doubtful . . . that the delay at issue in the present case is delay\n\u2018resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\nAccording to the dissent, \u201cdelay \u2018resulting from\u2019 a pretrial motion is\ndelay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,\u201d which the \u201ctype of\ndelay involved in the present case\u201d does not.\u201d Post, at 4\u20135 (arguing that\nthe delay in this case instead \u201coccurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time\u201d).\n   The dissent\u2019s position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two\nisolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context.\nFor the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h)\nsupport our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic\nexcludability of delays \u201cresulting from\u201d proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions. As the dissent concedes, defining \u201cresulting from\u201d to mean \u201cas\na consequence of\u201d does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because\nthe dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cresulting from\u201d leaves ample room to con\nclude that the delay at issue here is \u201ca consequence of\u201d the category of\nproceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay\n\u201cas a consequence of\u201d a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or \u201cas a\nconsequence of\u201d a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for addi\ntional time). At bottom, the dissent\u2019s position is not that our interpre\ntation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent\u2019s interpretation is\npreferable. We disagree because the dissent\u2019s interpretation, among\nother things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsec\ntion (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(Emphasis added.) In so doing, the provision communi\ncates Congress\u2019 judgment that delay resulting from pre\ntrial motions is automatically excludable, i.e., excludable\nwithout district court findings, only from the time a mo\ntion is filed through the hearing or disposition point speci\nfied in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pre\ntrial motion-related delay are excludable only when\naccompanied by district court findings.10\n   This limitation is significant because Congress knew\nhow to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion\nbroadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinaf\nter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the auto\nmatic exclusion of \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding,\nincluding any examinations, to determine the mental\ncompetency or physical capacity of the defendant.\u201d (Em\nphasis added.) With the word \u201cincluding,\u201d Congress indi\ncated that other competency-related proceedings besides\n\u201cexaminations\u201d might fall within subparagraph (A)\u2019s\nautomatic exclusion. In subparagraph (D), by contrast,\nCongress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term\nsuch as \u201cincluding,\u201d and provided instead that only pre\ntrial motion-related delay \u201cfrom the filing\u201d of a motion to\nthe hearing or disposition point specified in the provision\nis automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit.\n   Thus, although the period of delay the Government\nseeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)\u2019s text, but\n\nalso from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the\n70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d In this case, the comma after the first\nphrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of exclud\nable delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)\u2019s automatic\nexclusion for delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion is limited to delay\nthat occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identi\nfied in the provision.\n10                  BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngoverned by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the\nfirst day upon which Congress specified that such delay\nmay be automatically excluded. The result is that the\npretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is\nnot automatically excludable.11\n                             B\n  The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into auto\nmatic excludability because \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here,\nsubparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s] of more general appli\ncation\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991). In arguing\nthat this principle applies, but requires a result different\nfrom the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government\nand several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in\na manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.\n                              1\n  There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more\nspecific than the \u201cgeneral\u201d language in subsection (h)(1),\npost, at 2, 6, or that \u201c[g]eneral language of a statutory\nprovision, although broad enough to include it, will not be\nheld to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another\npart of the same enactment,\u201d D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v.\nPopkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). We part company with\nthe dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D)\ngoverns the period of delay at issue in this case. The\ndissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground\nthat it is foreclosed by the statute.

This argument takes aim at an exagger\nated target. Because we conclude that the type of delay at\nissue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can\nin future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries,\na result that is not certain even in this case. See infra, at\n17\u201318. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on\nremand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify read\ning subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to\n\u201cother proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d) to permit\nautomatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any\ndecision to continue a deadline.\n   The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because\nthe provision\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto\u201d shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclu\nsion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated\nsubparagraphs. See post, at 3; see also United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument\nconfuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s list of\ncategories of excludable delay (each of which is repre\nsented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the catego\nries themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative\nrather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclu\nsion that a delay that falls within the category of delay\naddressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits\nin that subparagraph. The \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d\nclause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to\nmodify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list\nitself. As noted, such a reading would violate settled\nprinciples of statutory construction because it would ig\n12                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnore the structure and grammar of subsection (h)(1), and\nin so doing render even the clearest of the subparagraphs\nindeterminate and virtually superfluous. See Gozlon-\nPeretz, supra, at 410; Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167,\n174 (2001) (\u201c[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence,\nor word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)). Our reading avoids these\nproblems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing\neach of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, con\nclusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates other\nwise, see, e.g., \u00a73161(h)(1)(A); supra, at 9, the automatic\nexcludability of the delay resulting from the category of\nproceedings it addresses.\n   The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)\u2019s\nlimits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we\nshould automatically exclude the delay at issue here under\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s opening clause, see post, at 2, because it\nis not \u201cclear\u201d that the delay is governed by the more spe\ncific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D). Post,\nat 5. We decline this invitation to use the alleged uncer\ntainty in subparagraph (D)\u2019s scope as a justification for\ndisregarding its limits and instead expanding, through\nliberal interpretation of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s generic opening\nclause,12 what the dissent itself describes as the automatic\nexclusion \u201cexceptio[n]\u201d to the Act\u2019s 70-day period and the\nAct\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d requiring \u201cends-of-justice findings for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The dissent argues that the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d in this case is the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s disposition of petitioner\u2019s motion for additional time to\nfile pretrial motions. See post, at 2. If that were correct, any order\ndisposing of a motion\u2014including a pretrial motion under subparagraph\n(D)\u2014would be a separate \u201cproceeding,\u201d and any resulting delay would\nbe automatically excludable. The dissent\u2019s reading renders superflu\nous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the\nexclusion of time necessary for \u201cadequate preparation for pretrial\nproceedings,\u201d      \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii),  and    \u201ceffective    preparation,\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

The problem with this\nreading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection\n(h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the\ndefinition of a \u201cproceeding concerning the defendant,\u201d and\nthus threatens the Act\u2019s manifest purpose of ensuring\nspeedy trials by construing the Act\u2019s automatic exclusion\nexceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day\nrule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled,\nby the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon\nwhich the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the pros\npect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in\nthis case. Hence our conclusion that the text and struc\nture of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion\nof the delay at issue in this case.\n                               2\n   Our conclusion is further supported by subsection\n(h)(1)\u2019s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).\nSubsection (h)(7) provides that delays \u201cresulting from a\ncontinuance granted by any judge\u201d may be excluded, but\nonly if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends of justice served by\ntaking such action outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial\u201d and records those\nfindings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify\na continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice\nrecognized the importance of adequate pretrial prepara\ntion time. See \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court\nto consider whether the \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d nature of a\ncase makes it \u201cunreasonable to expect adequate prepara\ntion for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within\nthe time limits\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv)\n14                   BLOATE v.

Our determination that the\ndelay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives\nfull effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions\nfor excluding certain types of delay only where district\ncourt makes findings justifying the exclusion.13 Cf. post,\nat 11\u201312 (construing subsection (h)(1) in a manner that\ncould encompass, and govern, delays expressly within\nsubsection (h)(7)\u2019s purview).\n                              3\n  Finally, our Speedy Trial Act precedents support our\nreading of subsection (h)(1). We recently explained that\nthe Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to\nvindicate the public interest in the swift administration of\njustice. We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of\nthe Act even if he believes it would be in his interest;\n\u201c[a]llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine\nthe Act because there are many cases . . . in which the\nprosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy\nto opt out of the Act, to the detriment of the public inter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Had Congress wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\n\ntime automatically, it could have said so. As noted, subsection (h)(7)\ntwice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances\nthat a court may grant in the interests of justice.                   See\n\u00a7\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv). Congress easily could have referred to\npreparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1). See, e.g., Speedy Trial\nAct Amendments Act of 1979, H. R. 3630, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75(c)\n(1979) (proposing to exclude under subparagraph (D) all \u201cdelay result\ning from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses\nand from hearings thereon\u201d (emphasis added)). Congress did not do so,\nand we are bound to enforce only the language that Congress and the\nPresident enacted.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

S. 489, 502 (2006).14\n   Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to\nexclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time\nhave reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to\nprovide defendants adequate time to build their defense.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Mobile Materials, Inc., 871 F. 2d\n902, 913 (per curiam), opinion supplemented on other\ngrounds on rehearing, 881 F. 2d 866 (CA10 1989) (per\ncuriam). Yet these same courts have recognized that\nreading subsection (h)(1) to exclude all time for preparing\npretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a\nspeedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have\nrecognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or\nboth parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.\nSee Zedner, supra, at 502.

Tibboel, 753\nF. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)\u2014these courts have found it\nnecessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion\nfor pretrial motion preparation time that their interpreta\ntion of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow. See, e.g.,\nibid. (stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be\nautomatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when\n\u201cthe judge has expressly granted a party time for that\npurpose\u201d (emphasis added)); Oberoi, 547 F. 3d, at 450\n(\u201cThis . . . qualification prevents abuse.

In Henderson v.\nUnited States, 476 U. S. 321, 322 (1986), for example, we carefully\nexamined the text of \u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (now codified as subparagraph (D))\nto determine whether certain periods of pretrial motion-related delay\nwere automatically excludable. Such careful parsing would seem\nunnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not\nconclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the\ncategory of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay\nmay simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).\n16               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparty \u2018could delay trial indefinitely merely by working on\npretrial motions right up to the eve of trial\u2019 \u201d).\n  The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude\npreparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on\nexcludability to avoid \u201ccreating a big loophole in the stat\nute,\u201d Tibboel, supra, at 610, underscores the extent to\nwhich their interpretation\u2014and the dissent\u2019s\u2014strays from\nthe Act\u2019s text and purpose. As noted, subsection (h)(7)\nexpressly accounts for the possibility that a district court\nwould need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate\npreparation time. An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is\nnot automatic, however, and requires specific findings.\nAllowing district courts to exclude automatically such\ndelays would redesign this statutory framework.\n                             C\n   We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that\nhave interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically\npretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a\ncontrary reading of that provision would lay \u201ca trap for\ntrial judges\u201d by forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act\nviolation if they wish to grant a defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time to prepare a pretrial motion, United States\nv. Wilson, 835 F. 2d 1440, 1444 (CADC 1987); see also\nOberoi, supra, at 450.\n   We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to inter\npret the Speedy Trial Act to \u201ctrap\u201d district courts for ac\ncommodating a defendant\u2019s request for additional time to\nprepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this.\nPetitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for\nthe final continuance from February 26 to March 5.

Fortunately, we can abide by the\nlimitations Congress imposed on the statutory rights at\nissue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that\nwould trap trial courts.\n   For the reasons we explained above, neither subpara\ngraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes\ntime granted to prepare pretrial motions. This conclusion\ndoes not lay a \u201ctrap for trial judges\u201d because it limits (in a\nway the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In\nconsidering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of\ntime will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to\ndevote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay\nare justified, given both the statutory and constitutional\nrequirement of speedy trials. Placing these reasons in the\nrecord does not add an appreciable burden on these\njudges. Neither are district courts forced to choose be\ntween rejecting a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare\npretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if\npreparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court\nmay exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it\ngrants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\nfindings \u201cthat the ends of justice served by taking such\naction outweigh the best interest of the public and the\ndefendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Subsection (h)(7) provides\n\u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498,\nand gives district courts \u201cdiscretion\u2014within limits and\nsubject to specific procedures\u2014to accommodate limited\ndelays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The statutory\nscheme thus ensures that district courts may grant neces\nsary pretrial motion preparation time without risking\ndismissal.\n   Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a\ndistrict court may fail to make the findings necessary for\nan exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall\ngain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act\u2019s\n18               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a\nwindfall. A district court may dismiss the charges without\nprejudice, thus allowing the Government to refile charges\nor reindict the defendant. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73162(a)(1). In\nruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district\ncourt should consider, among other factors, the party\nresponsible for the delay. See ibid. (\u201cIn determining\nwhether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the\n[district] court shall consider, among others, each of the\nfollowing factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts\nand circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;\nand the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of\nthis chapter and on the administration of justice\u201d (empha\nsis added)); see also United States v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326,\n343 (1988) (\u201cSeemingly ignored were the brevity of the\ndelay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respon\ndent, as well as respondent\u2019s own illicit contribution to the\ndelay\u201d).\n                             III\n   Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period\nfrom September 7 through October 4, which includes the\nadditional time granted by the District Court for pretrial\nmotion preparation, is not automatically excludable under\nsubsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address\nwhether any portion of that time might have been other\nwise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its\nmerits brief that another provision of the Act could sup\nport exclusion, presenting the argument that September\n25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in\nits brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argu\nment. We therefore do not consider whether any other\nexclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period.\nInstead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion on the understanding that nothing in the opinion\nbars the Eighth Circuit from considering, on remand, the\nGovernment\u2019s argument that the indictment, and convic\ntions under it, remain effective.\n   Bloate moved, on September 7, 2006, to extend the\ndeadline for filing pretrial motions.

The Speedy Trial Act does not\nrequire this strange result.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Speedy Trial Act generally requires a federal crimi\nnal trial to begin within 70 days after the defendant is\ncharged or appears in court, but certain pretrial periods\nare excluded from the 70-day calculation.            See 18\nU. S. C. A. \u00a73161 (2000 ed. and Supp. 2009). The provi\nsion at issue here, \u00a73161(h)(1) (Supp. 2009), automatically\nexcludes \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other pro\nceedings concerning the defendant, including but not\nlimited to\u201d eight specific types of delay that are set out in\nsubparagraphs (A)\u2013(H). Eight Courts of Appeals have\n2                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nheld1\u2014and I agree\u2014that a delay resulting from the grant\ning of a defense request for additional time to complete\npretrial motions is a delay \u201cresulting from [a] proceedin[g]\nconcerning the defendant\u201d and is thus automatically ex\ncluded under \u00a73161(h)(1).\n                              B\n   In considering the question presented here, I begin with\nthe general language of \u00a73161(h)(1), which, as noted,\nautomatically excludes any \u201cdelay resulting from other\nproceedings concerning the defendant.\u201d (For convenience,\nI will refer to this portion of the statute as \u201csubsection\n(h)(1).\u201d) The delay resulting from the granting of a de\nfense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial\nmotions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection\n(h)(1).\n   First, the granting of such a defense request qualifies as\na \u201cproceeding.\u201d A court proceeding is defined as \u201c[a]n act\nor step that is part of a larger action\u201d and \u201can act done by\nthe authority or direction of the court.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic\ntionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (hereinafter Black\u2019s Law). The granting of a\ndefense request for an extension of time to prepare pre\ntrial motions constitutes both \u201c[a]n act or step that is part\nof [the] larger [criminal case]\u201d and \u201can act done by the\nauthority or direction of the court.\u201d Second, delay caused\nby the granting of such an extension is obviously \u201cdelay\nresulting from\u201d the successful extension request.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 United States v.

Subpara\ngraph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that\nare specifically identified as \u201cdelay resulting from [a]\nproceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\u201d but as noted, this\nlist is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto.\u201d \u201cWhen \u2018include\u2019 is utilized, it is generally improper to\nconclude that entities not specifically enumerated are\nexcluded.\u201d 2A N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Stat\nutes and Statutory Construction \u00a747.23, p. 417 (7th ed.\n2007). See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U. S.\n569, 577 (1994); Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S.\n414, 423, n. 9 (1985); Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v.\nBismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941); Black\u2019s\nLaw 831 (\u201cThe participle including typically indicates a\npartial list\u201d). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the\nadditional phrase \u201cnot limited to\u201d reinforces this point.\nSee United States v. Tibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7\n1985).\n   Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase \u201cincluding\nbut not limited to,\u201d the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to\nshow that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the\ngeneral rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court\u2019s\nargument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just \u201cdelay\nresulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D), but\nalso delay resulting from \u201cproceedings involving pretrial\nmotions,\u201d ante, at 8, and n. 9 (emphasis added), and \u201call\npretrial motion-related delay,\u201d ante, at 8 (emphasis added).\nIn the Court\u2019s view, Congress has expressed a judgment\nthat if a period of \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d does not\nfall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it\nis \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district court\n4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfindings.\u201d Ante, at 9. Thus, since subparagraph (D) does\nnot provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the\ngranting of a defense request for more time to prepare\npretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not\nexcluded from the 70-day calculation. The Court\u2019s analy\nsis, however, is not supported by either the text of sub\nparagraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its\nenactment.\n                              D\n   The Court\u2019s argument would have some force if it were\nclear that the delay involved in the present case is \u201cdelay\nresulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). It\ncould then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a\nlegislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion\nof delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay\noccurs during the period \u201cfrom the filing of the motion\nthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d Ibid.2\n   It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue\nin the present case is delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\nmotion.\u201d Ibid.3 The phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d means \u201cpro\nceed[ing], spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect,\nor conclusion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\ntionary 1937 (1971). Thus, delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pre\ntrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 TheCourt hints that the defense\u2019s request for additional time might\nitself be a pretrial motion within the meaning of \u00a73161(h)(1)(D).\nNeither party relies on this theory. The Court of Appeals found that\n\u201cBloate never filed a pretrial motion.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.\n   3 This much is clear from the Court\u2019s own language. The Court writes\n\nthat \u201calthough the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in\nthis case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that\nperiod precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such\ndelay may be automatically excluded.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310 (emphasis added).\nSubparagraph (D) does not speak of delay that results from a \u201cproceed\ning,\u201d ibid.; subsection (h)(1), however, does. See \u00a73161(h)(1).\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmotion. The type of delay involved in the present case,\nhowever, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial\nmotion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time.\nThe particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this\npoint because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.4\n   It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase\n\u201cresulting from\u201d and substitutes a broader phrase of its\nown invention. The Court writes that \u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d that is not captured by subparagraph (D)\u2019s\ntext is \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district\ncourt findings.\u201d Ante, at 9. See also ante, at 8 (\u201cSubpara\ngraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay\nto automatic exclusion\u201d); ante, at 9 (\u201c[O]nly pretrial mo\ntion-related delay \u2018from the filing\u2019 of a motion to the hear\ning or disposition point specified in the provision is auto\nmatically excludable\u201d); ante, at 15, n. 14 (\u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d); ibid. (\u201cpretrial motion-related proceed\nings\u201d). But \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d is not necessar\nily delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion.\n   Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase \u201cre\nsulting from\u201d to mean \u201crelated [to],\u201d see ante, at 9, there\nare at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.\nFirst, because subparagraphs (A)\u2013(H) are meant to be\nillustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as\nlimiting unless the limitation is very clear. Second, the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of subparagraph (D) leads to an\nanomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have in\ntended. Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes\n\u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of, such motion,\u201d it is clear that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 But even if petitioner had filed pretrial motions, the delay resulting\n\nfrom the granting of the extension still would not be delay \u201cresulting\nfrom\u201d the motion.\n6               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsubparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting\nfrom the granting of a prosecution request for additional\ntime to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial motions. The\nCourt has not identified any reason why Congress might\nhave wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay\nresulting from the granting of a prosecution request for\nadditional time to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial mo\ntions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the\ndefendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare those\nvery motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Con\ngress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the\nCourt\u2019s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should\nbe rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply\nonly to delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial motion,\u201d and\nbecause the delay involved here does not result from a\npretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that sub\nparagraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the\nscope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).\n                             E\n  The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the\ncurrent version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the\nsame conclusion. That language was adopted to expand\nthe reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the\nrelevant provision of the Act excluded only \u201cdelay result\ning from hearings on pretrial motions,\u201d 88 Stat. 2078, and\ncourts had interpreted this language literally to exclude\nonly time actually devoted to hearings.

S. Rep. No. 96\u2013\n212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S. Rep.). See also id., at 26.\nCongress\u2019 expansion of the exclusion set out in subpara\ngraph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by\nhearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from\npretrial motions does not support the inference that Con\ngress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to\ncount against the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day period.\n   Contending that Congress could have been more explicit\nif it \u201cwished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\ntime automatically,\u201d the Court cites as an example a\nlegislative proposal by the Department of Justice to pro\nvide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pre\ntrial motions. Ante, at 14, n. 13. The Court is correct that\nCongress did not choose this option, but the Court\u2019s argu\nment misses the point.\n   First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Depart\nment\u2019s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a\nsuccessful defense request for additional time to prepare\npretrial motions. That is the delay in dispute here. In\nstead, the Justice Department\u2019s proposal excluded all\n\u201cdelay resulting from the preparation and service of pre\ntrial motions and responses from hearings thereon.\u201d S.\n961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75 (1979) (as introduced).\n   Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Com\nmittee report for rejecting the Justice Department pro\nposal do not apply when the delay results from the grant\ning of a defense request such as the one at issue here. The\nSenate Committee report noted that, when excluding time\nfor the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be \u201cquite\ndifficult to determine a point at which preparation actu\nally begins.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. But when a district court\ngrants a defendant\u2019s motion for time to prepare pretrial\n8                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmotions, that concern is not present. See United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the impor\ntance of the District Court\u2019s expressly stopping the speedy\ntrial clock to create a point from which to measure prepa\nration time).5 In addition, the Committee expressed the\nview that \u201cin routine cases, preparation time should not be\nexcluded.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. However, cases in which a\ndistrict court accedes to a defense request for more than\nthe usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial\nmotions are by definition not routine.\n   Third, there is no reason why Congress should have\nsupposed that the language that Congress and the Presi\ndent enacted did not reach delay resulting from the grant\ning of the defendant\u2019s request for additional time to pre\npare pretrial motions. As explained above, supra, at 2, 4\u2013\n6, such delay results from a proceeding concerning\nthe defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial\nmotion.\n   In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a de\nfense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial mo\ntions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection\n(h)(1), that automatically excludes delay \u201cresulting from\n[a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant;\u201d (2) the sub\nparagraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase\n\u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d are illustrative, not exhaus\ntive; and (3) neither the text of subparagraph (D) nor the\ncircumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The Court incorrectly states that the Courts of Appeals that have\n\nread subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time for pretrial motions\nhave found it necessary to \u201cimpos[e] extratextual limitations on exclud\nability,\u201d namely, that the trial judge must expressly grant an extension\nof the time for the completion of pretrial motions. See ante, at 16. This\nrequirement, however, springs from the language of subsection (h)(1),\nfor it is the granting of the extension request that constitutes the\n\u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d that triggers the exclusion\nunder subsection (h)(1).

For these reasons, I would hold that the\ndelay in question here is automatically excluded.\n                              II\n  The Court advances several additional arguments in\nsupport of its analysis, but none is persuasive.\n                               A\n  Two of these arguments hinge on the Court\u2019s unjustifia\nbly broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), i.e., that it\ncovers all \u201cpretrial motion-related delay.\u201d First, the Court\nreasons that under a contrary interpretation, \u201ca court\ncould extend by weeks or months, without any finding that\nthe incursion on the Act\u2019s timeliness guarantee is justified,\nthe entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the\nAct sets a default limit of 70 days.\u201d Ante, at 13. But the\nsame is true of the Court\u2019s interpretation. Even under an\ninterpretation that automatically excludes delay \u201conly\nfrom the time a motion is filed through the hearing or\ndisposition point,\u201d ante, at 9, there appears to be no reason\nwhy a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the\nautomatically excludable period of time under subpara\ngraph (D) through any number of means, including: (1)\nextending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see\nUnited States v.

Indeed, in\nHenderson we held that 295 days of delay resulting from\nthe filing of a pretrial motion were automatically exclud\nable, and we noted that \u201cCongress was aware of the\nbreadth of the exclusion it was enacting.\u201d Id., at 327.6\nThe Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary\nto protect the Act\u2019s \u201ctimeliness guarantee,\u201d ante, at 13, is\nillusory.\n   For a similar reason, the Court\u2019s interpretation is not\nsupported by the rule of construction that \u201c \u2018[a] specific\nprovision\u2019 . . . \u2018controls one[s] of more general application.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 10. This rule applies only when specific and\ngeneral statutory provisions conflict. National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534\nU. S. 327, 335\u2013336 (2002). Here, there is no conflict be\ncause, even if subparagraph (D) governs \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom any pretrial motion,\u201d there is no basis for concluding\nthat subparagraph (D) governs all \u201cpretrial motion-related\ndelay.\u201d\n                              B\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s claim, its decision is not sup\nported by \u00a73161(h)(7)(A), which excludes \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom a continuance\u201d provided that the trial court \u201csets\nforth, in the record of the case, . . . its reasons for finding\nthat the ends of justice served by the granting of such\ncontinuance outweigh the best interests of the public and\nthe defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d One might argue that a\ntrial judge grants a \u201ccontinuance\u201d whenever the judge\npostpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 That the delay in Henderson was delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\n\nmotion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D); see 476 U.

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndirect result of a proceeding that falls squarely within the\nlanguage of subsection (h)(1) or one of the specific illustra\ntive subparagraphs that follow. See \u00a73161(h)(7)(A) (\u201c[a]ny\nperiod of delay resulting from a continuance\u201d). But such a\nreading would render subsection (h)(1) and subparagraphs\n(A)\u2013(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances\nrequired ends-of-justice findings. The plain terms of\nsubsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that\nCongress intended for some periods of delay that postpone\nthe trial date to be automatically excludable.\n   Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its\nsubparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for con\ntinuances. See, e.g., United States v. Aviles-Alvarez, 868\nF. 2d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial\nmotion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court\n\u201cdoes not have to make findings or consider any factors\u201d).\nA period of delay resulting from a continuance requires\nends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall\nwithin the subset of automatically excludable delay de\nfined by subsection (h)(1). When a period of delay result\ning from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclu\nsion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more\nspecific provisions of subsection (h)(1). See Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (\u201cA specific\nprovision controls over one of more general application\u201d).\nCf. ante, at 10.\n   For the reasons discussed, see supra, at 2, the granting\nof a defense request for an extension of time to complete\npretrial motions is a \u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defen\ndant\u201d within the meaning of subsection (h)(1). It may also\nqualify as a \u201ccontinuance\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back\nthe trial date. But a court should resolve the conflict by\napplying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1).\nThis result is faithful not only to the plain language of the\n12               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nstatute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of\nexceptions to the general rule that continuances require\nends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when\ndefense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions\ncannot be completed within the time allotted and is\ngranted an extension, it will generally go without saying\nthat the judge has considered whether the ends of justice\nwill be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to\nrecite this determination on the record will often be an\nempty exercise.\n                              III\n   The Court does not believe that its interpretation will\nhave serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by\nmaking the on-the-record findings required under\n\u00a73161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the grant\ning of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial\nmotions. As this case illustrates, however, there will be\ncases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges\nwill fail to make those findings, and indictments will be\ndismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the\nrecord were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have\nprovided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category\nof delay encompassed by \u00a73161(h)(1).\n   The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation\noccurs because of delay caused by an extension requested\nby the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment\nwithout prejudice. But as we have recognized, even when\na new indictment may be obtained, \u201csubstantial delay may\nwell make reprosecution . . . unlikely.\u201d United States v.\nTaylor, 487 U. S. 326, 342 (1988). Dismissal without\nprejudice is \u201cnot a toothless sanction,\u201d ibid., and it is\nparticularly inappropriate when brought about by a crimi\nnal defendant\u2019s own delay.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                             IV\n  For these reasons, I would hold that the delay at issue\nin this case is automatically excluded for Speedy Trial Act\npurposes, and I would therefore affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n</pre>",
