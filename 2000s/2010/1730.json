Argued January 19, 2010—Decided March 2, 2010*\nThe Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) limits the circumstances\n  in which franchisors may “terminate” a service-station franchise or\n  “fail to renew” a franchise relationship. 15 U. S. C. §§2802, 2804.\n  Typically, the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee\n  and permits the franchisee to use the franchisor’s trademark and\n  purchase the franchisor’s fuel for resale. §2801(1). As relevant here,\n  service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging\n  that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively “ter\n  minate[d]” their franchises and constructively “fail[ed] to renew”\n  their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental\n  terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for\n  many of them. The dealers asserted these claims even though they\n  had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though\n  they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements. The\n  jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District\n  Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law. The\n  First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, hold\n  ing that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its fran\n  chise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple\n  breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\n  amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a mate\n  rial change effectively ending the lease. However, the court reversed\n  as to the constructive nonrenewal claims, holding that such a claim\n  cannot be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–372, Shell Oil Products Co.

SHELL OIL \n\n                        PRODUCTS CO.                                      \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    renewal agreement.\nHeld:\n    1. A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under\n the Act if the franchisor’s allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel\n the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Pp. 6–15.\n       (a) The Act provides that “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate\n any franchise,” except for an enumerated reason and after giving\n written notice, §2802(a)–(b), and specifies that “ ‘termination’ in\n cludes cancellation,” §2801(17). Because it does not further define\n those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: “put [to] an\n end” or “annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Thus, the Act prohibits only fran\n chisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise. The same\n conclusion follows even if Congress used “terminate” and “cancel” in\n their technical, rather than ordinary, senses. This conclusion is also\n consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termi\n nation doctrine as applied in analogous legal contexts—e.g., employ\n ment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129,\n 141–143—where a termination is deemed “constructive” only because\n the plaintiff, not the defendant, formally ends a particular legal rela\n tionship—not because there is no end to the relationship at all. Al\n lowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a\n franchise to end would ignore the Act’s scope, which is limited to the\n circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or de\n cline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state\n law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchi\n sors and franchisees, see §2806(a). This conclusion is also informed\n by important practical considerations, namely, that any standard for\n identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\n tively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee continues to op\n erate, would be indeterminate and unworkable. Pp. 6–12.\n       (b) The dealers’ claim that this interpretation of the Act fails to\n provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchi\n sor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise ignores the\n availability of state-law remedies to address such wrongful conduct.\n The Court’s reading of the Act is also faithful to the statutory inter\n pretation principle that statutes should be construed “in a manner\n that gives effect to all of their provisions,” United States ex rel. Eisen\n stein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, because this interpreta\n tion gives meaningful effect to the Act’s preliminary injunction provi\n sions and its alternative statute-of-limitations accrual dates. Pp. 12–\n 14.\n    2. A franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\n with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim\n under the Act. The Act’s text leaves no room for such an interpreta\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. It is violated only when a franchisor “fail[s] to renew” a fran\n  chise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the\n  required notice, see §2802, and it defines “fail to renew” as a “failure\n  to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship,”\n  §2801(14). A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry\n  the threshold burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela\n  tionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the\n  franchisor has violated the Act. Signing their renewal agreements\n  “under protest” did not preserve the dealers’ ability to assert nonre\n  newal claims. When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement—even\n  “under protest”—there has been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus no\n  violation of the Act. The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this in\n  terpretation. Accepting the dealers’ contrary reading would greatly\n  expand the Act’s reach.

In these consolidated cases, service-station fran\nchisees brought suit under the Act, alleging that a fran\nchisor had constructively “terminate[d]” their franchises\nand had constructively “fail[ed] to renew” their franchise\nrelationships.

Additionally, we conclude that a fran\nchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\nwith a franchisor may not maintain a claim for construc\ntive nonrenewal. We therefore reverse in part and affirm\nin part.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to\nthe public through service stations that often are operated\nby independent franchisees. In the typical franchise\narrangement, the franchisor leases the service-station\npremises to the franchisee, grants the franchisee the right\nto use the franchisor’s trademark, and agrees to sell motor\nfuel to the franchisee for resale. Franchise agreements\nremain in effect for a stated term, after which the parties\ncan opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a\nnew agreement.\n  Enacted in 1978, the PMPA was a response to wide\nspread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly un\nfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petro\nleum industry. See, e.g., Comment, 1980 Duke L. J. 522,\n524–531. The Act establishes minimum federal standards\ngoverning the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchises. Under the Act’s operative provisions, a fran\nchisor may “terminate” a “franchise” during the term\nstated in the franchise agreement and may “fail to renew”\na “franchise relationship” at the conclusion of that term\nonly if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the\naction in question for a reason specifically recognized in\nthe statute. 15 U. S. C. §§2802, 2804. Consistent with the\ntypical franchise arrangement, a “franchise” is defined as\n“any contract” that authorizes a franchisee to use the\nfranchisor’s trademark, as well as any associated agree\nment providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The Act defines a “franchise rela\ntionship” in more general terms: the parties’ “respective\nmotor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and re\nsponsibilities” that result from the franchise arrangement.\n§2801(2).\n   To enforce these provisions, a franchisee may bring suit\nin federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply\nwith the Act’s restrictions on terminations and nonrenew\nals. See §2805. Successful franchisees can benefit from a\nwide range of remedies, including compensatory and\npunitive damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and expert\ncosts, and equitable relief. See §2805(b), (d). The Act also\nrequires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive\nrelief to aggrieved franchisees, if there are “sufficiently\nserious questions going to the merits” that present “a fair\nground for litigation” and the balance of hardships favors\nsuch relief. §2805(b)(2).\n                             B\n  This litigation involves a dispute between Shell Oil\nCompany (Shell), a petroleum franchisor, and several\nShell franchisees in Massachusetts.2 Pursuant to their\nfranchise agreements with Shell, each franchisee was\nrequired to pay Shell monthly rent for use of the service\nstation premises. For many years, Shell offered the fran\nchisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a\nset amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold\nabove a specified threshold. Shell renewed the subsidy\nannually through notices that “explicitly provided for\n——————\n   1 Courts sometimes describe these three types of agreements as the\n\n“statutory elements” of a petroleum franchise. See, e.g., Marcoux v.\nShell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 37, n. 1 (CA1 2008).\n   2 Shell Oil Products Company LLC, another party in this litigation, is\n\na wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company. See Brief for Peti\ntioners in No. 08–372, p. iii.\n4          MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                      PRODUCTS CO.                                \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncancellation [of the rent subsidy] with thirty days’ notice.”\nMarcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 38 (CA1\n2008). Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various\noral representations to the franchisees “that the [s]ubsidy\nor something like it would always exist.” Ibid.\n   In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to\ncreate Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture\nthat combined the companies’ petroleum-marketing opera\ntions in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell as\nsigned to Motiva its rights and obligations under the\nrelevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two\nactions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1,\n2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus\nincreasing the franchisees’ rent. Id., at 38. Second, as\neach franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the\nfranchisees new agreements that contained a different\nformula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the\nfranchisees, annual rent was greater under the new\nformula.\n                             C\n   In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers)\nfiled suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District\nCourt. Their complaint alleged that Motiva’s discontinua\ntion of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract\nunder state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two\nclaims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell\nand Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had “con\nstructively terminated” their franchises in violation of the\nAct. Second, they claimed that Motiva’s offer of new fran\nchise agreements that calculated rent using a different\nformula amounted to a “constructive nonrenewal” of their\nfranchise relationships.3\n——————\n  3 The dealers also claimed that Shell and Motiva had violated the\n\nUniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting\nunreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   After a 2-week trial involving eight of the dealers, the\njury found against Shell and Motiva on all claims. Both\nbefore and after the jury’s verdict, Shell and Motiva moved\nfor judgment as a matter of law on the dealers’ two PMPA\nclaims. They argued that they could not be found liable\nfor constructive termination under the Act because none of\nthe dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to\nMotiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy––something Shell\nand Motiva said was a necessary element of any construc\ntive termination claim. Similarly, they argued that the\ndealers’ constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed\nbecause seven of the eight dealers had signed and oper\nated under renewal agreements with Motiva, and the\neighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his\nfranchise agreement. The District Court denied these\nmotions, and Shell and Motiva appealed.\n   The First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nIn affirming the judgment on the dealers’ constructive\ntermination claims, the Court of Appeals held that a fran\nchisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover\nfor constructive termination under the PMPA. See 524\nF. 3d, at 45–47. Instead, the court ruled, a simple breach\nof contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\namount to constructive termination under the Act, so long\nas the breach resulted in “such a material change that it\neffectively ended the lease, even though the [franchisee]\ncontinued to operate [its franchise].” Id., at 46 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Turning to the dealers’ con\nstructive nonrenewal claims, the First Circuit agreed with\nShell and Motiva that a franchisee cannot maintain a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA “where\nthe franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal\n—————— \n\nagreements with the dealers. The jury found in favor of the dealers on \n\nthis claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 524 F. 3d, at 51. That\n\nissue is not before us. \n\n6               MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                           PRODUCTS CO.                                     \n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\nagreement complained of.” Id., at 49. The court thus\nreversed the judgment on those claims.\n  We granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  The first question we are asked to decide is whether a\nservice-station franchisee may recover for constructive\ntermination under the PMPA when the franchisor’s alleg\nedly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to\nabandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we\nconclude that a necessary element of any constructive\ntermination claim under the Act is that the franchisor’s\nconduct forced an end to the franchisee’s use of the fran\nchisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchisor’s fuel, or\noccupation of the franchisor’s service station.4\n                             A\n  When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA\nprohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect\nof ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides\nthat “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,”\nexcept for an enumerated reason and after providing\nwritten notice. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)–(b). The Act specifies\nthat “[t]he term ‘termination’ includes cancellation,”\n§2801(17), but it does not further define the term “termi\nnate” or the incorporated term “cancel.” We therefore give\n\n——————\n    4 Becauseresolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases,\nwe need not address Shell and Motiva’s alternative argument that the\nPMPA does not embrace claims for constructive termination at all.\nSeveral Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of\naction for constructive termination. See, e.g., 524 F. 3d, at 44–45 (case\nbelow); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F. 3d 386, 390–391 (CA6 1998); Shukla\nv. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 115 F. 3d 849, 852–853 (CA11 1997).\nOthers have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v.\nShell Oil Co., 343 F. 3d 482, 486–488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76\nAuto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F. 3d 938, 948\n(CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthose terms their ordinary meanings. See Asgrow Seed\nCo. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\n   The word “terminate” ordinarily means “put an end to.”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.\n1957); see also The Random House Dictionary of the Eng\nlish Language 1465 (1967). The term “cancel” carries a\nsimilar meaning: to “annul or destroy.” Webster’s, supra,\nat 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (“to make\nvoid; revoke; annul”). The object of the verb “terminate” is\nthe noun “franchise,” a term the Act defines as “any con\ntract” for the provision of one (or more) of the three ele\nments of a typical petroleum franchise. §2801(1). Thus,\nwhen given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only\nif an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of\nmotor fuel, or lease of a premises is “put [to] an end” or\n“annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Conduct that does not force an\nend to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the\nAct’s plain terms.\n   The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using\nthe words “terminate” and “cancel” in their technical,\nrather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the\nPMPA, those terms had established meanings under the\nUniform Commercial Code.5          Under both definitions,\n——————\n  5 The  difference between a “termination” and a “cancellation” under\nthe Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party\njustifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A “termination”\noccurs when “either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or\nlaw puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.” U. C. C.\n§2–106(3) (1972 ed.). By contrast, a “cancellation” occurs when “either\nparty puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.” §2–106(4).\n  That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to\nspecify that “cancellation[s],” no less than “termination[s],” are covered\nby the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their\ngreater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or\ntechnical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc.\nv. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F. 2d 744, 746–747 (CA1 1991). By\nspecifying that the Act covers “cancellation[s]” as well as “termina\n8           MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                  \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhowever, a “termination” or “cancellation” occurs only\nwhen a contracting party “puts an end to the contract.”\nU. C. C. §2–106(3)–(4) (1972 ed.); see also U. C. C. §2–\n106(3)–(4), 1 U. L. A. 695, 695–696 (2004). Thus, a fran\nchisee who continues operating a franchise—occupying the\nsame premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the\nsame trademark—has not had the franchise “termi\nnate[d]” in either the ordinary or technical sense of the\nword.\n  Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before\nclaiming constructive termination is also consistent with\nthe general understanding of the doctrine of constructive\ntermination. As applied in analogous legal contexts—both\nnow and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA—a\nplaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship\nin order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.\nFor example, courts have long recognized a theory of\nconstructive discharge in the field of employment law. See\nPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141–\n143 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930’s). To recover\nfor constructive discharge, however, an employee gener\nally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann\n& P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1449\n(4th ed. 2007); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law\n§59.05[8] (2009); 2 EEOC Compliance Manual §612.9(a)\n(2008); cf.

Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long\nrecognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Ra\npacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the\nUnited States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general\n—————— \n\ntion[s],” Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for \n\nbreach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a “cancella\n\ntion” rather than a “termination.” \n\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually\nmove out in order to claim constructive eviction. See id.,\nat 75; Glendon, The Transformation of American Land\nlord-Tenant Law, 23 Boston College L. Rev. 503, 513–514\n(1982); 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property §§141, 143 (3d ed.\n1939).6\n   As generally understood in these and other contexts, a\ntermination is deemed “constructive” because it is the\nplaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an\nend to the particular legal relationship—not because there\nis no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why\na different understanding should apply to constructive\ntermination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it\nenacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of\nhow courts applied the doctrine of constructive termina\ntion in these analogous legal contexts. See Fitzgerald v.\nBarnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop, at 11–12). And in the absence of any contrary evi\ndence, we think it reasonable to interpret the Act in a way\nthat is consistent with this well-established body of law.\n   The Court of Appeals was of the view that analogizing to\ndoctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was\ninappropriate because “sunk costs, optimism, and the\n——————\n  6 Before Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true,\nhad held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain\ndeclaratory relief without abandoning the premises—although the court\nobserved that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in\norder to obtain rescission.

Seven Grand\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2225044\"><a href=\"/opinion/2225044/charles-e-burt-inc-v-seven-grand-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129–130, 163 N. E. 2d 4, 7–8 (1959). But as even\nthe dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38, the clear majority of\nauthority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming\nconstructive eviction.\n  For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help\nto the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive\neviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was\n“contrary to the present weight of judicial authority.” 1 Restatement\n(Second) of Property §6.1, Reporter’s Note 1, p. 230 (1976).\n10        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhabit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the\nnew arrangements work, even when the terms have\nchanged so materially as to make success impossible.” 524\nF. 3d, at 46. But surely these same factors compel em\nployees and tenants—no less than service-station franchi\nsees—to try to make their changed arrangements work.\nNonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting\nsuch claims to show an actual severance of the relevant\nlegal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule\nhere.\n  Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief\nfor conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would\nextend the reach of the Act much further than its text and\nstructure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petro\nleum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state\nlaw. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d\n846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277–\n283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not\nregulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relation\nship but instead federalized only the two parts of that\nrelationship with which it was most concerned: the cir\ncumstances in which franchisors may terminate a fran\nchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15\nU. S. C. §2802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861–862. Con\ngress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types\nof disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchi\nsees. See §2806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws\ngoverning franchise terminations or nonrenewals).\n  The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a\nmanner that ignores the Act’s limited scope. On their\nview, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA\nprohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenew\nals, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do\nnot cause an end to the franchise. See Brief for Respon\ndents in No. 08–372, pp. 28–35 (hereinafter Respondents’\nBrief); 524 F. 3d, at 44–47. Reading the Act to prohibit\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsimple breaches of contract, however, would be inconsis\ntent with the Act’s limited purpose and would further\nexpand federal law into a domain traditionally reserved\nfor the States. Without a clearer indication that Congress\nintended to federalize such a broad swath of the law gov\nerning petroleum franchise agreements, we decline to\nadopt an interpretation of the Act that would have such\nsweeping consequences. See, e.g., United States v. Bass,\n404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).7\n   Finally, important practical considerations inform our\ndecision. Adopting the dealers’ reading of the PMPA\nwould require us to articulate a standard for identifying\nthose breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\ntively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee in\nfact continues to use the franchisor’s trademark, purchase\nthe franchisor’s fuel, and occupy the service-station prem\nises.8 We think any such standard would be indetermi\nnate and unworkable. How is a court to determine\n\n——————\n  7 Adopting such a broad reading of the PMPA also would have serious\n\nimplications for run-of-the-mill franchise disputes. The Act requires\ncourts to award attorney’s fees and expert-witness fees in any case in\nwhich a plaintiff recovers more than nominal damages. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2805(d)(1)(C). The Act also permits punitive damages, §2805(d)(1)(B),\na remedy ordinarily not available in breach-of-contract actions, see\nBarnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 187–188 (2002). Accepting the\ndealers’ reading of the statute, therefore, would turn everyday contract\ndisputes into high-stakes affairs.\n  8 The First Circuit, for example, approved of a test that asks whether\n\nthe breach resulted in “such a material change that it effectively ended\nthe lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate [their fran\nchises].” 524 F. 3d, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). That\nstandard, it seems to us, does little more than restate the relevant\nquestion. While we do not decide whether the PMPA contemplates\nclaims for constructive termination, we observe that the Court of\nAppeals’ unwillingness or inability to establish a more concrete stan\ndard underscores the difficulties and inherent contradictions involved\nin crafting a standard for finding a “termination” when no termination\nhas in fact occurred.\n12        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a\nfranchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to\ncontinue its operations? And how is a franchisor to know\nin advance which breaches a court will later determine to\nhave been so serious? The dealers have not provided\nanswers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard\nfor identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts\nto a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements\nremain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.\n                              B\n   The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the\nPMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed\nprotection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct\nthat does not force an end to the franchise. That argu\nment, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have\nstate-law remedies available to them. The pre-emptive\nscope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only\nthose state or local laws that govern the termination of\npetroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchise relationships. See 15 U. S. C. §2806(a). Outside\nof those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on\nstate-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct\nthat does not have the effect of ending the franchise.\nIndeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers\nargued in the District Court that Motiva’s elimination of\nthe rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their\nfranchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to\na breach of contract under state law. The jury found in\ntheir favor on their state-law claims and awarded them\nalmost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376–379. Thus,\nthe dealers’ own experience demonstrates that franchisees\ndo not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protec\ntion from abusive franchisor conduct.\n   The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the\nPMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provi\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsions of the Act meaningless. Respondents’ Brief 21–22,\n24–25. While we agree that we normally should construe\nstatutes “in a manner that gives effect to all of their provi\nsions,” we believe our interpretation is faithful to this\n“well-established principl[e] of statutory interpretation.”\nUnited States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)\n   To begin, the dealers insist that our reading of the term\n“terminate” will require franchisees to go out of business\nbefore they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will\nrender useless the Act’s preliminary injunction mecha\nnism. We disagree. To obtain a preliminary injunction, it\nis true, a franchisee must show, among other things, that\n“the franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.”\n15 U. S. C. §2805(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). But that\ndoes not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of\nbusiness before obtaining an injunction. For example, in\ncases of actual termination, the Act requires franchisors to\nprovide franchisees with written notice of termination well\nin advance of the date on which the termination “takes\neffect.” §2804(a). A franchisee that receives notice of\ntermination “has been terminated” within the meaning of\n§2805(b)(2)(A)(i), even though the termination “takes\neffect” on a later date, just as an employee who receives\nnotice of discharge can be accurately described as having\nbeen discharged, even though the employee’s last day at\nwork may perhaps be weeks later. Thus, franchisees that\nreceive notice of impending termination can invoke the\nprotections of the Act’s preliminary injunction mechanism\nwell before having to go out of business.9 Contrary to the\n——————\n  9 The Government reads the Act to permit a dealer to seek prelimi\n\nnary injunctive relief if a franchisor announces its “intent to engage in\nconduct that would leave the franchisee no reasonable alternative but\nto abandon” one (or more) of the franchise elements. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21. Because we do not decide whether the\nPMPA permits constructive termination claims at all, see n. 4, supra,\n14          MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                   \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndealers’ assertions, therefore, our interpretation of the Act\ngives meaningful effect to the PMPA’s preliminary injunc\ntion provisions.\n   Our interpretation also gives effect to the Act’s alterna\ntive statute-of-limitations accrual dates. The 1-year limi\ntations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later\nof either (1) “the date of termination of the franchise” or\n(2) “the date the franchisor fails to comply with the re\nquirements of” the Act. §2805(a). Some violations of the\nPMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has\nbeen terminated. See, e.g., §2802(d)(1) (franchisor must\nshare with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation\naward when the termination was the result of a condem\nnation or taking); §2802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a\nfranchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was\nterminated due to the destruction of the service station\nand the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second ac\ncrual date listed in §2805(a), therefore, shows only that\nthe limitations period runs from the date of these types of\npost-termination violations. It does not suggest that\nCongress intended franchisees to maintain claims under\nthe PMPA to redress franchisor conduct that does not\nforce an end to the franchise.\n                         *     *    *\n  We therefore hold that a necessary element of any con\nstructive termination claim under the PMPA is that the\ncomplained-of conduct forced an end to the franchisee’s\nuse of the franchisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchi\nsor’s fuel, or occupation of the franchisor’s service station.\nBecause none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned\nany element of their franchise operations in response to\nMotiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy,10 they cannot\n——————\nwe need not address this argument.\n  10 After Motiva withdrew the rent subsidy, seven of the dealers con\n\ntinued operating their franchises for the full terms of their franchise\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmaintain a constructive termination claim on the basis of\nthat conduct.\n                            III\n  The second question we are asked to decide is whether a\nfranchisee who is offered and signs a renewal agreement\ncan nonetheless maintain a claim for “constructive nonre\nnewal” under the PMPA. For reasons similar to those\ngiven above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a\nfranchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement\ncannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal\nunder the Act.11\n  The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a fran\nchisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined\n——————\nagreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the\nsubsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316–321 (Mac’s Shell Service, Inc.); id., at\n138–139, 314–315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154–155, 310–311 (Akmal,\nInc.); id., at 185–186, 268–269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312–313 (J &\nM Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179–182, 322–323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at\n148–153, 324–325 (John A. Sullivan). These dealers necessarily cannot\nestablish that the elimination of the subsidy “terminate[d]” their\nfranchises “prior to the conclusion of the term” stated in their franchise\nagreements. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations\nafter their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant.\nIndeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for\nconstructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agree\nments. See Appellees’ Brief in No. 05–2770 etc. (CA1), p. 40, n. 29.\n  One dealer did leave his franchise before his franchise agreement\nexpired. App. 204, 330–331 (Stephen Pisarczyk). But that dealer not\nonly continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id.,\nat 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with\nMotiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330–331.\nMoreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station\nbusiness before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed\nthat his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva’s rent policies.\nSee id., at 202–207.\n  11 As is true with respect to the dealers’ constructive termination\n\nclaims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the\nAct at all recognizes claims for “constructive nonrenewal.” We there\nfore do not express a view on that question.\n16        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto renew a franchise relationship—constructively or oth\nerwise—when the franchisee has in fact accepted a new\nfranchise agreement. As relevant here, a franchisor vio\nlates the PMPA only when it “fail[s] to renew” a franchise\nrelationship for a reason not provided for in the Act or\nafter not providing the required notice. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2802. The Act defines the term “fail to renew,” in turn,\nas a “failure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise\nrelationship.” §2801(14). Thus, the threshold require\nment of any unlawful nonrenewal action—a requirement\nthe franchisee bears the burden of establishing, see\n§2805(c)—is that the franchisor did not “reinstate, con\ntinue, or renew” the franchise relationship once a fran\nchise agreement expired. But if a franchisee signs a re\nnewal agreement, the franchisor clearly has “reinstate[d],\ncontinue[d], or extend[ed]” the franchise relationship.\nTrue, the franchisee might find some of the terms in the\nnew agreement objectionable. But the Act prohibits only\nunlawful “fail[ures] to renew” a franchise relationship, not\nrenewals of a franchise relationship on terms that are less\nthan favorable to the franchisee. A franchisee that signs a\nrenewal agreement, in short, cannot carry the threshold\nburden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela\ntionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish\nthat the franchisor has violated the Act.\n   The dealers point out that several of them signed their\nrenewal agreements “under protest,” and they argue that\nthey thereby explicitly preserved their ability to assert a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. That\nargument misunderstands the legal significance of signing\na renewal agreement. Signing a renewal agreement does\nnot constitute a waiver of a franchisee’s legal rights—\nsomething that signing “under protest” can sometimes\nhelp avoid. See, e.g., U. C. C. §1–207, 1 U. L. A. 318.\nInstead, signing a renewal agreement negates the very\npossibility of a violation of the PMPA. When a franchisee\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsigns a renewal agreement—even “under protest”—there\nhas been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus the franchisee\nhas no cause of action under the Act. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2805(a).\n   The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this interpreta\ntion. By requiring franchisors to renew only the “franchise\nrelationship,” as opposed to the same franchise agreement,\nsee §2802; see also §2801(2), the PMPA contemplates that\nfranchisors can respond to market demands by proposing\nnew and different terms at the expiration of a franchise\nagreement. To that end, the Act authorizes franchisors to\ndecline to renew a franchise relationship if the franchisee\nrefuses to accept changes or additions that are proposed\n“in good faith and in the normal course of business” and\nthat are not designed to convert the service station to\ndirect operation by the franchisor. §2802(b)(3)(A). Addi\ntionally, the Act creates a procedural mechanism for re\nsolving disputes over the legality of proposed new terms.\nIf the parties cannot agree, the franchisor has the option\nof either modifying the objectionable terms or pursuing\nnonrenewal, in which case it must provide the franchisee\nwith written notice well in advance of the date when the\nnonrenewal takes effect. §2804(a)(2). Once the franchisee\nreceives notice of nonrenewal, it can seek a preliminary\ninjunction under the Act’s relaxed injunctive standard,\nmaintaining the status quo while a court determines the\nlawfulness of the proposed changes. See §2805(b)(2);\nsupra, at 13.12\n——————\n  12 The availability of preliminary injunctive relief under the Act also\nexplains why the dealers are wrong to suggest that our holding will\nforce franchisees “to choose between accepting an unlawful and coercive\ncontract in order to stay in business [or] rejecting it and going out of\nbusiness in order to preserve a cause of action.” Respondents’ Brief 51\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A franchisee presented with\n“unlawful and coercive” terms can simply reject those terms and, if the\nfranchisor pursues nonrenewal, seek a preliminary injunction under\n18          MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                     \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Allowing franchisees to pursue nonrenewal claims even\nafter they have signed renewal agreements would under\nmine this procedural mechanism and, in the process,\nwould frustrate franchisors’ ability to propose new terms.\nUnder the dealers’ theory, franchisees have no incentive to\nobject to burdensome new terms and seek a preliminary\ninjunction if a franchisor pursues nonrenewal. Instead, a\nfranchisee could simply sign the new franchise agreement\nand decide later whether to sue under the PMPA. Fran\nchisees would then have the option of either continuing to\noperate under the new agreement or, if the terms of the\nagreement later proved unfavorable, bringing suit under\nthe PMPA alleging that the newly imposed terms are\nunlawful. And because the PMPA has a 1-year statute of\nlimitations, see §2805(a), franchisees would retain that\noption for the entire first year of a new franchise agree\nment. Accepting the dealers’ argument, therefore, would\ncast a cloud of uncertainty over all renewal agreements\nand could chill franchisors from proposing new terms in\nresponse to changing market conditions and consumer\nneeds.\n   Finally, accepting the dealers’ argument would greatly\nexpand the PMPA’s reach. Under the balance struck by\nthe plain text of the statute, a franchisee faced with objec\ntionable new terms must decide whether challenging those\nterms is worth risking the nonrenewal of the franchise\nrelationship; if the franchisee rejects the terms and the\n——————\nthe Act once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal. Indeed, the\nPMPA substantially relaxes the normal standard for obtaining prelimi\nnary-injunctive relief, §2805(b)(2)(A)(ii), thus allowing a franchisee\nwith anything close to a meritorious claim to obtain relief.\n  It is possible, of course, that a franchisor could fail to renew a fran\nchise relationship without providing the statutorily required notice.\nBut in that circumstance, a franchisee would not only have a surefire\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal, see §2802(b)(1)(A), but also presumably\ncould seek a preliminary injunction forcing the franchisor to resume\nproviding the franchise elements for the duration of the litigation.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfranchisor seeks nonrenewal, the franchisee runs the risk\nthat a court will ultimately determine that the proposed\nterms were lawful under the PMPA. See §2802(b)(3)(A).\nThat risk acts as a restraint, limiting the scope of franchi\nsor liability under the Act to that with which Congress\nwas most concerned: the imposition of arbitrary and un\nreasonable new terms on a franchisee that are designed to\nforce an end to the petroleum franchise relationship. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Comment, 32 Emory L. J., at 277–283. Allow\ning franchisees both to sign a franchise agreement and to\npursue a claim under the PMPA would eliminate that\nrestraint and thus permit franchisees to challenge a much\nbroader range of franchisor conduct—conduct to which the\ndealer might object but not consider so serious as to risk\nthe nonrenewal of the franchise by mounting a legal chal\nlenge. As explained, the PMPA was enacted to address\nthe narrow areas of franchise terminations and nonre\nnewals, not to govern every aspect of the petroleum fran\nchise relationship. See supra, at 10; Dersch Energies, 314\nF. 3d, at 861. We thus decline to adopt an interpretation\nthat would expand the Act in such a fashion.13\n                      *    *    *\n  We hold that a franchisee who is offered and signs a\nrenewed franchise agreement cannot maintain a claim for\nunlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA.

Argued January 19, 2010—Decided March 2, 2010*\nThe Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) limits the circumstances\n  in which franchisors may “terminate” a service-station franchise or\n  “fail to renew” a franchise relationship. 15 U. S. C. §§2802, 2804.\n  Typically, the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee\n  and permits the franchisee to use the franchisor’s trademark and\n  purchase the franchisor’s fuel for resale. §2801(1). As relevant here,\n  service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging\n  that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively “ter\n  minate[d]” their franchises and constructively “fail[ed] to renew”\n  their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental\n  terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for\n  many of them. The dealers asserted these claims even though they\n  had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though\n  they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements. The\n  jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District\n  Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law. The\n  First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, hold\n  ing that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its fran\n  chise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple\n  breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\n  amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a mate\n  rial change effectively ending the lease. However, the court reversed\n  as to the constructive nonrenewal claims, holding that such a claim\n  cannot be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–372, Shell Oil Products Co.

SHELL OIL \n\n                        PRODUCTS CO.                                      \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    renewal agreement.\nHeld:\n    1. A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under\n the Act if the franchisor’s allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel\n the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Pp. 6–15.\n       (a) The Act provides that “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate\n any franchise,” except for an enumerated reason and after giving\n written notice, §2802(a)–(b), and specifies that “ ‘termination’ in\n cludes cancellation,” §2801(17). Because it does not further define\n those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: “put [to] an\n end” or “annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Thus, the Act prohibits only fran\n chisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise. The same\n conclusion follows even if Congress used “terminate” and “cancel” in\n their technical, rather than ordinary, senses. This conclusion is also\n consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termi\n nation doctrine as applied in analogous legal contexts—e.g., employ\n ment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129,\n 141–143—where a termination is deemed “constructive” only because\n the plaintiff, not the defendant, formally ends a particular legal rela\n tionship—not because there is no end to the relationship at all. Al\n lowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a\n franchise to end would ignore the Act’s scope, which is limited to the\n circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or de\n cline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state\n law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchi\n sors and franchisees, see §2806(a). This conclusion is also informed\n by important practical considerations, namely, that any standard for\n identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\n tively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee continues to op\n erate, would be indeterminate and unworkable. Pp. 6–12.\n       (b) The dealers’ claim that this interpretation of the Act fails to\n provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchi\n sor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise ignores the\n availability of state-law remedies to address such wrongful conduct.\n The Court’s reading of the Act is also faithful to the statutory inter\n pretation principle that statutes should be construed “in a manner\n that gives effect to all of their provisions,” United States ex rel. Eisen\n stein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, because this interpreta\n tion gives meaningful effect to the Act’s preliminary injunction provi\n sions and its alternative statute-of-limitations accrual dates. Pp. 12–\n 14.\n    2. A franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\n with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim\n under the Act. The Act’s text leaves no room for such an interpreta\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. It is violated only when a franchisor “fail[s] to renew” a fran\n  chise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the\n  required notice, see §2802, and it defines “fail to renew” as a “failure\n  to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship,”\n  §2801(14). A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry\n  the threshold burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela\n  tionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the\n  franchisor has violated the Act. Signing their renewal agreements\n  “under protest” did not preserve the dealers’ ability to assert nonre\n  newal claims. When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement—even\n  “under protest”—there has been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus no\n  violation of the Act. The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this in\n  terpretation. Accepting the dealers’ contrary reading would greatly\n  expand the Act’s reach.

In these consolidated cases, service-station fran\nchisees brought suit under the Act, alleging that a fran\nchisor had constructively “terminate[d]” their franchises\nand had constructively “fail[ed] to renew” their franchise\nrelationships.

Additionally, we conclude that a fran\nchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\nwith a franchisor may not maintain a claim for construc\ntive nonrenewal. We therefore reverse in part and affirm\nin part.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to\nthe public through service stations that often are operated\nby independent franchisees. In the typical franchise\narrangement, the franchisor leases the service-station\npremises to the franchisee, grants the franchisee the right\nto use the franchisor’s trademark, and agrees to sell motor\nfuel to the franchisee for resale. Franchise agreements\nremain in effect for a stated term, after which the parties\ncan opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a\nnew agreement.\n  Enacted in 1978, the PMPA was a response to wide\nspread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly un\nfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petro\nleum industry. See, e.g., Comment, 1980 Duke L. J. 522,\n524–531. The Act establishes minimum federal standards\ngoverning the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchises. Under the Act’s operative provisions, a fran\nchisor may “terminate” a “franchise” during the term\nstated in the franchise agreement and may “fail to renew”\na “franchise relationship” at the conclusion of that term\nonly if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the\naction in question for a reason specifically recognized in\nthe statute. 15 U. S. C. §§2802, 2804. Consistent with the\ntypical franchise arrangement, a “franchise” is defined as\n“any contract” that authorizes a franchisee to use the\nfranchisor’s trademark, as well as any associated agree\nment providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The Act defines a “franchise rela\ntionship” in more general terms: the parties’ “respective\nmotor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and re\nsponsibilities” that result from the franchise arrangement.\n§2801(2).\n   To enforce these provisions, a franchisee may bring suit\nin federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply\nwith the Act’s restrictions on terminations and nonrenew\nals. See §2805. Successful franchisees can benefit from a\nwide range of remedies, including compensatory and\npunitive damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and expert\ncosts, and equitable relief. See §2805(b), (d). The Act also\nrequires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive\nrelief to aggrieved franchisees, if there are “sufficiently\nserious questions going to the merits” that present “a fair\nground for litigation” and the balance of hardships favors\nsuch relief. §2805(b)(2).\n                             B\n  This litigation involves a dispute between Shell Oil\nCompany (Shell), a petroleum franchisor, and several\nShell franchisees in Massachusetts.2 Pursuant to their\nfranchise agreements with Shell, each franchisee was\nrequired to pay Shell monthly rent for use of the service\nstation premises. For many years, Shell offered the fran\nchisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a\nset amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold\nabove a specified threshold. Shell renewed the subsidy\nannually through notices that “explicitly provided for\n——————\n   1 Courts sometimes describe these three types of agreements as the\n\n“statutory elements” of a petroleum franchise. See, e.g., Marcoux v.\nShell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 37, n. 1 (CA1 2008).\n   2 Shell Oil Products Company LLC, another party in this litigation, is\n\na wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company.

Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 38 (CA1\n2008). Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various\noral representations to the franchisees “that the [s]ubsidy\nor something like it would always exist.” Ibid.\n   In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to\ncreate Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture\nthat combined the companies’ petroleum-marketing opera\ntions in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell as\nsigned to Motiva its rights and obligations under the\nrelevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two\nactions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1,\n2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus\nincreasing the franchisees’ rent. Id., at 38. Second, as\neach franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the\nfranchisees new agreements that contained a different\nformula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the\nfranchisees, annual rent was greater under the new\nformula.\n                             C\n   In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers)\nfiled suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District\nCourt. Their complaint alleged that Motiva’s discontinua\ntion of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract\nunder state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two\nclaims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell\nand Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had “con\nstructively terminated” their franchises in violation of the\nAct. Second, they claimed that Motiva’s offer of new fran\nchise agreements that calculated rent using a different\nformula amounted to a “constructive nonrenewal” of their\nfranchise relationships.3\n——————\n  3 The dealers also claimed that Shell and Motiva had violated the\n\nUniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting\nunreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   After a 2-week trial involving eight of the dealers, the\njury found against Shell and Motiva on all claims. Both\nbefore and after the jury’s verdict, Shell and Motiva moved\nfor judgment as a matter of law on the dealers’ two PMPA\nclaims. They argued that they could not be found liable\nfor constructive termination under the Act because none of\nthe dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to\nMotiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy––something Shell\nand Motiva said was a necessary element of any construc\ntive termination claim. Similarly, they argued that the\ndealers’ constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed\nbecause seven of the eight dealers had signed and oper\nated under renewal agreements with Motiva, and the\neighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his\nfranchise agreement. The District Court denied these\nmotions, and Shell and Motiva appealed.\n   The First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nIn affirming the judgment on the dealers’ constructive\ntermination claims, the Court of Appeals held that a fran\nchisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover\nfor constructive termination under the PMPA. See 524\nF. 3d, at 45–47. Instead, the court ruled, a simple breach\nof contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\namount to constructive termination under the Act, so long\nas the breach resulted in “such a material change that it\neffectively ended the lease, even though the [franchisee]\ncontinued to operate [its franchise].” Id., at 46 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Turning to the dealers’ con\nstructive nonrenewal claims, the First Circuit agreed with\nShell and Motiva that a franchisee cannot maintain a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA “where\nthe franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal\n—————— \n\nagreements with the dealers. The jury found in favor of the dealers on \n\nthis claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 524 F. 3d, at 51. That\n\nissue is not before us. \n\n6               MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                           PRODUCTS CO.                                     \n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\nagreement complained of.” Id., at 49. The court thus\nreversed the judgment on those claims.\n  We granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  The first question we are asked to decide is whether a\nservice-station franchisee may recover for constructive\ntermination under the PMPA when the franchisor’s alleg\nedly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to\nabandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we\nconclude that a necessary element of any constructive\ntermination claim under the Act is that the franchisor’s\nconduct forced an end to the franchisee’s use of the fran\nchisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchisor’s fuel, or\noccupation of the franchisor’s service station.4\n                             A\n  When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA\nprohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect\nof ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides\nthat “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,”\nexcept for an enumerated reason and after providing\nwritten notice. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)–(b). The Act specifies\nthat “[t]he term ‘termination’ includes cancellation,”\n§2801(17), but it does not further define the term “termi\nnate” or the incorporated term “cancel.” We therefore give\n\n——————\n    4 Becauseresolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases,\nwe need not address Shell and Motiva’s alternative argument that the\nPMPA does not embrace claims for constructive termination at all.\nSeveral Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of\naction for constructive termination. See, e.g., 524 F. 3d, at 44–45 (case\nbelow); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F. 3d 386, 390–391 (CA6 1998); Shukla\nv. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 115 F. 3d 849, 852–853 (CA11 1997).\nOthers have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v.\nShell Oil Co., 343 F. 3d 482, 486–488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76\nAuto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F. 3d 938, 948\n(CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthose terms their ordinary meanings. See Asgrow Seed\nCo. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\n   The word “terminate” ordinarily means “put an end to.”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.\n1957); see also The Random House Dictionary of the Eng\nlish Language 1465 (1967). The term “cancel” carries a\nsimilar meaning: to “annul or destroy.” Webster’s, supra,\nat 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (“to make\nvoid; revoke; annul”). The object of the verb “terminate” is\nthe noun “franchise,” a term the Act defines as “any con\ntract” for the provision of one (or more) of the three ele\nments of a typical petroleum franchise. §2801(1). Thus,\nwhen given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only\nif an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of\nmotor fuel, or lease of a premises is “put [to] an end” or\n“annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Conduct that does not force an\nend to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the\nAct’s plain terms.\n   The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using\nthe words “terminate” and “cancel” in their technical,\nrather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the\nPMPA, those terms had established meanings under the\nUniform Commercial Code.5          Under both definitions,\n——————\n  5 The  difference between a “termination” and a “cancellation” under\nthe Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party\njustifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A “termination”\noccurs when “either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or\nlaw puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.” U. C. C.\n§2–106(3) (1972 ed.). By contrast, a “cancellation” occurs when “either\nparty puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.” §2–106(4).\n  That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to\nspecify that “cancellation[s],” no less than “termination[s],” are covered\nby the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their\ngreater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or\ntechnical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc.\nv. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F. 2d 744, 746–747 (CA1 1991). By\nspecifying that the Act covers “cancellation[s]” as well as “termina\n8           MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                  \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhowever, a “termination” or “cancellation” occurs only\nwhen a contracting party “puts an end to the contract.”\nU. C. C. §2–106(3)–(4) (1972 ed.); see also U. C. C. §2–\n106(3)–(4), 1 U. L. A. 695, 695–696 (2004). Thus, a fran\nchisee who continues operating a franchise—occupying the\nsame premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the\nsame trademark—has not had the franchise “termi\nnate[d]” in either the ordinary or technical sense of the\nword.\n  Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before\nclaiming constructive termination is also consistent with\nthe general understanding of the doctrine of constructive\ntermination. As applied in analogous legal contexts—both\nnow and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA—a\nplaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship\nin order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.\nFor example, courts have long recognized a theory of\nconstructive discharge in the field of employment law. See\nPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141–\n143 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930’s). To recover\nfor constructive discharge, however, an employee gener\nally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann\n& P.

Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long\nrecognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Ra\npacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the\nUnited States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general\n—————— \n\ntion[s],” Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for \n\nbreach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a “cancella\n\ntion” rather than a “termination.” \n\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually\nmove out in order to claim constructive eviction. See id.,\nat 75; Glendon, The Transformation of American Land\nlord-Tenant Law, 23 Boston College L. Rev. 503, 513–514\n(1982); 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property §§141, 143 (3d ed.\n1939).6\n   As generally understood in these and other contexts, a\ntermination is deemed “constructive” because it is the\nplaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an\nend to the particular legal relationship—not because there\nis no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why\na different understanding should apply to constructive\ntermination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it\nenacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of\nhow courts applied the doctrine of constructive termina\ntion in these analogous legal contexts. See Fitzgerald v.\nBarnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop, at 11–12). And in the absence of any contrary evi\ndence, we think it reasonable to interpret the Act in a way\nthat is consistent with this well-established body of law.\n   The Court of Appeals was of the view that analogizing to\ndoctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was\ninappropriate because “sunk costs, optimism, and the\n——————\n  6 Before Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true,\nhad held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain\ndeclaratory relief without abandoning the premises—although the court\nobserved that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in\norder to obtain rescission. See Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand\nCorp., 340 Mass. 124, 129–130, 163 N. E. 2d 4, 7–8 (1959). But as even\nthe dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38, the clear majority of\nauthority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming\nconstructive eviction.\n  For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help\nto the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive\neviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was\n“contrary to the present weight of judicial authority.” 1 Restatement\n(Second) of Property §6.1, Reporter’s Note 1, p. 230 (1976).\n10        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhabit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the\nnew arrangements work, even when the terms have\nchanged so materially as to make success impossible.” 524\nF. 3d, at 46. But surely these same factors compel em\nployees and tenants—no less than service-station franchi\nsees—to try to make their changed arrangements work.\nNonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting\nsuch claims to show an actual severance of the relevant\nlegal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule\nhere.\n  Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief\nfor conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would\nextend the reach of the Act much further than its text and\nstructure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petro\nleum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state\nlaw. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d\n846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277–\n283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not\nregulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relation\nship but instead federalized only the two parts of that\nrelationship with which it was most concerned: the cir\ncumstances in which franchisors may terminate a fran\nchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15\nU. S. C. §2802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861–862. Con\ngress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types\nof disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchi\nsees. See §2806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws\ngoverning franchise terminations or nonrenewals).\n  The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a\nmanner that ignores the Act’s limited scope. On their\nview, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA\nprohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenew\nals, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do\nnot cause an end to the franchise. See Brief for Respon\ndents in No. 08–372, pp. 28–35 (hereinafter Respondents’\nBrief); 524 F. 3d, at 44–47. Reading the Act to prohibit\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsimple breaches of contract, however, would be inconsis\ntent with the Act’s limited purpose and would further\nexpand federal law into a domain traditionally reserved\nfor the States. Without a clearer indication that Congress\nintended to federalize such a broad swath of the law gov\nerning petroleum franchise agreements, we decline to\nadopt an interpretation of the Act that would have such\nsweeping consequences. See, e.g., United States v. Bass,\n404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).7\n   Finally, important practical considerations inform our\ndecision. Adopting the dealers’ reading of the PMPA\nwould require us to articulate a standard for identifying\nthose breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\ntively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee in\nfact continues to use the franchisor’s trademark, purchase\nthe franchisor’s fuel, and occupy the service-station prem\nises.8 We think any such standard would be indetermi\nnate and unworkable. How is a court to determine\n\n——————\n  7 Adopting such a broad reading of the PMPA also would have serious\n\nimplications for run-of-the-mill franchise disputes. The Act requires\ncourts to award attorney’s fees and expert-witness fees in any case in\nwhich a plaintiff recovers more than nominal damages. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2805(d)(1)(C). The Act also permits punitive damages, §2805(d)(1)(B),\na remedy ordinarily not available in breach-of-contract actions, see\nBarnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 187–188 (2002). Accepting the\ndealers’ reading of the statute, therefore, would turn everyday contract\ndisputes into high-stakes affairs.\n  8 The First Circuit, for example, approved of a test that asks whether\n\nthe breach resulted in “such a material change that it effectively ended\nthe lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate [their fran\nchises].” 524 F. 3d, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). That\nstandard, it seems to us, does little more than restate the relevant\nquestion. While we do not decide whether the PMPA contemplates\nclaims for constructive termination, we observe that the Court of\nAppeals’ unwillingness or inability to establish a more concrete stan\ndard underscores the difficulties and inherent contradictions involved\nin crafting a standard for finding a “termination” when no termination\nhas in fact occurred.\n12        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a\nfranchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to\ncontinue its operations? And how is a franchisor to know\nin advance which breaches a court will later determine to\nhave been so serious? The dealers have not provided\nanswers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard\nfor identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts\nto a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements\nremain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.\n                              B\n   The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the\nPMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed\nprotection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct\nthat does not force an end to the franchise. That argu\nment, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have\nstate-law remedies available to them. The pre-emptive\nscope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only\nthose state or local laws that govern the termination of\npetroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchise relationships. See 15 U. S. C. §2806(a). Outside\nof those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on\nstate-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct\nthat does not have the effect of ending the franchise.\nIndeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers\nargued in the District Court that Motiva’s elimination of\nthe rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their\nfranchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to\na breach of contract under state law. The jury found in\ntheir favor on their state-law claims and awarded them\nalmost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376–379. Thus,\nthe dealers’ own experience demonstrates that franchisees\ndo not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protec\ntion from abusive franchisor conduct.\n   The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the\nPMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provi\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsions of the Act meaningless. Respondents’ Brief 21–22,\n24–25. While we agree that we normally should construe\nstatutes “in a manner that gives effect to all of their provi\nsions,” we believe our interpretation is faithful to this\n“well-established principl[e] of statutory interpretation.”\nUnited States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)\n   To begin, the dealers insist that our reading of the term\n“terminate” will require franchisees to go out of business\nbefore they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will\nrender useless the Act’s preliminary injunction mecha\nnism. We disagree. To obtain a preliminary injunction, it\nis true, a franchisee must show, among other things, that\n“the franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.”\n15 U. S. C. §2805(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). But that\ndoes not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of\nbusiness before obtaining an injunction. For example, in\ncases of actual termination, the Act requires franchisors to\nprovide franchisees with written notice of termination well\nin advance of the date on which the termination “takes\neffect.” §2804(a). A franchisee that receives notice of\ntermination “has been terminated” within the meaning of\n§2805(b)(2)(A)(i), even though the termination “takes\neffect” on a later date, just as an employee who receives\nnotice of discharge can be accurately described as having\nbeen discharged, even though the employee’s last day at\nwork may perhaps be weeks later. Thus, franchisees that\nreceive notice of impending termination can invoke the\nprotections of the Act’s preliminary injunction mechanism\nwell before having to go out of business.9 Contrary to the\n——————\n  9 The Government reads the Act to permit a dealer to seek prelimi\n\nnary injunctive relief if a franchisor announces its “intent to engage in\nconduct that would leave the franchisee no reasonable alternative but\nto abandon” one (or more) of the franchise elements. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21. Because we do not decide whether the\nPMPA permits constructive termination claims at all, see n. 4, supra,\n14          MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                   \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndealers’ assertions, therefore, our interpretation of the Act\ngives meaningful effect to the PMPA’s preliminary injunc\ntion provisions.\n   Our interpretation also gives effect to the Act’s alterna\ntive statute-of-limitations accrual dates. The 1-year limi\ntations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later\nof either (1) “the date of termination of the franchise” or\n(2) “the date the franchisor fails to comply with the re\nquirements of” the Act. §2805(a). Some violations of the\nPMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has\nbeen terminated. See, e.g., §2802(d)(1) (franchisor must\nshare with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation\naward when the termination was the result of a condem\nnation or taking); §2802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a\nfranchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was\nterminated due to the destruction of the service station\nand the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second ac\ncrual date listed in §2805(a), therefore, shows only that\nthe limitations period runs from the date of these types of\npost-termination violations. It does not suggest that\nCongress intended franchisees to maintain claims under\nthe PMPA to redress franchisor conduct that does not\nforce an end to the franchise.\n                         *     *    *\n  We therefore hold that a necessary element of any con\nstructive termination claim under the PMPA is that the\ncomplained-of conduct forced an end to the franchisee’s\nuse of the franchisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchi\nsor’s fuel, or occupation of the franchisor’s service station.\nBecause none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned\nany element of their franchise operations in response to\nMotiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy,10 they cannot\n——————\nwe need not address this argument.\n  10 After Motiva withdrew the rent subsidy, seven of the dealers con\n\ntinued operating their franchises for the full terms of their franchise\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmaintain a constructive termination claim on the basis of\nthat conduct.\n                            III\n  The second question we are asked to decide is whether a\nfranchisee who is offered and signs a renewal agreement\ncan nonetheless maintain a claim for “constructive nonre\nnewal” under the PMPA. For reasons similar to those\ngiven above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a\nfranchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement\ncannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal\nunder the Act.11\n  The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a fran\nchisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined\n——————\nagreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the\nsubsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316–321 (Mac’s Shell Service, Inc.); id., at\n138–139, 314–315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154–155, 310–311 (Akmal,\nInc.); id., at 185–186, 268–269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312–313 (J &\nM Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179–182, 322–323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at\n148–153, 324–325 (John A. Sullivan). These dealers necessarily cannot\nestablish that the elimination of the subsidy “terminate[d]” their\nfranchises “prior to the conclusion of the term” stated in their franchise\nagreements. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations\nafter their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant.\nIndeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for\nconstructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agree\nments. See Appellees’ Brief in No. 05–2770 etc. (CA1), p. 40, n. 29.\n  One dealer did leave his franchise before his franchise agreement\nexpired. App. 204, 330–331 (Stephen Pisarczyk). But that dealer not\nonly continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id.,\nat 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with\nMotiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330–331.\nMoreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station\nbusiness before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed\nthat his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva’s rent policies.\nSee id., at 202–207.\n  11 As is true with respect to the dealers’ constructive termination\n\nclaims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the\nAct at all recognizes claims for “constructive nonrenewal.” We there\nfore do not express a view on that question.\n16        MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto renew a franchise relationship—constructively or oth\nerwise—when the franchisee has in fact accepted a new\nfranchise agreement. As relevant here, a franchisor vio\nlates the PMPA only when it “fail[s] to renew” a franchise\nrelationship for a reason not provided for in the Act or\nafter not providing the required notice. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2802. The Act defines the term “fail to renew,” in turn,\nas a “failure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise\nrelationship.” §2801(14). Thus, the threshold require\nment of any unlawful nonrenewal action—a requirement\nthe franchisee bears the burden of establishing, see\n§2805(c)—is that the franchisor did not “reinstate, con\ntinue, or renew” the franchise relationship once a fran\nchise agreement expired. But if a franchisee signs a re\nnewal agreement, the franchisor clearly has “reinstate[d],\ncontinue[d], or extend[ed]” the franchise relationship.\nTrue, the franchisee might find some of the terms in the\nnew agreement objectionable. But the Act prohibits only\nunlawful “fail[ures] to renew” a franchise relationship, not\nrenewals of a franchise relationship on terms that are less\nthan favorable to the franchisee. A franchisee that signs a\nrenewal agreement, in short, cannot carry the threshold\nburden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela\ntionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish\nthat the franchisor has violated the Act.\n   The dealers point out that several of them signed their\nrenewal agreements “under protest,” and they argue that\nthey thereby explicitly preserved their ability to assert a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. That\nargument misunderstands the legal significance of signing\na renewal agreement. Signing a renewal agreement does\nnot constitute a waiver of a franchisee’s legal rights—\nsomething that signing “under protest” can sometimes\nhelp avoid. See, e.g., U. C. C. §1–207, 1 U. L. A. 318.\nInstead, signing a renewal agreement negates the very\npossibility of a violation of the PMPA. When a franchisee\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsigns a renewal agreement—even “under protest”—there\nhas been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus the franchisee\nhas no cause of action under the Act. See 15 U. S. C.\n§2805(a).\n   The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this interpreta\ntion. By requiring franchisors to renew only the “franchise\nrelationship,” as opposed to the same franchise agreement,\nsee §2802; see also §2801(2), the PMPA contemplates that\nfranchisors can respond to market demands by proposing\nnew and different terms at the expiration of a franchise\nagreement. To that end, the Act authorizes franchisors to\ndecline to renew a franchise relationship if the franchisee\nrefuses to accept changes or additions that are proposed\n“in good faith and in the normal course of business” and\nthat are not designed to convert the service station to\ndirect operation by the franchisor. §2802(b)(3)(A). Addi\ntionally, the Act creates a procedural mechanism for re\nsolving disputes over the legality of proposed new terms.\nIf the parties cannot agree, the franchisor has the option\nof either modifying the objectionable terms or pursuing\nnonrenewal, in which case it must provide the franchisee\nwith written notice well in advance of the date when the\nnonrenewal takes effect. §2804(a)(2). Once the franchisee\nreceives notice of nonrenewal, it can seek a preliminary\ninjunction under the Act’s relaxed injunctive standard,\nmaintaining the status quo while a court determines the\nlawfulness of the proposed changes. See §2805(b)(2);\nsupra, at 13.12\n——————\n  12 The availability of preliminary injunctive relief under the Act also\nexplains why the dealers are wrong to suggest that our holding will\nforce franchisees “to choose between accepting an unlawful and coercive\ncontract in order to stay in business [or] rejecting it and going out of\nbusiness in order to preserve a cause of action.” Respondents’ Brief 51\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A franchisee presented with\n“unlawful and coercive” terms can simply reject those terms and, if the\nfranchisor pursues nonrenewal, seek a preliminary injunction under\n18          MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                     \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Allowing franchisees to pursue nonrenewal claims even\nafter they have signed renewal agreements would under\nmine this procedural mechanism and, in the process,\nwould frustrate franchisors’ ability to propose new terms.\nUnder the dealers’ theory, franchisees have no incentive to\nobject to burdensome new terms and seek a preliminary\ninjunction if a franchisor pursues nonrenewal. Instead, a\nfranchisee could simply sign the new franchise agreement\nand decide later whether to sue under the PMPA. Fran\nchisees would then have the option of either continuing to\noperate under the new agreement or, if the terms of the\nagreement later proved unfavorable, bringing suit under\nthe PMPA alleging that the newly imposed terms are\nunlawful. And because the PMPA has a 1-year statute of\nlimitations, see §2805(a), franchisees would retain that\noption for the entire first year of a new franchise agree\nment. Accepting the dealers’ argument, therefore, would\ncast a cloud of uncertainty over all renewal agreements\nand could chill franchisors from proposing new terms in\nresponse to changing market conditions and consumer\nneeds.\n   Finally, accepting the dealers’ argument would greatly\nexpand the PMPA’s reach. Under the balance struck by\nthe plain text of the statute, a franchisee faced with objec\ntionable new terms must decide whether challenging those\nterms is worth risking the nonrenewal of the franchise\nrelationship; if the franchisee rejects the terms and the\n——————\nthe Act once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal. Indeed, the\nPMPA substantially relaxes the normal standard for obtaining prelimi\nnary-injunctive relief, §2805(b)(2)(A)(ii), thus allowing a franchisee\nwith anything close to a meritorious claim to obtain relief.\n  It is possible, of course, that a franchisor could fail to renew a fran\nchise relationship without providing the statutorily required notice.\nBut in that circumstance, a franchisee would not only have a surefire\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal, see §2802(b)(1)(A), but also presumably\ncould seek a preliminary injunction forcing the franchisor to resume\nproviding the franchise elements for the duration of the litigation.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfranchisor seeks nonrenewal, the franchisee runs the risk\nthat a court will ultimately determine that the proposed\nterms were lawful under the PMPA. See §2802(b)(3)(A).\nThat risk acts as a restraint, limiting the scope of franchi\nsor liability under the Act to that with which Congress\nwas most concerned: the imposition of arbitrary and un\nreasonable new terms on a franchisee that are designed to\nforce an end to the petroleum franchise relationship. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Comment, 32 Emory L. J., at 277–283. Allow\ning franchisees both to sign a franchise agreement and to\npursue a claim under the PMPA would eliminate that\nrestraint and thus permit franchisees to challenge a much\nbroader range of franchisor conduct—conduct to which the\ndealer might object but not consider so serious as to risk\nthe nonrenewal of the franchise by mounting a legal chal\nlenge. As explained, the PMPA was enacted to address\nthe narrow areas of franchise terminations and nonre\nnewals, not to govern every aspect of the petroleum fran\nchise relationship. See supra, at 10; Dersch Energies, 314\nF. 3d, at 861. We thus decline to adopt an interpretation\nthat would expand the Act in such a fashion.13\n                      *    *    *\n  We hold that a franchisee who is offered and signs a\nrenewed franchise agreement cannot maintain a claim for\nunlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA.
