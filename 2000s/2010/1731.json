MUCHNICK ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013103.     Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nThe Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register\n  their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.\n  \u00a7411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in\n  fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least\n  one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper\n  or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a).\n  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their\n  works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District\n  Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree\n  ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance\n  authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques\n  tion whether \u00a7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris\n  diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,\n  concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the\n  class or approve the settlement.\nHeld: Section 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a precondition to fil\n ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder\u2019s failure to\n comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court\u2019s sub\n ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis\n tered works. Pp. 5\u201316.\n    (a) \u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u201d Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d properly ap\n plies only to \u201cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject\n matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\u201d implicat\n ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic\n tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac\n tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d\n only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered\n2                 REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional if Congress \u201cclearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic\n    tional\u201d; a condition \u201cnot rank[ed]\u201d as such should be treated \u201cas non\n    jurisdictional in character.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n    515\u2013516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity\n    coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was\n    not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not\n    \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,\n    this Court\u2019s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that\n    the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement\u2019s loca\n    tion in a provision separate from Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction-granting sec\n    tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic\n    tional. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, \u00a7411(a)\n    does not \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that its registration requirement is \u201cjurisdic\n    tional.\u201d 546 U. S., at 515. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s last sentence contains\n    the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d that sentence speaks to a court\u2019s adjudicatory\n    authority to determine a copyright claim\u2019s registrability and says\n    nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n    to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More\n    over, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title VII\u2019s employee\n    numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from\n    those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those\n    respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\n    registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak in jurisdictional\n    terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\u2019 \u201d\n    ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee\n    numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a\n    Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n    205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72107\u2019s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice\n    of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed \u00a72107\u2019s\n    specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type\n    of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame\n    work because context is relevant to whether a statute \u201crank[s]\u201d a re\n    quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       (d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec\n    ond Circuit\u2019s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti\n    tioners\u2019 arguments below are in tension with those made in this\n    Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of \u201cin\n    consistent court determinations\u201d in their favor that estoppel is meant\n    to address. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742. Pp. 14\u201315.\n       (e) Because \u00a7411(a) does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

The Court also declines\n  to decide whether \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a mandatory\n  precondition to suit that district courts may or should enforce\n  sua sponte by dismissing copyright infringement claims involving un\n  registered works.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\n(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that a copyright holder\u2019s failure to\ncomply with \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement deprives a\nfederal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o pro\nmote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing\nfor limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .\ntheir . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. Exercising this power,\nCongress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme\ngoverning the existence and scope of \u201c[c]opyright protec\ntion\u201d for \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangi\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nble medium of expression.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7102(a). This\nscheme gives copyright owners \u201cthe exclusive rights\u201d (with\nspecified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or\npublicly perform their works. \u00a7106. \u201cAnyone who violates\nany of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro\nvided\u201d in the Act \u201cis an infringer of the copyright.\u201d\n\u00a7501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright\nowner \u201cis entitled, subject to the requirements of section\n411, to institute an action\u201d for copyright infringement.\n\u00a7501(b) (emphasis added).\n   This case concerns \u201cthe requirements of section 411\u201d to\nwhich \u00a7501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia\nand with certain exceptions, that \u201cno civil action for in\nfringement of the copyright in any United States work\nshall be instituted until preregistration or registration of\nthe copyright claim has been made in accordance with this\ntitle.\u201d1 This provision is part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme.\nIt establishes a condition\u2014copyright registration\u2014that\nplaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe\nment claim and invoking the Act\u2019s remedial provisions.\nWe address whether \u00a7411(a) also deprives federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works.\n                            B\n  The relevant proceedings in this case began after we\nissued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533\nU. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of\nonline databases and print publishers had infringed the\ncopyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the\nauthors\u2019 works electronically without first securing their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Other\n          sections of the Act\u2014principally \u00a7\u00a7408\u2013410\u2014detail the regis\ntration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy\nright holders to register their works, see, e.g., \u00a7410(c); 17 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7412 (2005 ed. and Supp. 2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermission. See id., at 493. In so holding, we affirmed the\nprincipal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe\nment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision in\nTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation.\n   The consolidated complaint alleged that the named\nplaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a\nfreelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,\nthat they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered\ntheir copyrighted works and authors who had not. See\nApp. 94.\n   Because of the growing size and complexity of the law\nsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the\npublishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data\nbases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March\n2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par\nties intended \u201cto achieve a global peace in the publishing\nindustry.\u201d In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases\nCopyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).\n   The parties moved the District Court to certify a class\nfor settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.\nTen freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein\nafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court\noverruled the objections; certified a settlement class of\nfreelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reason\nable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final\njudgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or\nany other party urge the District Court to dismiss the\ncase, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settle\n4              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their\nobjections to the settlement on procedural and substantive\ngrounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Ap\npeals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether\n\u00a7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion over infringement claims involving unregistered\ncopyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve\nthe settlement agreement even though it included unreg\nistered works.\n   Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\nregistration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F. 3d,\nat 121 (citing Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp. v. Goffa Int\u2019l\nCorp., 354 F. 3d 112, 114\u2013115 (CA2 2003); Morris v. Busi\nness Concepts, Inc., 259 F. 3d 65, 72\u201373 (CA2 2001)), the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked\njurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the\ninfringement of unregistered works, and also lacked juris\ndiction to approve a settlement with respect to those\nclaims, 509 F. 3d, at 121 (citing \u201cwidespread agreement\namong the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional\u201d).2\n   Judge Walker dissented. He concluded \u201cthat \u00a7411(a) is\nmore like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-numerosity\nrequirement in Arbaugh [v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500\n(2006)]\u201d than the jurisdictional statutory time limit in\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.

See\nArbaugh, supra, at 511\u2013512 (citing examples); Steel Co.,\n523 U. S., at 91 (same). Our recent cases evince a marked\ndesire to curtail such \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings,\u201d\nibid., which too easily can miss the \u201ccritical difference[s]\u201d\nbetween true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdic\ntional limitations on causes of action, Kontrick, supra, at\n456; see also Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 511.\n   In light of the important distinctions between jurisdic\ntional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see, e.g.,\nid., at 514, we have encouraged federal courts and liti\ngants to \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d clarity by using the term \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d only when it is apposite, Kontrick, supra, at 455.\nIn Arbaugh, we described the general approach to distin\nguish \u201cjurisdictional\u201d conditions from claim-processing\nrequirements or elements of a claim:\n    \u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n    tation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdic\n    tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n    structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n    But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n    tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n    the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d 546\n    U.

We held that it does\nthe latter.\n   Our holding turned principally on our examination of\nthe text of \u00a72000e(b), the section in which Title VII\u2019s nu\nmerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not\n\u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the employee numerosity threshold\non Title VII\u2019s scope \u201ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\u201d Id., at\n515\u2013516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII\ncases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu\nmerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it\nnonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at\n511\u2013513. Similarly, \u00a72000e(b)\u2019s text and structure did not\ndemonstrate that Congress \u201crank[ed]\u201d that requirement as\njurisdictional. See id., at 513\u2013516. As we observed, the\nemployee numerosity requirement is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(3), Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction\ngranting section, distinguishing it from the \u201camount-in\ncontroversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris\ndiction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71332.\u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514\u2013515. Accordingly, the\nnumerosity requirement could not fairly be read to \u201c \u2018speak\nin jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.

We\nthus \u201crefrain[ed] from\u201d construing the numerosity re\nquirement to \u201cconstric[t] \u00a71331 or Title VII\u2019s jurisdictional\nprovision.\u201d Arbaugh, supra, at 515 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   We now apply this same approach to \u00a7411(a).\n                               B\n  Section 411(a) provides:\n    \u201cExcept for an action brought for a violation of the\n    rights of the author under section 106A(a), and sub\n    ject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action\n    for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n8             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the last sentence\nof \u00a7411(a) and contending that the use of the term there\nindicates the jurisdictional cast of \u00a7411(a)\u2019s first sentence\nas well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nsupport of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).\nBut this reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d cannot bear the weight\nthat amicus places upon it. The sentence upon which\namicus relies states:\n     \u201cThe Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her op\n     tion, become a party to the [copyright infringement]\n     action with respect to the issue of registrability of the\n     copyright claim by entering an appearance within\n     sixty days after such service, but the Register\u2019s failure\n     to become a party shall not deprive the court of juris\n     diction to determine that issue.\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis\n     added).\n    Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90\n                       Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 2583, to clarify that a federal court can determine\n\u201cthe issue of registrability of the copyright claim\u201d even if\nthe Register does not appear in the infringement suit.\nThat clarification was necessary because courts had inter\npreted \u00a7411(a)\u2019s precursor provision,4 which imposed a\nsimilar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright\nowners who had been refused registration by the Register\nof Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners\nfirst sought mandamus against the Register.             See\nVacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus\nWatch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640\u2013641 (CA2 1958) (construing\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear\nthat a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to\ndetermine \u201cthat issue,\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis added)\u2014i.e., the\nissue of registrability\u2014regardless of whether the Register\nis a party to the infringement suit. The word \u201cjurisdic\ntion,\u201d as used here, thus says nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\nclaims for infringement of unregistered works.\n   Moreover, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title\nVII\u2019s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from those granting federal courts subject\nmatter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See\nArbaugh, supra, at 514\u2013515. Federal district courts have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331 and 1338. But neither\n\u00a71331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over\nquestions of federal law, nor \u00a71338(a), which is specific to\ncopyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on\nwhether copyright holders have registered their works\nbefore suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515\n(\u201cTitle VII\u2019s jurisdictional provision\u201d does not \u201cspecif[y]\nany threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332\u2019s mone\ntary floor\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 See   Act of Mar. 4, 1909, \u00a712, 35 Stat. 1078.\n10              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak\nin jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515\n(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi\ncantly, \u00a7411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in\nfringement claims involving unregistered works in three\ncircumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where\nthe infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and\nintegrity under \u00a7106A, or where the holder attempted to\nregister the work and registration was refused. Sepa\nrately, \u00a7411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the\nauthor \u201cdeclare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the\nwork\u201d and \u201cmakes registration for the work, if required by\nsubsection (a), within three months after [the work\u2019s] first\ntransmission.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7411(c)(1)\u2013(2). It would be at\nleast unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a\ncondition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5\n   That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be\nconsidered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a\nprerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this\nconclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes\n(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII\u2019s require\nment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis\ncrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil\naction in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455\nU. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1) (establishing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Cf. Zipes, 455 U.

Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002) (\u201c[J]urisdiction\u201d properly\nrefers to a court\u2019s power to hear a case, a matter that \u201ccan never be\nforfeited or waived\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

A statutory condition that requires a party to\ntake some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati\ncally \u201ca jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.\u201d Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional\nanalysis must focus on the \u201clegal character\u201d of the re\nquirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to\nthe condition\u2019s text, context, and relevant historical treat\nment, id., at 393\u2013395; see also National Railroad Passen\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119\u2013121 (2002).\nWe similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types\nof threshold requirements that claimants must complete,\nor exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6\n   The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\nfits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to\nfiling a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is\nnot located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad\nmits of congressionally authorized exceptions.           See\n\u00a7\u00a7411(a)\u2013(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre\ncondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment\nunder our precedents.\n                            C\n  Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.\n205, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach\ntoday. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where\nCongress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 211 (2007) (treating the adminis\n\ntrative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA)\u2014which states that \u201cno action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under \u00a71983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as\nare available are exhausted,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a)\u2014as an affirmative\ndefense even though \u201c[t]here is no question that exhaustion is manda\ntory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought\nin court\u201d); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 93 (2006) (same).\n12              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such\nif that is how the condition consistently has been inter\npreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpreta\ntion. Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a\nfootnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it\nwould be improper to characterize the statutory condition\nas nonjurisdictional because doing so would override \u201c \u2018a\ncentury\u2019s worth of precedent\u2019 \u201d treating \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot\ning Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses\non the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.\n   Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid\nof an express jurisdictional label should be treated as\njurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as\nsuch. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos\ning a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541\n\nU. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express\nstatutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor\nney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.\nAs we explained, the time limit in Scarborough \u201cconcerned \u2018a mode of\nrelief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court\u2019 that already had plenary\njurisdiction.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;\n(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per\ncuriam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time\nlimits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that\ndid not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,\nat 210\u2013211. Kontrick involved \u201ctime constraints applicable to objec\ntions to discharge\u201d in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In\nthat case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(J), the statute\n\u201cconferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,\u201d and observed that\nit did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.\nRather, the \u201ctime constraints applicable to objections to discharge\u201d\nwere contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that\nthey \u201c \u2018shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the\ncourts.\u2019 \u201d See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in\nturn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,\nincluding this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions\nin many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks\na requirement as jurisdictional.\n   In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107, which re\nquires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal\nwithin 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4\nof the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which \u201ccar\nries \u00a72107 into practice.\u201d 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz\ning \u00a72107\u2019s specific language and this Court\u2019s historical\ntreatment of the type of limitation \u00a72107 imposes (i.e.,\nstatutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that\nCongress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic\ntional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of\nstatutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis\ntent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em\nphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions\nas jurisdictional, including in statutes other than \u00a72107,\nand specifically in statutes that predated the creation of\nthe courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and n. 2.\n   Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques\ntion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether \u00a7411(a) itself\nhas long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type\nof limitation that \u00a7411(a) imposes is one that is properly\nranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.\nThe statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we\nhad long held did \u201cspeak in jurisdictional terms\u201d even\nabsent a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d label, and nothing about \u00a72107\u2019s\ntext or context, or the historical treatment of that type of\nlimitation, justified a departure from this view. That was\nnot the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes\nand Arbaugh.\n   Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that\n\u00a7411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u201cclosely parallel[ed]\u201d those in Kontrick. 546 U. S., at 15. \n\n14             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof federal courts. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s historical treatment\nas \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a factor in the analysis, it is not\ndispositive. The other factors discussed above demon\nstrate that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is more\nanalogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid\nered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit\nat issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding\nits prior jurisdictional treatment.9\n                             III\n   Amicus argues that even if \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional,\nwe should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment vacating the District Court\u2019s\norder approving the settlement and dismissing the case.\nAccording to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in\nthese proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic\ntional, and this assertion should estop them from now\nasserting a right to waive objections to the authors\u2019 failure\nto register. Amicus urges us to prevent the parties \u201cfrom\n\u2018playing fast and loose with the courts\u2019 by \u2018deliberately\nchanging positions according to the exigencies of the mo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 This conclusion mirrors our holding in Zipes that Title VII\u2019s EEOC\n\nfiling requirement was nonjurisdictional, even though some of our own\ndecisions had characterized it as jurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 395\n(noting that \u201cthe legal character of the requirement was not at issue in\nthose\u201d earlier cases); see also National Railroad Passenger Corporation\nv. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109, 121 (2002) (relying on the analysis in\nZipes).\n   9 Amicus\u2019 remaining jurisdictional argument\u2014that the policy goals\n\nunderlying copyright registration support construing \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion provisions as jurisdictional, see Amicus Brief 45\u2014is similarly\nunavailing. We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as\njurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional\nobjectives. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515\u2013516\n(2006) (holding that Title VII\u2019s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic\ntional even though it serves the important policy goal of \u201cspar[ing] very\nsmall businesses from Title VII liability\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment.\u2019 \u201d Amicus Brief 58 (quoting New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 750 (2001)).\n   We agree that some statements in the parties\u2019 submis\nsions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in\ntension with their arguments here. But we decline to\napply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp\nshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other\nthings, a \u201cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial accep\ntance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding\nwould create the perception that either the first or the\nsecond court was misled.\u201d Id., at 750 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.\nFirst, the parties made their prior statements when nego\ntiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not\nfault the parties\u2019 lawyers for invoking in the negotiations\nbinding Circuit precedent that supported their clients\u2019\npositions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\u2019\ninterpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when\nthe Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether\n\u00a7411(a) restricted the District Court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of\nAppeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 3a\u20135a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners\u2019\narguments here thus cannot create \u201cinconsistent court\ndeterminations\u201d in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at\n751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold\nthat the District Court had authority to adjudicate the\nparties\u2019 request to approve their settlement.\n                            IV\n  Our holding that \u00a7411(a) does not restrict a federal\ncourt\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for\nus to address the parties\u2019 alternative arguments as to\n16          REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

In concluding that the District Court had\njurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no\nopinion on the settlement\u2019s merits.\n   We also decline to address whether \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit\nthat\u2014like the threshold conditions in Arizona v.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a) (Supp. 2009). That provision, which\ninstructs authors to register their copyrights before com\nmencing suit for infringement, \u201cis a precondition to filing a\nclaim that does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 1. I further agree that Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), is the controlling prece\ndent, see ante, at 6, and that Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205 (2007), does not counsel otherwise. There is, however,\nundeniable tension between the two decisions. Aiming to\nstave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as\n\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and what does not, I set out my under\nstanding of the Court\u2019s opinions in Arbaugh and Bowles,\nand the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.\n   In Arbaugh, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription\nconfining Title VII\u2019s coverage to employers with 15 or\nmore employees, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). After observ\ning that \u201cthe 15-employee threshold . . . \u2018d[id] not speak in\njurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction\nof the district courts,\u2019 \u201d 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)), the\nArbaugh opinion announced and applied a \u201creadily admin\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nistrable bright line\u201d:\n     \u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n     tation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdic\n     tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n     structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n     But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n     tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n     the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap\n     plying that readily administrable bright line to this\n     case, we hold that the threshold number of employees\n     for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\u2019s\n     claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.\u201d 546 U. S.,\n     at 515\u2013516 (citation and footnote omitted).\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous\nArbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would\nthereafter adhere to the \u201cbright line\u201d held dispositive that\nday.\n   Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided\nCourt there held \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d the time\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish\nit as involving a statute setting \u201can employee-numerosity\nrequirement, not a time limit.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211. Section\n2107\u2019s time limits were \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d Bowles explained,\nbecause they were contained in a statute, not merely a\nrule, id., at 210\u2013213, and because \u201c[t]his Court ha[d] long\nheld that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed\ntime is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d id., at 209. Fidel\nity to Arbaugh and similarly reasoned decisions,* the\ndissent in Bowles observed, would have yielded the conclu\nsion that statutory time limits \u201care only jurisdictional if\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * E.g., Eberhart v.

S., at 217 (opinion of Souter, J.).\n   Bowles and Arbaugh can be reconciled without distort\ning either decision, however, on the ground that Bowles\n\u201crel[ied] on a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undis\nturbed by Congress.\u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive\nEngineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment,\nCentral Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13)\n(citing Bowles, 551 U. S., at 209\u2013211). The same is true of\nour decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There\nthe Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that\nthe Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires\nsua sponte consideration of a lawsuit\u2019s timeliness. Id., at\n136 (\u201c[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that\nthis Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,\nits earlier precedent.\u201d).\n   Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the\nconclusion that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional.          Section\n411(a) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in\nany way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh\u2019s \u201creadily administrable bright\nline\u201d is therefore controlling. 546 U.

Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nThe Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register\n  their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.\n  \u00a7411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in\n  fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least\n  one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper\n  or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a).\n  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their\n  works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District\n  Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree\n  ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance\n  authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques\n  tion whether \u00a7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris\n  diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,\n  concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the\n  class or approve the settlement.\nHeld: Section 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a precondition to fil\n ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder\u2019s failure to\n comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court\u2019s sub\n ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis\n tered works. Pp. 5\u201316.\n    (a) \u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u201d Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d properly ap\n plies only to \u201cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject\n matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\u201d implicat\n ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic\n tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac\n tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d\n only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered\n2                 REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional if Congress \u201cclearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic\n    tional\u201d; a condition \u201cnot rank[ed]\u201d as such should be treated \u201cas non\n    jurisdictional in character.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n    515\u2013516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity\n    coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was\n    not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not\n    \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,\n    this Court\u2019s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that\n    the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement\u2019s loca\n    tion in a provision separate from Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction-granting sec\n    tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic\n    tional. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, \u00a7411(a)\n    does not \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that its registration requirement is \u201cjurisdic\n    tional.\u201d 546 U. S., at 515. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s last sentence contains\n    the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d that sentence speaks to a court\u2019s adjudicatory\n    authority to determine a copyright claim\u2019s registrability and says\n    nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n    to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More\n    over, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title VII\u2019s employee\n    numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from\n    those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those\n    respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\n    registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak in jurisdictional\n    terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\u2019 \u201d\n    ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee\n    numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a\n    Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n    205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72107\u2019s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice\n    of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed \u00a72107\u2019s\n    specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type\n    of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame\n    work because context is relevant to whether a statute \u201crank[s]\u201d a re\n    quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       (d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec\n    ond Circuit\u2019s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti\n    tioners\u2019 arguments below are in tension with those made in this\n    Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of \u201cin\n    consistent court determinations\u201d in their favor that estoppel is meant\n    to address.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\n(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that a copyright holder\u2019s failure to\ncomply with \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement deprives a\nfederal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o pro\nmote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing\nfor limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .\ntheir . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. Exercising this power,\nCongress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme\ngoverning the existence and scope of \u201c[c]opyright protec\ntion\u201d for \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangi\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

This\nscheme gives copyright owners \u201cthe exclusive rights\u201d (with\nspecified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or\npublicly perform their works. \u00a7106. \u201cAnyone who violates\nany of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro\nvided\u201d in the Act \u201cis an infringer of the copyright.\u201d\n\u00a7501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright\nowner \u201cis entitled, subject to the requirements of section\n411, to institute an action\u201d for copyright infringement.\n\u00a7501(b) (emphasis added).\n   This case concerns \u201cthe requirements of section 411\u201d to\nwhich \u00a7501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia\nand with certain exceptions, that \u201cno civil action for in\nfringement of the copyright in any United States work\nshall be instituted until preregistration or registration of\nthe copyright claim has been made in accordance with this\ntitle.\u201d1 This provision is part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme.\nIt establishes a condition\u2014copyright registration\u2014that\nplaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe\nment claim and invoking the Act\u2019s remedial provisions.\nWe address whether \u00a7411(a) also deprives federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works.\n                            B\n  The relevant proceedings in this case began after we\nissued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533\nU. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of\nonline databases and print publishers had infringed the\ncopyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the\nauthors\u2019 works electronically without first securing their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Other\n          sections of the Act\u2014principally \u00a7\u00a7408\u2013410\u2014detail the regis\ntration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy\nright holders to register their works, see, e.g., \u00a7410(c); 17 U.

In so holding, we affirmed the\nprincipal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe\nment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision in\nTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation.\n   The consolidated complaint alleged that the named\nplaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a\nfreelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,\nthat they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered\ntheir copyrighted works and authors who had not. See\nApp. 94.\n   Because of the growing size and complexity of the law\nsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the\npublishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data\nbases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March\n2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par\nties intended \u201cto achieve a global peace in the publishing\nindustry.\u201d In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases\nCopyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).\n   The parties moved the District Court to certify a class\nfor settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.\nTen freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein\nafter Muchnick respondents), objected.

See\nArbaugh, supra, at 511\u2013512 (citing examples); Steel Co.,\n523 U. S., at 91 (same). Our recent cases evince a marked\ndesire to curtail such \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings,\u201d\nibid., which too easily can miss the \u201ccritical difference[s]\u201d\nbetween true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdic\ntional limitations on causes of action, Kontrick, supra, at\n456; see also Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 511.\n   In light of the important distinctions between jurisdic\ntional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see, e.g.,\nid., at 514, we have encouraged federal courts and liti\ngants to \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d clarity by using the term \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d only when it is apposite, Kontrick, supra, at 455.\nIn Arbaugh, we described the general approach to distin\nguish \u201cjurisdictional\u201d conditions from claim-processing\nrequirements or elements of a claim:\n    \u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n    tation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdic\n    tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n    structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n    But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n    tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n    the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d 546\n    U. S., at 515\u2013516 (citation and footnote omitted).\n   The plaintiff in Arbaugh brought a claim under Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful\n\u201cfor an employer . . . to discriminate,\u201d inter alia, on the\nbasis of sex. 42 U.

Arbaugh\naddressed whether that employee numerosity requirement\n\u201caffects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, in\nstead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

We held that it does\nthe latter.\n   Our holding turned principally on our examination of\nthe text of \u00a72000e(b), the section in which Title VII\u2019s nu\nmerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not\n\u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the employee numerosity threshold\non Title VII\u2019s scope \u201ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\u201d Id., at\n515\u2013516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII\ncases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu\nmerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it\nnonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at\n511\u2013513. Similarly, \u00a72000e(b)\u2019s text and structure did not\ndemonstrate that Congress \u201crank[ed]\u201d that requirement as\njurisdictional. See id., at 513\u2013516. As we observed, the\nemployee numerosity requirement is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(3), Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction\ngranting section, distinguishing it from the \u201camount-in\ncontroversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris\ndiction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71332.\u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514\u2013515. Accordingly, the\nnumerosity requirement could not fairly be read to \u201c \u2018speak\nin jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.

It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the last sentence\nof \u00a7411(a) and contending that the use of the term there\nindicates the jurisdictional cast of \u00a7411(a)\u2019s first sentence\nas well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nsupport of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).\nBut this reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d cannot bear the weight\nthat amicus places upon it.

See\nVacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus\nWatch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640\u2013641 (CA2 1958) (construing\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear\nthat a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to\ndetermine \u201cthat issue,\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis added)\u2014i.e., the\nissue of registrability\u2014regardless of whether the Register\nis a party to the infringement suit. The word \u201cjurisdic\ntion,\u201d as used here, thus says nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\nclaims for infringement of unregistered works.\n   Moreover, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title\nVII\u2019s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from those granting federal courts subject\nmatter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See\nArbaugh, supra, at 514\u2013515. Federal district courts have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331 and 1338. But neither\n\u00a71331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over\nquestions of federal law, nor \u00a71338(a), which is specific to\ncopyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on\nwhether copyright holders have registered their works\nbefore suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515\n(\u201cTitle VII\u2019s jurisdictional provision\u201d does not \u201cspecif[y]\nany threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.

MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak\nin jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515\n(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi\ncantly, \u00a7411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in\nfringement claims involving unregistered works in three\ncircumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where\nthe infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and\nintegrity under \u00a7106A, or where the holder attempted to\nregister the work and registration was refused. Sepa\nrately, \u00a7411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the\nauthor \u201cdeclare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the\nwork\u201d and \u201cmakes registration for the work, if required by\nsubsection (a), within three months after [the work\u2019s] first\ntransmission.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7411(c)(1)\u2013(2). It would be at\nleast unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a\ncondition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5\n   That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be\nconsidered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a\nprerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this\nconclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes\n(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII\u2019s require\nment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis\ncrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil\naction in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455\nU. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1) (establishing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Cf. Zipes, 455 U.

A statutory condition that requires a party to\ntake some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati\ncally \u201ca jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.\u201d Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional\nanalysis must focus on the \u201clegal character\u201d of the re\nquirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to\nthe condition\u2019s text, context, and relevant historical treat\nment, id., at 393\u2013395; see also National Railroad Passen\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119\u2013121 (2002).\nWe similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types\nof threshold requirements that claimants must complete,\nor exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6\n   The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\nfits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to\nfiling a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is\nnot located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad\nmits of congressionally authorized exceptions.           See\n\u00a7\u00a7411(a)\u2013(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre\ncondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment\nunder our precedents.\n                            C\n  Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.\n205, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach\ntoday. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where\nCongress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.

Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a\nfootnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it\nwould be improper to characterize the statutory condition\nas nonjurisdictional because doing so would override \u201c \u2018a\ncentury\u2019s worth of precedent\u2019 \u201d treating \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot\ning Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses\non the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.\n   Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid\nof an express jurisdictional label should be treated as\njurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as\nsuch. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos\ning a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541\n\nU. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express\nstatutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor\nney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.\nAs we explained, the time limit in Scarborough \u201cconcerned \u2018a mode of\nrelief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court\u2019 that already had plenary\njurisdiction.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;\n(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per\ncuriam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time\nlimits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that\ndid not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,\nat 210\u2013211. Kontrick involved \u201ctime constraints applicable to objec\ntions to discharge\u201d in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In\nthat case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(J), the statute\n\u201cconferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,\u201d and observed that\nit did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U.

C. \u00a72107, which re\nquires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal\nwithin 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4\nof the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which \u201ccar\nries \u00a72107 into practice.\u201d 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz\ning \u00a72107\u2019s specific language and this Court\u2019s historical\ntreatment of the type of limitation \u00a72107 imposes (i.e.,\nstatutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that\nCongress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic\ntional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of\nstatutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis\ntent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em\nphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions\nas jurisdictional, including in statutes other than \u00a72107,\nand specifically in statutes that predated the creation of\nthe courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and n. 2.\n   Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques\ntion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether \u00a7411(a) itself\nhas long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type\nof limitation that \u00a7411(a) imposes is one that is properly\nranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.\nThe statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we\nhad long held did \u201cspeak in jurisdictional terms\u201d even\nabsent a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d label, and nothing about \u00a72107\u2019s\ntext or context, or the historical treatment of that type of\nlimitation, justified a departure from this view. That was\nnot the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes\nand Arbaugh.\n   Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that\n\u00a7411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u201cclosely parallel[ed]\u201d those in Kontrick. 546 U. S., at 15. \n\n14             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof federal courts. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s historical treatment\nas \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a factor in the analysis, it is not\ndispositive. The other factors discussed above demon\nstrate that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is more\nanalogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid\nered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit\nat issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding\nits prior jurisdictional treatment.9\n                             III\n   Amicus argues that even if \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional,\nwe should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment vacating the District Court\u2019s\norder approving the settlement and dismissing the case.\nAccording to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in\nthese proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic\ntional, and this assertion should estop them from now\nasserting a right to waive objections to the authors\u2019 failure\nto register. Amicus urges us to prevent the parties \u201cfrom\n\u2018playing fast and loose with the courts\u2019 by \u2018deliberately\nchanging positions according to the exigencies of the mo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 This conclusion mirrors our holding in Zipes that Title VII\u2019s EEOC\n\nfiling requirement was nonjurisdictional, even though some of our own\ndecisions had characterized it as jurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 395\n(noting that \u201cthe legal character of the requirement was not at issue in\nthose\u201d earlier cases); see also National Railroad Passenger Corporation\nv. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109, 121 (2002) (relying on the analysis in\nZipes).\n   9 Amicus\u2019 remaining jurisdictional argument\u2014that the policy goals\n\nunderlying copyright registration support construing \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion provisions as jurisdictional, see Amicus Brief 45\u2014is similarly\nunavailing. We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as\njurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional\nobjectives. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515\u2013516\n(2006) (holding that Title VII\u2019s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic\ntional even though it serves the important policy goal of \u201cspar[ing] very\nsmall businesses from Title VII liability\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment.\u2019 \u201d Amicus Brief 58 (quoting New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 750 (2001)).\n   We agree that some statements in the parties\u2019 submis\nsions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in\ntension with their arguments here. But we decline to\napply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp\nshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other\nthings, a \u201cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial accep\ntance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding\nwould create the perception that either the first or the\nsecond court was misled.\u201d Id., at 750 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.\nFirst, the parties made their prior statements when nego\ntiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not\nfault the parties\u2019 lawyers for invoking in the negotiations\nbinding Circuit precedent that supported their clients\u2019\npositions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\u2019\ninterpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when\nthe Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether\n\u00a7411(a) restricted the District Court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of\nAppeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 3a\u20135a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners\u2019\narguments here thus cannot create \u201cinconsistent court\ndeterminations\u201d in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at\n751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold\nthat the District Court had authority to adjudicate the\nparties\u2019 request to approve their settlement.\n                            IV\n  Our holding that \u00a7411(a) does not restrict a federal\ncourt\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for\nus to address the parties\u2019 alternative arguments as to\n16          REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

In concluding that the District Court had\njurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no\nopinion on the settlement\u2019s merits.\n   We also decline to address whether \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit\nthat\u2014like the threshold conditions in Arizona v.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a) (Supp. 2009). That provision, which\ninstructs authors to register their copyrights before com\nmencing suit for infringement, \u201cis a precondition to filing a\nclaim that does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 1. I further agree that Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), is the controlling prece\ndent, see ante, at 6, and that Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205 (2007), does not counsel otherwise. There is, however,\nundeniable tension between the two decisions. Aiming to\nstave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as\n\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and what does not, I set out my under\nstanding of the Court\u2019s opinions in Arbaugh and Bowles,\nand the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.\n   In Arbaugh, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription\nconfining Title VII\u2019s coverage to employers with 15 or\nmore employees, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). After observ\ning that \u201cthe 15-employee threshold . . . \u2018d[id] not speak in\njurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction\nof the district courts,\u2019 \u201d 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)), the\nArbaugh opinion announced and applied a \u201creadily admin\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nistrable bright line\u201d:\n     \u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n     tation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdic\n     tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n     structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n     But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n     tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n     the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap\n     plying that readily administrable bright line to this\n     case, we hold that the threshold number of employees\n     for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\u2019s\n     claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.\u201d 546 U. S.,\n     at 515\u2013516 (citation and footnote omitted).\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous\nArbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would\nthereafter adhere to the \u201cbright line\u201d held dispositive that\nday.\n   Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided\nCourt there held \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d the time\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish\nit as involving a statute setting \u201can employee-numerosity\nrequirement, not a time limit.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211. Section\n2107\u2019s time limits were \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d Bowles explained,\nbecause they were contained in a statute, not merely a\nrule, id., at 210\u2013213, and because \u201c[t]his Court ha[d] long\nheld that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed\ntime is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d id., at 209. Fidel\nity to Arbaugh and similarly reasoned decisions,* the\ndissent in Bowles observed, would have yielded the conclu\nsion that statutory time limits \u201care only jurisdictional if\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * E.g., Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam);\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 217 (opinion of Souter, J.).\n   Bowles and Arbaugh can be reconciled without distort\ning either decision, however, on the ground that Bowles\n\u201crel[ied] on a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undis\nturbed by Congress.\u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive\nEngineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment,\nCentral Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13)\n(citing Bowles, 551 U. S., at 209\u2013211). The same is true of\nour decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There\nthe Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that\nthe Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires\nsua sponte consideration of a lawsuit\u2019s timeliness. Id., at\n136 (\u201c[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that\nthis Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,\nits earlier precedent.\u201d).\n   Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the\nconclusion that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional.          Section\n411(a) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in\nany way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh\u2019s \u201creadily administrable bright\nline\u201d is therefore controlling. 546 U.
