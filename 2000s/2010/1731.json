Argued October 7, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010\nThe Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register\n  their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.\n  §411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in\n  fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least\n  one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper\n  or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with §411(a).\n  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their\n  works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District\n  Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree\n  ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance\n  authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques\n  tion whether §411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris\n  diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,\n  concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the\n  class or approve the settlement.\nHeld: Section 411(a)’s registration requirement is a precondition to fil\n ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder’s failure to\n comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court’s sub\n ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis\n tered works. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) “Jurisdiction” refers to “a court’s adjudicatory authority,” Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, “jurisdictional” properly ap\n plies only to “prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject\n matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)” implicat\n ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic\n tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac\n tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term “jurisdictional”\n only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered\n2                 REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional if Congress “clearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic\n    tional”; a condition “not rank[ed]” as such should be treated “as non\n    jurisdictional in character.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n    515–516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity\n    coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was\n    not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not\n    “clearly stat[e]” that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,\n    this Court’s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that\n    the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement’s loca\n    tion in a provision separate from Title VII’s jurisdiction-granting sec\n    tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic\n    tional. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, §411(a)\n    does not “clearly stat[e]” that its registration requirement is “jurisdic\n    tional.” 546 U. S., at 515. Although §411(a)’s last sentence contains\n    the word “jurisdiction,” that sentence speaks to a court’s adjudicatory\n    authority to determine a copyright claim’s registrability and says\n    nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n    to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More\n    over, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title VII’s employee\n    numerosity requirement, is located in a provision “separate” from\n    those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those\n    respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that §411(a)’s\n    registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak in jurisdictional\n    terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,’ ”\n    ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee\n    numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a\n    Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7–11.\n       (c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n    205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28\n    U. S. C. §2107’s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice\n    of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed §2107’s\n    specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type\n    of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame\n    work because context is relevant to whether a statute “rank[s]” a re\n    quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11–14.\n       (d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec\n    ond Circuit’s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti\n    tioners’ arguments below are in tension with those made in this\n    Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of “in\n    consistent court determinations” in their favor that estoppel is meant\n    to address. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742. Pp. 14–15.\n       (e) Because §411(a) does not restrict a federal court’s subject\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

IRVIN\n               MUCHNICK ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 2, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Subject to certain exceptions, the Copyright Act (Act)\nrequires copyright holders to register their works before\nsuing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A. §411(a)\n(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that a copyright holder’s failure to\ncomply with §411(a)’s registration requirement deprives a\nfederal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)’s regis\ntration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power “[t]o pro\nmote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing\nfor limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .\ntheir . . . Writings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Exercising this power,\nCongress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme\ngoverning the existence and scope of “[c]opyright protec\ntion” for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangi\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nble medium of expression.” 17 U. S. C. §102(a). This\nscheme gives copyright owners “the exclusive rights” (with\nspecified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or\npublicly perform their works. §106. “Anyone who violates\nany of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro\nvided” in the Act “is an infringer of the copyright.”\n§501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright\nowner “is entitled, subject to the requirements of section\n411, to institute an action” for copyright infringement.\n§501(b) (emphasis added).\n   This case concerns “the requirements of section 411” to\nwhich §501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia\nand with certain exceptions, that “no civil action for in\nfringement of the copyright in any United States work\nshall be instituted until preregistration or registration of\nthe copyright claim has been made in accordance with this\ntitle.”1 This provision is part of the Act’s remedial scheme.\nIt establishes a condition—copyright registration—that\nplaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe\nment claim and invoking the Act’s remedial provisions.\nWe address whether §411(a) also deprives federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works.\n                            B\n  The relevant proceedings in this case began after we\nissued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533\nU. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of\nonline databases and print publishers had infringed the\ncopyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the\nauthors’ works electronically without first securing their\n——————\n    1 Other\n          sections of the Act—principally §§408–410—detail the regis\ntration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy\nright holders to register their works, see, e.g., §410(c); 17 U. S. C. A.\n§412 (2005 ed. and Supp. 2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermission. See id., at 493. In so holding, we affirmed the\nprincipal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe\nment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision in\nTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation.\n   The consolidated complaint alleged that the named\nplaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a\nfreelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,\nthat they had registered in accordance with §411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered\ntheir copyrighted works and authors who had not. See\nApp. 94.\n   Because of the growing size and complexity of the law\nsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the\npublishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data\nbases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March\n2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par\nties intended “to achieve a global peace in the publishing\nindustry.” In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases\nCopyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).\n   The parties moved the District Court to certify a class\nfor settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.\nTen freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein\nafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court\noverruled the objections; certified a settlement class of\nfreelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reason\nable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final\njudgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or\nany other party urge the District Court to dismiss the\ncase, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settle\n4              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their\nobjections to the settlement on procedural and substantive\ngrounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Ap\npeals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether\n§411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion over infringement claims involving unregistered\ncopyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve\nthe settlement agreement even though it included unreg\nistered works.\n   Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that §411(a)’s\nregistration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F. 3d,\nat 121 (citing Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp. v. Goffa Int’l\nCorp., 354 F. 3d 112, 114–115 (CA2 2003); Morris v. Busi\nness Concepts, Inc., 259 F. 3d 65, 72–73 (CA2 2001)), the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked\njurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the\ninfringement of unregistered works, and also lacked juris\ndiction to approve a settlement with respect to those\nclaims, 509 F. 3d, at 121 (citing “widespread agreement\namong the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional”).2\n   Judge Walker dissented. He concluded “that §411(a) is\nmore like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-numerosity\nrequirement in Arbaugh [v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500\n(2006)]” than the jurisdictional statutory time limit in\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). 509 F. 3d, at 129.\nAccordingly, he reasoned that §411(a)’s registration re\n——————\n    2 See\n        La Resolana Architects, PA v.

See\nArbaugh, supra, at 511–512 (citing examples); Steel Co.,\n523 U. S., at 91 (same). Our recent cases evince a marked\ndesire to curtail such “drive-by jurisdictional rulings,”\nibid., which too easily can miss the “critical difference[s]”\nbetween true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdic\ntional limitations on causes of action, Kontrick, supra, at\n456; see also Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 511.\n   In light of the important distinctions between jurisdic\ntional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see, e.g.,\nid., at 514, we have encouraged federal courts and liti\ngants to “facilitat[e]” clarity by using the term “jurisdic\ntional” only when it is apposite, Kontrick, supra, at 455.\nIn Arbaugh, we described the general approach to distin\nguish “jurisdictional” conditions from claim-processing\nrequirements or elements of a claim:\n    “If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n    tation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdic\n    tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n    structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n    But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n    tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n    the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.” 546\n    U. S., at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).\n   The plaintiff in Arbaugh brought a claim under Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful\n“for an employer . . . to discriminate,” inter alia, on the\nbasis of sex. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). But employees\ncan bring Title VII claims only against employers that\nhave “fifteen or more employees.” §2000e(b). Arbaugh\naddressed whether that employee numerosity requirement\n“affects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, in\nstead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim for relief.” 546 U. S., at 503. We held that it does\nthe latter.\n   Our holding turned principally on our examination of\nthe text of §2000e(b), the section in which Title VII’s nu\nmerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not\n“clearly stat[e]” that the employee numerosity threshold\non Title VII’s scope “count[s] as jurisdictional.” Id., at\n515–516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII\ncases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu\nmerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it\nnonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at\n511–513. Similarly, §2000e(b)’s text and structure did not\ndemonstrate that Congress “rank[ed]” that requirement as\njurisdictional. See id., at 513–516. As we observed, the\nemployee numerosity requirement is located in a provision\n“separate” from §2000e–5(f)(3), Title VII’s jurisdiction\ngranting section, distinguishing it from the “amount-in\ncontroversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris\ndiction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n§1332.” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514–515. Accordingly, the\nnumerosity requirement could not fairly be read to “ ‘speak\nin jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.’ ” Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). We\nthus “refrain[ed] from” construing the numerosity re\nquirement to “constric[t] §1331 or Title VII’s jurisdictional\nprovision.” Arbaugh, supra, at 515 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   We now apply this same approach to §411(a).\n                               B\n  Section 411(a) provides:\n    “Except for an action brought for a violation of the\n    rights of the author under section 106A(a), and sub\n    ject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action\n    for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n8             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

In any case, however, where the\n     deposit, application, and fee required for registration\n     have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper\n     form and registration has been refused, the applicant\n     is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if\n     notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served\n     on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may, at\n     his or her option, become a party to the action with\n     respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright\n     claim by entering an appearance within sixty days af\n     ter such service, but the Register’s failure to become a\n     party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to de\n     termine that issue.”\n   We must consider whether §411(a) “clearly states” that\nits registration requirement is “jurisdictional.” Arbaugh,\nsupra, at 515. It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word “jurisdiction” in the last sentence\nof §411(a) and contending that the use of the term there\nindicates the jurisdictional cast of §411(a)’s first sentence\nas well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nsupport of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).\nBut this reference to “jurisdiction” cannot bear the weight\nthat amicus places upon it. The sentence upon which\namicus relies states:\n     “The Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her op\n     tion, become a party to the [copyright infringement]\n     action with respect to the issue of registrability of the\n     copyright claim by entering an appearance within\n     sixty days after such service, but the Register’s failure\n     to become a party shall not deprive the court of juris\n     diction to determine that issue.” §411(a) (emphasis\n     added).\n    Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90\n                       Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 2583, to clarify that a federal court can determine\n“the issue of registrability of the copyright claim” even if\nthe Register does not appear in the infringement suit.\nThat clarification was necessary because courts had inter\npreted §411(a)’s precursor provision,4 which imposed a\nsimilar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright\nowners who had been refused registration by the Register\nof Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners\nfirst sought mandamus against the Register.             See\nVacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus\nWatch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640–641 (CA2 1958) (construing\n§411(a)’s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear\nthat a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to\ndetermine “that issue,” §411(a) (emphasis added)—i.e., the\nissue of registrability—regardless of whether the Register\nis a party to the infringement suit. The word “jurisdic\ntion,” as used here, thus says nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\nclaims for infringement of unregistered works.\n   Moreover, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title\nVII’s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision\n“separate” from those granting federal courts subject\nmatter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See\nArbaugh, supra, at 514–515. Federal district courts have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1338. But neither\n§1331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over\nquestions of federal law, nor §1338(a), which is specific to\ncopyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on\nwhether copyright holders have registered their works\nbefore suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515\n(“Title VII’s jurisdictional provision” does not “specif[y]\nany threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S. C. §1332’s mone\ntary floor”).\n——————\n 4 See   Act of Mar. 4, 1909, §12, 35 Stat. 1078.\n10              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.\n§411(a)’s registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak\nin jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515\n(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi\ncantly, §411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in\nfringement claims involving unregistered works in three\ncircumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where\nthe infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and\nintegrity under §106A, or where the holder attempted to\nregister the work and registration was refused. Sepa\nrately, §411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the\nauthor “declare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the\nwork” and “makes registration for the work, if required by\nsubsection (a), within three months after [the work’s] first\ntransmission.” 17 U. S. C. §§411(c)(1)–(2). It would be at\nleast unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a\ncondition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5\n   That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be\nconsidered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a\nprerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this\nconclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes\n(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII’s require\nment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis\ncrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil\naction in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455\nU. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1) (establishing\n——————\n  5 Cf. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393–394, 397 (relying on the fact that Con\ngress had “approved” at least some cases awarding Title VII relief to\nclaimants who had not complied with the statute’s Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) filing requirement in holding that the\nfiling requirement was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit); United\nStates v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002) (“[J]urisdiction” properly\nrefers to a court’s power to hear a case, a matter that “can never be\nforfeited or waived”).\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

A statutory condition that requires a party to\ntake some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati\ncally “a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.” Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional\nanalysis must focus on the “legal character” of the re\nquirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to\nthe condition’s text, context, and relevant historical treat\nment, id., at 393–395; see also National Railroad Passen\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119–121 (2002).\nWe similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types\nof threshold requirements that claimants must complete,\nor exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6\n   The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. §411(a)\nfits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to\nfiling a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is\nnot located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad\nmits of congressionally authorized exceptions.           See\n§§411(a)–(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre\ncondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment\nunder our precedents.\n                            C\n  Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.\n205, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach\ntoday. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where\nCongress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as\n——————\n  6 See Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 211 (2007) (treating the adminis\n\ntrative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA)—which states that “no action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under §1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as\nare available are exhausted,” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a)—as an affirmative\ndefense even though “[t]here is no question that exhaustion is manda\ntory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought\nin court”); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 93 (2006) (same).\n12              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such\nif that is how the condition consistently has been inter\npreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpreta\ntion. Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a\nfootnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it\nwould be improper to characterize the statutory condition\nas nonjurisdictional because doing so would override “ ‘a\ncentury’s worth of precedent’ ” treating §411(a)’s registra\ntion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot\ning Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses\non the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.\n   Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid\nof an express jurisdictional label should be treated as\njurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as\nsuch. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos\ning a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7\n——————\n   7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541\n\nU. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express\nstatutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor\nney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.\nAs we explained, the time limit in Scarborough “concerned ‘a mode of\nrelief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court’ that already had plenary\njurisdiction.” 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;\n(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per\ncuriam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time\nlimits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that\ndid not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,\nat 210–211. Kontrick involved “time constraints applicable to objec\ntions to discharge” in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In\nthat case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(J), the statute\n“conferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,” and observed that\nit did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.\nRather, the “time constraints applicable to objections to discharge”\nwere contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that\nthey “ ‘shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the\ncourts.’ ” See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in\nturn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,\nincluding this Court’s interpretation of similar provisions\nin many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks\na requirement as jurisdictional.\n   In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. §2107, which re\nquires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal\nwithin 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4\nof the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which “car\nries §2107 into practice.” 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz\ning §2107’s specific language and this Court’s historical\ntreatment of the type of limitation §2107 imposes (i.e.,\nstatutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that\nCongress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic\ntional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of\nstatutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis\ntent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em\nphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions\nas jurisdictional, including in statutes other than §2107,\nand specifically in statutes that predated the creation of\nthe courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.\n   Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques\ntion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether §411(a) itself\nhas long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type\nof limitation that §411(a) imposes is one that is properly\nranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.\nThe statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we\nhad long held did “speak in jurisdictional terms” even\nabsent a “jurisdictional” label, and nothing about §2107’s\ntext or context, or the historical treatment of that type of\nlimitation, justified a departure from this view. That was\nnot the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes\nand Arbaugh.\n   Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that\n§411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction \n\n—————— \n\n“closely parallel[ed]” those in Kontrick. 546 U. S., at 15. \n\n14             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof federal courts. Although §411(a)’s historical treatment\nas “jurisdictional” is a factor in the analysis, it is not\ndispositive. The other factors discussed above demon\nstrate that §411(a)’s registration requirement is more\nanalogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid\nered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit\nat issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that §411(a)’s regis\ntration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding\nits prior jurisdictional treatment.9\n                             III\n   Amicus argues that even if §411(a) is nonjurisdictional,\nwe should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment vacating the District Court’s\norder approving the settlement and dismissing the case.\nAccording to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in\nthese proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic\ntional, and this assertion should estop them from now\nasserting a right to waive objections to the authors’ failure\nto register. Amicus urges us to prevent the parties “from\n‘playing fast and loose with the courts’ by ‘deliberately\nchanging positions according to the exigencies of the mo\n——————\n   8 This conclusion mirrors our holding in Zipes that Title VII’s EEOC\n\nfiling requirement was nonjurisdictional, even though some of our own\ndecisions had characterized it as jurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 395\n(noting that “the legal character of the requirement was not at issue in\nthose” earlier cases); see also National Railroad Passenger Corporation\nv. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109, 121 (2002) (relying on the analysis in\nZipes).\n   9 Amicus’ remaining jurisdictional argument—that the policy goals\n\nunderlying copyright registration support construing §411(a)’s registra\ntion provisions as jurisdictional, see Amicus Brief 45—is similarly\nunavailing. We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as\njurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional\nobjectives. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515–516\n(2006) (holding that Title VII’s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic\ntional even though it serves the important policy goal of “spar[ing] very\nsmall businesses from Title VII liability”).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment.’ ” Amicus Brief 58 (quoting New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 750 (2001)).\n   We agree that some statements in the parties’ submis\nsions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in\ntension with their arguments here. But we decline to\napply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp\nshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other\nthings, a “party has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial accep\ntance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding\nwould create the perception that either the first or the\nsecond court was misled.” Id., at 750 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.\nFirst, the parties made their prior statements when nego\ntiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not\nfault the parties’ lawyers for invoking in the negotiations\nbinding Circuit precedent that supported their clients’\npositions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners’\ninterpretation of §411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when\nthe Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether\n§411(a) restricted the District Court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of\nAppeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 3a–5a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners’\narguments here thus cannot create “inconsistent court\ndeterminations” in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at\n751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold\nthat the District Court had authority to adjudicate the\nparties’ request to approve their settlement.\n                            IV\n  Our holding that §411(a) does not restrict a federal\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for\nus to address the parties’ alternative arguments as to\n16          REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the District Court had authority to approve the\nsettlement even under the Court of Appeals’ erroneous\nreading of §411. In concluding that the District Court had\njurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no\nopinion on the settlement’s merits.\n   We also decline to address whether §411(a)’s registra\ntion requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit\nthat—like the threshold conditions in Arizona v. Califor\nnia, 530 U. S. 392, 412–413 (2000) (res judicata defense);\nDay v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205–206 (2006) (habeas\nstatute of limitations); and Hallstrom v. Tillamook\nCounty, 493 U.

S. C. A. §411(a) (Supp. 2009). That provision, which\ninstructs authors to register their copyrights before com\nmencing suit for infringement, “is a precondition to filing a\nclaim that does not restrict a federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction.” Ante, at 1. I further agree that Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), is the controlling prece\ndent, see ante, at 6, and that Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205 (2007), does not counsel otherwise. There is, however,\nundeniable tension between the two decisions. Aiming to\nstave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as\n“jurisdictional,” and what does not, I set out my under\nstanding of the Court’s opinions in Arbaugh and Bowles,\nand the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.\n   In Arbaugh, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription\nconfining Title VII’s coverage to employers with 15 or\nmore employees, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). After observ\ning that “the 15-employee threshold . . . ‘d[id] not speak in\njurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction\nof the district courts,’ ” 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)), the\nArbaugh opinion announced and applied a “readily admin\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nistrable bright line”:\n     “If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n     tation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdic\n     tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n     structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n     But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n     tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n     the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap\n     plying that readily administrable bright line to this\n     case, we hold that the threshold number of employees\n     for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff’s\n     claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.” 546 U. S.,\n     at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous\nArbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would\nthereafter adhere to the “bright line” held dispositive that\nday.\n   Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided\nCourt there held “mandatory and jurisdictional” the time\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n§2107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish\nit as involving a statute setting “an employee-numerosity\nrequirement, not a time limit.” 551 U. S., at 211. Section\n2107’s time limits were “jurisdictional,” Bowles explained,\nbecause they were contained in a statute, not merely a\nrule, id., at 210–213, and because “[t]his Court ha[d] long\nheld that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed\ntime is ‘mandatory and jurisdictional,’ ” id., at 209.

The same is true of\nour decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There\nthe Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that\nthe Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires\nsua sponte consideration of a lawsuit’s timeliness. Id., at\n136 (“[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that\nthis Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,\nits earlier precedent.”).\n   Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the\nconclusion that §411(a) is nonjurisdictional.          Section\n411(a) “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in\nany way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.” Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh’s “readily administrable bright\nline” is therefore controlling. 546 U.

Argued October 7, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010\nThe Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register\n  their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.\n  §411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in\n  fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least\n  one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper\n  or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with §411(a).\n  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their\n  works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District\n  Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree\n  ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance\n  authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques\n  tion whether §411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris\n  diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,\n  concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the\n  class or approve the settlement.\nHeld: Section 411(a)’s registration requirement is a precondition to fil\n ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder’s failure to\n comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court’s sub\n ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis\n tered works. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) “Jurisdiction” refers to “a court’s adjudicatory authority,” Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, “jurisdictional” properly ap\n plies only to “prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject\n matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)” implicat\n ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic\n tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac\n tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term “jurisdictional”\n only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered\n2                 REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional if Congress “clearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic\n    tional”; a condition “not rank[ed]” as such should be treated “as non\n    jurisdictional in character.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n    515–516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity\n    coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was\n    not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not\n    “clearly stat[e]” that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,\n    this Court’s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that\n    the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement’s loca\n    tion in a provision separate from Title VII’s jurisdiction-granting sec\n    tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic\n    tional. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, §411(a)\n    does not “clearly stat[e]” that its registration requirement is “jurisdic\n    tional.” 546 U. S., at 515. Although §411(a)’s last sentence contains\n    the word “jurisdiction,” that sentence speaks to a court’s adjudicatory\n    authority to determine a copyright claim’s registrability and says\n    nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n    to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More\n    over, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title VII’s employee\n    numerosity requirement, is located in a provision “separate” from\n    those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those\n    respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that §411(a)’s\n    registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak in jurisdictional\n    terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,’ ”\n    ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee\n    numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a\n    Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7–11.\n       (c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n    205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28\n    U. S. C. §2107’s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice\n    of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed §2107’s\n    specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type\n    of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame\n    work because context is relevant to whether a statute “rank[s]” a re\n    quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11–14.\n       (d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec\n    ond Circuit’s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti\n    tioners’ arguments below are in tension with those made in this\n    Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of “in\n    consistent court determinations” in their favor that estoppel is meant\n    to address. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742. Pp. 14–15.\n       (e) Because §411(a) does not restrict a federal court’s subject\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

S. C. A. §411(a)\n(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that a copyright holder’s failure to\ncomply with §411(a)’s registration requirement deprives a\nfederal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)’s regis\ntration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power “[t]o pro\nmote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing\nfor limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .\ntheir . . . Writings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. Exercising this power,\nCongress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme\ngoverning the existence and scope of “[c]opyright protec\ntion” for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangi\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nble medium of expression.” 17 U. S. C. §102(a). This\nscheme gives copyright owners “the exclusive rights” (with\nspecified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or\npublicly perform their works. §106. “Anyone who violates\nany of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro\nvided” in the Act “is an infringer of the copyright.”\n§501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright\nowner “is entitled, subject to the requirements of section\n411, to institute an action” for copyright infringement.\n§501(b) (emphasis added).\n   This case concerns “the requirements of section 411” to\nwhich §501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia\nand with certain exceptions, that “no civil action for in\nfringement of the copyright in any United States work\nshall be instituted until preregistration or registration of\nthe copyright claim has been made in accordance with this\ntitle.”1 This provision is part of the Act’s remedial scheme.\nIt establishes a condition—copyright registration—that\nplaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe\nment claim and invoking the Act’s remedial provisions.\nWe address whether §411(a) also deprives federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works.\n                            B\n  The relevant proceedings in this case began after we\nissued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533\nU. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of\nonline databases and print publishers had infringed the\ncopyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the\nauthors’ works electronically without first securing their\n——————\n    1 Other\n          sections of the Act—principally §§408–410—detail the regis\ntration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy\nright holders to register their works, see, e.g., §410(c); 17 U. S. C. A.\n§412 (2005 ed. and Supp. 2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermission. See id., at 493. In so holding, we affirmed the\nprincipal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe\nment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision in\nTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation.\n   The consolidated complaint alleged that the named\nplaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a\nfreelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,\nthat they had registered in accordance with §411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered\ntheir copyrighted works and authors who had not. See\nApp. 94.\n   Because of the growing size and complexity of the law\nsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the\npublishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data\nbases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March\n2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par\nties intended “to achieve a global peace in the publishing\nindustry.” In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases\nCopyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).\n   The parties moved the District Court to certify a class\nfor settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.\nTen freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein\nafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court\noverruled the objections; certified a settlement class of\nfreelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reason\nable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final\njudgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or\nany other party urge the District Court to dismiss the\ncase, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settle\n4              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their\nobjections to the settlement on procedural and substantive\ngrounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Ap\npeals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether\n§411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion over infringement claims involving unregistered\ncopyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve\nthe settlement agreement even though it included unreg\nistered works.\n   Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that §411(a)’s\nregistration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F. 3d,\nat 121 (citing Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp. v. Goffa Int’l\nCorp., 354 F. 3d 112, 114–115 (CA2 2003); Morris v. Busi\nness Concepts, Inc., 259 F. 3d 65, 72–73 (CA2 2001)), the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked\njurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the\ninfringement of unregistered works, and also lacked juris\ndiction to approve a settlement with respect to those\nclaims, 509 F. 3d, at 121 (citing “widespread agreement\namong the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional”).2\n   Judge Walker dissented. He concluded “that §411(a) is\nmore like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-numerosity\nrequirement in Arbaugh [v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500\n(2006)]” than the jurisdictional statutory time limit in\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). 509 F. 3d, at 129.\nAccordingly, he reasoned that §411(a)’s registration re\n——————\n    2 See\n        La Resolana Architects, PA v.

See\nArbaugh, supra, at 511–512 (citing examples); Steel Co.,\n523 U. S., at 91 (same). Our recent cases evince a marked\ndesire to curtail such “drive-by jurisdictional rulings,”\nibid., which too easily can miss the “critical difference[s]”\nbetween true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdic\ntional limitations on causes of action, Kontrick, supra, at\n456; see also Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 511.\n   In light of the important distinctions between jurisdic\ntional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see, e.g.,\nid., at 514, we have encouraged federal courts and liti\ngants to “facilitat[e]” clarity by using the term “jurisdic\ntional” only when it is apposite, Kontrick, supra, at 455.\nIn Arbaugh, we described the general approach to distin\nguish “jurisdictional” conditions from claim-processing\nrequirements or elements of a claim:\n    “If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n    tation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdic\n    tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n    structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n    But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n    tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n    the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.” 546\n    U. S., at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).\n   The plaintiff in Arbaugh brought a claim under Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful\n“for an employer . . . to discriminate,” inter alia, on the\nbasis of sex. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). But employees\ncan bring Title VII claims only against employers that\nhave “fifteen or more employees.” §2000e(b). Arbaugh\naddressed whether that employee numerosity requirement\n“affects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, in\nstead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim for relief.” 546 U. S., at 503. We held that it does\nthe latter.\n   Our holding turned principally on our examination of\nthe text of §2000e(b), the section in which Title VII’s nu\nmerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not\n“clearly stat[e]” that the employee numerosity threshold\non Title VII’s scope “count[s] as jurisdictional.” Id., at\n515–516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII\ncases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu\nmerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it\nnonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at\n511–513. Similarly, §2000e(b)’s text and structure did not\ndemonstrate that Congress “rank[ed]” that requirement as\njurisdictional. See id., at 513–516. As we observed, the\nemployee numerosity requirement is located in a provision\n“separate” from §2000e–5(f)(3), Title VII’s jurisdiction\ngranting section, distinguishing it from the “amount-in\ncontroversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris\ndiction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n§1332.” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514–515. Accordingly, the\nnumerosity requirement could not fairly be read to “ ‘speak\nin jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.’ ” Id., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)). We\nthus “refrain[ed] from” construing the numerosity re\nquirement to “constric[t] §1331 or Title VII’s jurisdictional\nprovision.” Arbaugh, supra, at 515 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   We now apply this same approach to §411(a).\n                               B\n  Section 411(a) provides:\n    “Except for an action brought for a violation of the\n    rights of the author under section 106A(a), and sub\n    ject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action\n    for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n8             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

In any case, however, where the\n     deposit, application, and fee required for registration\n     have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper\n     form and registration has been refused, the applicant\n     is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if\n     notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served\n     on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may, at\n     his or her option, become a party to the action with\n     respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright\n     claim by entering an appearance within sixty days af\n     ter such service, but the Register’s failure to become a\n     party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to de\n     termine that issue.”\n   We must consider whether §411(a) “clearly states” that\nits registration requirement is “jurisdictional.” Arbaugh,\nsupra, at 515. It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word “jurisdiction” in the last sentence\nof §411(a) and contending that the use of the term there\nindicates the jurisdictional cast of §411(a)’s first sentence\nas well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nsupport of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).\nBut this reference to “jurisdiction” cannot bear the weight\nthat amicus places upon it. The sentence upon which\namicus relies states:\n     “The Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her op\n     tion, become a party to the [copyright infringement]\n     action with respect to the issue of registrability of the\n     copyright claim by entering an appearance within\n     sixty days after such service, but the Register’s failure\n     to become a party shall not deprive the court of juris\n     diction to determine that issue.” §411(a) (emphasis\n     added).\n    Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90\n                       Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 2583, to clarify that a federal court can determine\n“the issue of registrability of the copyright claim” even if\nthe Register does not appear in the infringement suit.\nThat clarification was necessary because courts had inter\npreted §411(a)’s precursor provision,4 which imposed a\nsimilar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright\nowners who had been refused registration by the Register\nof Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners\nfirst sought mandamus against the Register.             See\nVacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus\nWatch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640–641 (CA2 1958) (construing\n§411(a)’s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear\nthat a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to\ndetermine “that issue,” §411(a) (emphasis added)—i.e., the\nissue of registrability—regardless of whether the Register\nis a party to the infringement suit. The word “jurisdic\ntion,” as used here, thus says nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\nclaims for infringement of unregistered works.\n   Moreover, §411(a)’s registration requirement, like Title\nVII’s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision\n“separate” from those granting federal courts subject\nmatter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See\nArbaugh, supra, at 514–515. Federal district courts have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1338. But neither\n§1331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over\nquestions of federal law, nor §1338(a), which is specific to\ncopyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on\nwhether copyright holders have registered their works\nbefore suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515\n(“Title VII’s jurisdictional provision” does not “specif[y]\nany threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S. C. §1332’s mone\ntary floor”).\n——————\n 4 See   Act of Mar. 4, 1909, §12, 35 Stat. 1078.\n10              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.\n§411(a)’s registration requirement can be read to “ ‘speak\nin jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515\n(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi\ncantly, §411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in\nfringement claims involving unregistered works in three\ncircumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where\nthe infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and\nintegrity under §106A, or where the holder attempted to\nregister the work and registration was refused. Sepa\nrately, §411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the\nauthor “declare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the\nwork” and “makes registration for the work, if required by\nsubsection (a), within three months after [the work’s] first\ntransmission.” 17 U. S. C. §§411(c)(1)–(2). It would be at\nleast unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a\ncondition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5\n   That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be\nconsidered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a\nprerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this\nconclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes\n(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII’s require\nment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis\ncrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil\naction in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455\nU. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1) (establishing\n——————\n  5 Cf. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393–394, 397 (relying on the fact that Con\ngress had “approved” at least some cases awarding Title VII relief to\nclaimants who had not complied with the statute’s Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) filing requirement in holding that the\nfiling requirement was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit); United\nStates v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002) (“[J]urisdiction” properly\nrefers to a court’s power to hear a case, a matter that “can never be\nforfeited or waived”).\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nspecific time periods within which a discrimination claim\nant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge with the\nEEOC). A statutory condition that requires a party to\ntake some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati\ncally “a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.” Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional\nanalysis must focus on the “legal character” of the re\nquirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to\nthe condition’s text, context, and relevant historical treat\nment, id., at 393–395; see also National Railroad Passen\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119–121 (2002).\nWe similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types\nof threshold requirements that claimants must complete,\nor exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6\n   The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. §411(a)\nfits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to\nfiling a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is\nnot located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad\nmits of congressionally authorized exceptions.           See\n§§411(a)–(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre\ncondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment\nunder our precedents.\n                            C\n  Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.\n205, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach\ntoday. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where\nCongress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as\n——————\n  6 See Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 211 (2007) (treating the adminis\n\ntrative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA)—which states that “no action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under §1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as\nare available are exhausted,” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(a)—as an affirmative\ndefense even though “[t]here is no question that exhaustion is manda\ntory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought\nin court”); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 93 (2006) (same).\n12              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such\nif that is how the condition consistently has been inter\npreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpreta\ntion. Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a\nfootnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it\nwould be improper to characterize the statutory condition\nas nonjurisdictional because doing so would override “ ‘a\ncentury’s worth of precedent’ ” treating §411(a)’s registra\ntion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot\ning Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses\non the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.\n   Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid\nof an express jurisdictional label should be treated as\njurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as\nsuch. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos\ning a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7\n——————\n   7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541\n\nU. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express\nstatutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor\nney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.\nAs we explained, the time limit in Scarborough “concerned ‘a mode of\nrelief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court’ that already had plenary\njurisdiction.” 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;\n(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per\ncuriam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time\nlimits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that\ndid not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,\nat 210–211. Kontrick involved “time constraints applicable to objec\ntions to discharge” in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In\nthat case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. §157(b)(2)(J), the statute\n“conferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,” and observed that\nit did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.\nRather, the “time constraints applicable to objections to discharge”\nwere contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that\nthey “ ‘shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the\ncourts.’ ” See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in\nturn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,\nincluding this Court’s interpretation of similar provisions\nin many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks\na requirement as jurisdictional.\n   In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. §2107, which re\nquires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal\nwithin 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4\nof the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which “car\nries §2107 into practice.” 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz\ning §2107’s specific language and this Court’s historical\ntreatment of the type of limitation §2107 imposes (i.e.,\nstatutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that\nCongress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic\ntional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of\nstatutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis\ntent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em\nphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions\nas jurisdictional, including in statutes other than §2107,\nand specifically in statutes that predated the creation of\nthe courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2.\n   Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques\ntion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether §411(a) itself\nhas long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type\nof limitation that §411(a) imposes is one that is properly\nranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.\nThe statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we\nhad long held did “speak in jurisdictional terms” even\nabsent a “jurisdictional” label, and nothing about §2107’s\ntext or context, or the historical treatment of that type of\nlimitation, justified a departure from this view. That was\nnot the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes\nand Arbaugh.\n   Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that\n§411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction \n\n—————— \n\n“closely parallel[ed]” those in Kontrick. 546 U. S., at 15. \n\n14             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof federal courts. Although §411(a)’s historical treatment\nas “jurisdictional” is a factor in the analysis, it is not\ndispositive. The other factors discussed above demon\nstrate that §411(a)’s registration requirement is more\nanalogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid\nered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit\nat issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that §411(a)’s regis\ntration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding\nits prior jurisdictional treatment.9\n                             III\n   Amicus argues that even if §411(a) is nonjurisdictional,\nwe should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment vacating the District Court’s\norder approving the settlement and dismissing the case.\nAccording to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in\nthese proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic\ntional, and this assertion should estop them from now\nasserting a right to waive objections to the authors’ failure\nto register. Amicus urges us to prevent the parties “from\n‘playing fast and loose with the courts’ by ‘deliberately\nchanging positions according to the exigencies of the mo\n——————\n   8 This conclusion mirrors our holding in Zipes that Title VII’s EEOC\n\nfiling requirement was nonjurisdictional, even though some of our own\ndecisions had characterized it as jurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 395\n(noting that “the legal character of the requirement was not at issue in\nthose” earlier cases); see also National Railroad Passenger Corporation\nv. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109, 121 (2002) (relying on the analysis in\nZipes).\n   9 Amicus’ remaining jurisdictional argument—that the policy goals\n\nunderlying copyright registration support construing §411(a)’s registra\ntion provisions as jurisdictional, see Amicus Brief 45—is similarly\nunavailing. We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as\njurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional\nobjectives. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515–516\n(2006) (holding that Title VII’s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic\ntional even though it serves the important policy goal of “spar[ing] very\nsmall businesses from Title VII liability”).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment.’ ” Amicus Brief 58 (quoting New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 750 (2001)).\n   We agree that some statements in the parties’ submis\nsions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in\ntension with their arguments here. But we decline to\napply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp\nshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other\nthings, a “party has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial accep\ntance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding\nwould create the perception that either the first or the\nsecond court was misled.” Id., at 750 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.\nFirst, the parties made their prior statements when nego\ntiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not\nfault the parties’ lawyers for invoking in the negotiations\nbinding Circuit precedent that supported their clients’\npositions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners’\ninterpretation of §411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when\nthe Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether\n§411(a) restricted the District Court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of\nAppeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 3a–5a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners’\narguments here thus cannot create “inconsistent court\ndeterminations” in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at\n751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold\nthat the District Court had authority to adjudicate the\nparties’ request to approve their settlement.\n                            IV\n  Our holding that §411(a) does not restrict a federal\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for\nus to address the parties’ alternative arguments as to\n16          REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the District Court had authority to approve the\nsettlement even under the Court of Appeals’ erroneous\nreading of §411. In concluding that the District Court had\njurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no\nopinion on the settlement’s merits.\n   We also decline to address whether §411(a)’s registra\ntion requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit\nthat—like the threshold conditions in Arizona v. Califor\nnia, 530 U. S. 392, 412–413 (2000) (res judicata defense);\nDay v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205–206 (2006) (habeas\nstatute of limitations); and Hallstrom v. Tillamook\nCounty, 493 U.

S. C. A. §411(a) (Supp. 2009). That provision, which\ninstructs authors to register their copyrights before com\nmencing suit for infringement, “is a precondition to filing a\nclaim that does not restrict a federal court’s subject-matter\njurisdiction.” Ante, at 1. I further agree that Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), is the controlling prece\ndent, see ante, at 6, and that Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205 (2007), does not counsel otherwise. There is, however,\nundeniable tension between the two decisions. Aiming to\nstave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as\n“jurisdictional,” and what does not, I set out my under\nstanding of the Court’s opinions in Arbaugh and Bowles,\nand the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.\n   In Arbaugh, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription\nconfining Title VII’s coverage to employers with 15 or\nmore employees, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). After observ\ning that “the 15-employee threshold . . . ‘d[id] not speak in\njurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction\nof the district courts,’ ” 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)), the\nArbaugh opinion announced and applied a “readily admin\n2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nistrable bright line”:\n     “If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n     tation on a statute’s scope shall count as jurisdic\n     tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n     structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n     But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n     tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n     the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap\n     plying that readily administrable bright line to this\n     case, we hold that the threshold number of employees\n     for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff’s\n     claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.” 546 U. S.,\n     at 515–516 (citation and footnote omitted).\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous\nArbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would\nthereafter adhere to the “bright line” held dispositive that\nday.\n   Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided\nCourt there held “mandatory and jurisdictional” the time\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n§2107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish\nit as involving a statute setting “an employee-numerosity\nrequirement, not a time limit.” 551 U. S., at 211. Section\n2107’s time limits were “jurisdictional,” Bowles explained,\nbecause they were contained in a statute, not merely a\nrule, id., at 210–213, and because “[t]his Court ha[d] long\nheld that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed\ntime is ‘mandatory and jurisdictional,’ ” id., at 209.

The same is true of\nour decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There\nthe Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that\nthe Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires\nsua sponte consideration of a lawsuit’s timeliness. Id., at\n136 (“[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that\nthis Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,\nits earlier precedent.”).\n   Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the\nconclusion that §411(a) is nonjurisdictional.          Section\n411(a) “does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in\nany way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.” Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh’s “readily administrable bright\nline” is therefore controlling. 546 U.
