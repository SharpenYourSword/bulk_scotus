UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–6925. Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010\nPetitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a\n  convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The Government sought sen\n  tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an\n  enhanced penalty for a person who violates §922(g) and who “has\n  three previous convictions” for “a violent felony,” §924(e)(1), defined\n  as, inter alia, an offense that “has as an element the use . . . of physi\n  cal force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the\n  three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John\n  son’s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a\n  first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b), but was a felony\n  conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of\n  another battery, Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery\n  occurs when a person either “[a]ctually and intentionally touches or\n  strikes another person against [his] will,” or “[i]ntentionally causes\n  bodily harm to another person.” §784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record\n  permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson’s 2003 convic\n  tion rested upon the “strik[ing]” or “[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily\n  harm” elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a\n  predicate conviction for a “violent felony” under the Armed Career\n  Criminal Act only if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another\n  constitutes the use of “physical force” under §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con\n  cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson’s sentence un\n  der §924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Florida felony offense of battery by “[a]ctually and intention\n ally touch[ing]” another person does not have “as an element the use\n . . . of physical force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n and thus does not constitute a “violent felony” under §924(e)(1).\n2                     JOHNSON v.

Hearns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1107651\"><a href=\"/opinion/1107651/state-v-hearns/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218, that, under Florida’s statutory\n    equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. §775.084,\n    the offense of battery does not “involve the use . . . of physical force or\n    violence against any individual,” Fla. Stat. §776.08. The meaning of\n    “physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not\n    state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme\n    Court’s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ\n    ing the Florida Supreme Court’s holding that §784.03(1)(a)’s element\n    of “[a]ctually and intentionally touching” another person is satisfied\n    by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) Because §924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,” the\n    Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,\n    516 U. S. 137, 144–145. The adjective “physical” is clear. The noun\n    “force,” however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning\n    refers to the application of strength, power, and violence—in this con\n    text, against another person. Pp. 4–5.\n       (c) The Government suggests that “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i)’s defi\n    nition of “violent felony” is a legal term of art describing one of the\n    elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that\n    element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al\n    though a common-law term of art should be given its established\n    common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term\n    a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here\n    “physical force” is used in defining not the crime of battery, but\n    rather the statutory category of “violent felony.” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). In\n    that context, “physical force” means violent force—i.e., force capable\n    of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.\n    Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning\n    the Government seeks to impute to the term “force” derives from the\n    elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of\n    §924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that “force” in the definition of a “violent fel\n    ony” should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define\n    the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference\n    about the amount of “force” required by §924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn\n    from §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5–9.\n       (d) There is no force to the Government’s prediction that this deci\n    sion will undermine its ability to enforce §922(g)(9)’s firearm disabil\n    ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of\n    domestic violence that has as an element the “use . . . of physical\n    force,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase “physical\n    force” only in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony,”\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context\n  of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses. Similarly misplaced is\n  the Government’s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob\n  tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge\n  neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un\n  wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a\n  nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an\n  alien convicted of a “crime of domestic violence,” 8 U. S. C.\n  §1227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,\n  ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9–11.\n     (e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli\n  ance upon the so-called “residual clause” of the definition of “violent\n  felony” in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that “involves\n  conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n  another.” Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera\n  tion whether Johnson’s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a “violent\n  felony” under that provision.

Stat. §784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), “has as an element\nthe use . . . of physical force against the person of an\nother,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a\n“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n§924(e)(1).\n                             I\n  Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing\nammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1).      The Government\nsought an enhanced penalty under §924(e), which provides\nthat a person who violates §922(g) and who “has three\nprevious convictions” for “a violent felony” “committed on\noccasions different from one another” shall be imprisoned\nfor a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A\n“violent felony” is defined as “any crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that:\n    “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    another; or\n    “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other.” §924(e)(2)(B).\n   Johnson’s indictment specified five prior felony convic\ntions. The Government contended that three of those\nconvictions—for aggravated battery and for burglary of a\ndwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003—\nrendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under §924(e)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that\nthe two 1986 convictions were for “violent felon[ies],” but\nhe objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That\nconviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which\nordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.\n§784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant\nwho (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even\nsimple battery) before, §784.03(2).\n   Under §784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person\neither “1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes\nanother person against the will of the other,” or\n“2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.”\nBecause the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the\nprosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.\nState v. Hearns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1107651\"><a href=\"/opinion/1107651/state-v-hearns/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can\nprove that the defendant “[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily\nharm,” that he “intentionally str[uck]” the victim, or that\nhe merely “[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]” the\nvictim.\n   Since nothing in the record of Johnson’s 2003 battery\nconviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it\nrested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural\nity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a\n“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act only\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person\nconstitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning\nof §924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it\ndoes, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under §924(e)(1)\nto a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences\nupon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. §775.084(4)(d)\n(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic\ntions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,”\n§775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to in\nclude a list of enumerated felonies—including murder,\nmanslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated\nassault, and aggravated battery—and also “any other\nfelony which involves the use or threat of physical force or\nviolence against any individual.” §776.08. In Hearns, the\nFlorida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of\nbattery on a law enforcement officer, §784.07(2)(b)—which\nrequires the same conduct (directed against a law en\nforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under\n§784.03(1)(a)—was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at\n219. It said that since §784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only\nthe slightest unwanted physical touch, “the use . . . of\nphysical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at\n219.\n   Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted\nphysical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18\nU. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida\nSupreme Court’s conclusion in Hearns that it does not\nconstitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of\n“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal\nlaw, not state law. And in answering that question we are\n4               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot bound by a state court’s interpretation of a similar—or\neven identical—state statute.\n   We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation of state law, including its determination of\nthe elements of Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). See Johnson v.\nFankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme\nCourt has held that the element of “actually and inten\ntionally touching” under Florida’s battery law is satisfied\nby any intentional physical contact, “no matter how\nslight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal\ncontact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without\nconsent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply\n“th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,”\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in\ndetermining whether a felony conviction for battery under\nFla. Stat. §784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent fel\nony” in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n                              III\n   Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,”\nand we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995).\nThe adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of\nmuch help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted\nby and through concrete bodies—distinguishing physical\nforce from, for example, intellectual force or emotional\nforce. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a\nnumber of meanings. For present purposes we can ex\nclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a\ncause of the acceleration of mass. Webster’s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s\nSecond). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or\nenergy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of\nstrength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical\nrelations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint\nexerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black’s Law Diction\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “force”\nas “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person\nor thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce con\nsisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against\na robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a\ndegree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest\ntouching.\n   There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the\nword “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of\nthe common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the\nintentional application of unlawful force against the per\nson of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive\nCriminal Law §7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);\naccord, Black’s 173. The common law held this element of\n“force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch\ning. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428\n(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, §7.15(a). The\nquestion is whether the term “force” in 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in\nthe common-law definition of battery. The Government\nasserts that it does. We disagree.\n   Although a common-law term of art should be given its\nestablished common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,\n352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu\ntory word is used as a term of art where that meaning\ndoes not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),\nand we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts\nwhere they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,”\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical\nforce” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but\nrather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],”\n§924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we\n6               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence”\nin 18 U. S. C. §16. That provision is very similar to\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense\nwhich “has as an element the use . . . of physical force\nagainst the person or property of another,” §16(a). We\nstated:\n      “In construing both parts of §16, we cannot forget\n    that we ultimately are determining the meaning of\n    the term ‘crime of violence.’ The ordinary meaning of\n    this term, combined with §16’s emphasis on the use of\n    physical force against another person (or the risk of\n    having to use such force in committing a crime), sug\n    gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543\n    U. S., at 11.\n  Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a\nstatutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physi\ncal force” means violent force—that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person. See\nFlores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter\nbrook, J.).     Even by itself, the word “violent” in\n§924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web\nster’s Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting,\nor characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and\nsudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;\nvehement . . .”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.\n1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical\nforce or strength”); Black’s 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or char\nacterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective\n“violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation\nof strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188\n(defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by\nextreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also\nUnited States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)\n(Breyer, C. J.) (“[T]he term to be defined, ‘violent felony,’\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the\npossibility of more closely related, active violence”).\n    It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical\nforce” the Government would seek to import into this\ndefinition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a\ncommon-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery—all\nbattery, and not merely battery by the merest touching—\nwas a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216–\n218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, §2.1(b), at\n90; ALI, Model Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175\n(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5–6 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and\nfelonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple\nbattery—whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury\nvariety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,\ne.g., 2 W.

It is unlikely that\nCongress would select as a term of art defining “violent\nfelony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean\ning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course\n“physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor\nmeaning by artful language, but here the only text that\ncan be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical\nforce” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily\n——————\n  1 The dissent notes, post, at 5–6, that, around the time the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony\noffense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,\nsuch as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether\na conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no\nbearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses—\nmaking unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of\nindividuals—involves the use of “force” within the meaning of\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.\n8                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent\nforce, there is no reason to define “violent felony” by refer\nence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.\n   The Government argues that we cannot construe 18\nU. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as\nan element the use of violent force, because there is no\nmodifier in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of\n“physical force” required. As we have discussed, however,\nthe term “physical force” itself normally connotes force\nstrong enough to constitute “power”—and all the more so\nwhen it is contained in a definition of “violent felony.” Nor\nis there any merit to the dissent’s contention, post, at 4,\nthat the term “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to\nrequire violent force, because Congress specifically named\n“burglary” and “extortion” as “violent felon[ies]” in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can\nbe committed without violence. The point would have\nforce (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have “as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.”\nIn fact, however, they are listed in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as\nexamples of felonies that “presen[t] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.” The Government has not\nargued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies\nunder this latter provision. What the dissent’s argument\ncomes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies\nthat create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as\nviolent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that\ninvolve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of\nphysical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub\nparagraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2\n——————\n   2 Even further afield is the dissent’s argument, post, at 2–3, that since\n\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that “presents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather\nlike saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe\noranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer\nence from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification\nadded to the phrase “physical force” in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\nThat provision forbids the possession of firearms by a\nperson subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the\n“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona\nbly be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence\nof such language in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government\ncontends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a\nmatter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that\n“physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does\nnot suggest that without the qualification “physical force”\nwould consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for\nexample, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict\npain—a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is\nnot a case where Congress has “include[d] particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in\nanother section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States,\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into\nlaw in 1994—eight years after enactment of the language\nin §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103–322, §110401,\n108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99–570, §1402, 100\nStat. 3207–39 (1986).\n                              IV\n  The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its\nability to enforce the firearm disability in §922(g)(9) for\npersons who previously have been convicted of a “misde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to\ninclude certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,”\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have\ninterpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context\n10              JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a statutory definition of “violent felony.” We do not\ndecide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con\ntext of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\nThe issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.\n   In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our\ninterpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur\nsuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n“crime of domestic violence.” That phrase is defined to\nmean “any crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.\n§16])” committed by certain persons, including spouses,\nformer spouses, and parents. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov\nernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal\nbased upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,\ndo not require the use of violent physical force. The dis\nsent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi\nfied, post, at 6–7, and n. 3, as having generic felony\nbattery statutes that cover both violent force and un\nwanted physical contact, our decision will render convic\ntions under those statutes “outside the scope of [the\nArmed Career Criminal Act],” post, at 8.\n   This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.\nWhen the law under which the defendant has been con\nvicted contains statutory phrases that cover several differ\nent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and\nsome of which do not, the “ ‘modified categorical approach’ ”\nthat we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine\nwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by\nconsulting the trial record—including charging docu\nments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,\nand jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990).

Simms, 441 F. 3d 313, 316–317\n(CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v.\nRobledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida\nbattery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); United States\nv. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524–525 (CA7\n2008) (same).\n   It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of\nrecords will often frustrate application of the modified\ncategorical approach—not just to battery but to many\nother crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22–23\n(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common\nenough consequence with respect to the single crime of\nbattery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent\nfelony.”\n                         *     *    *\n   The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh\nCircuit for its consideration of whether Johnson’s 2003\nbattery conviction is a “violent felony” within the meaning\nof the so-called “residual clause” in 18 U.

Moreover, the parties briefed the §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nissue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned\nthat if Johnson’s conviction under Fla.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).\nThe classic definition of the crime of battery is the “inten\ntional application of unlawful force against the person of\nanother.” Ante, at 5 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Sub\nstantive Criminal Law §7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.\n2003); Black’s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed. 2009)). Thus,\nthe crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I\nbelieve that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi\ntional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court\nof Appeals.\n                              I\n  The Court starts out in the right direction by noting\nthat the critical statutory language—“the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person\nof another,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—may mean either\n(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.\nSee ante, at 4–5. The Court veers off course, however, by\nconcluding that the statutory language reaches only vio\nlent force.\n   The term “force,” as the Court correctly notes, had a\nwell-established meaning at common law that included\neven the “slightest offensive touching.” Ante, at 5.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).\nThis approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent\ntouching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be\neven more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient\nto inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap\nin the face).\n   When Congress selects statutory language with a well\nknown common-law meaning, we generally presume that\nCongress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (“We\nrecognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without other\nwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term\nits common-law meaning”); Morissette v. United States,\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Carll, 105 U. S.\n611, 612–613 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest\nthat Congress meant the phrase “use of physical force” in\nACCA to depart from that phrase’s meaning at common\nlaw.\n   On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory\ninterpretation point to the same conclusion. “[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal\nquotation     marks     omitted).         In    18     U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—the clause immediately following the\nclause at issue in this case—the term “violent felony” is\ndefined as including any crime that “involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother.” (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not\ninclude a similar limitation in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should\npresume that it did not intend for such a limitation to\napply.\n   The language used by Congress in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii)\nfurther illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,\namong other things, the possession of a firearm by a per\nson who is subject to a court order that “explicitly prohib\nits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against [an] intimate partner or child that would\nreasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Although §922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until\neight years after §924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former\nprovision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had\nwanted to include in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to\nthose in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress\ncould have easily done so expressly.\n                            II\n  The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret\n18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com\nmon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.\n                             A\n  The Court first argues that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read\nto refer to “violent” force because that provision defines\nthe term “violent felony.” Ante, at 6. But it is apparent\nthat ACCA uses “violent felony” as a term of art with a\nwider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\n4                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and\nextortion are “violent felon[ies],” §924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we\nhave held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted\nburglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is\nnot a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies\ncrimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies\nbecause they often lead to violence. As we have put it,\nthese crimes create “significant risks of . . . confrontation\nthat might result in bodily injury,” id., at 199, and offen\nsive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when\none bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse\nquence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d\n418, 422 (CA5 1996) (“If burglary, with its tendency to\ncause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is\nconsidered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. §16(b), then\nsurely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that\noccurs when a child is sexually molested”); United States\nv. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).\n\n——————\n   1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as “an unlawful or\n\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,\nwith intent to commit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202–203 (attempted\nburglary under Florida law requires “overt conduct directed toward\nunlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to\ncommit a felony therein” and that the “defendant fail in the perpetra\ntion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying\noffense” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not\ndefined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as “the obtain\ning of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use\nof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see also James, supra,\nat 223–224 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (defining extortion in ACCA as “the\nobtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced\nby the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or\nproperty of another” (emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The Court reasons that “[i]t is unlikely\nthat Congress would select as a term of art defining ‘vio\nlent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar\nmeaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.” Ante, at\n7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216–218 (1769), and ALI, Model\nPenal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court\ndoes not spell out why Congress’ selection of this term\nwould be unlikely, but I assume that the Court’s point is\nthat Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a\nviolent felony an offense that was regarded at common law\nas a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the\nsignificance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the\nsubsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita\ntion imposed by 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B).\n   At common law, the terms “felony” and “misdemeanor”\ndid not have the same meaning as they do today. At that\ntime, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);\nmost felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.\nGarner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious\ncrimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to\nmurder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See\nUnited States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439–440 (1976)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm “felony” has come to mean any offense punishable by\na lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one\nyear, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term “misdemeanor” has been reserved for\nminor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors\nat common law have been reclassified as felonies. And\nwhen the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a\nfew States had felony battery statutes that retained the\ncommon-law definition of “force.” See Fla. Stat.\n6                  JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n§784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police\nofficer a felony); Idaho Code §18–915(c) (Lexis 1987)\n(same); Ill. Crim.

Ann. §21–3413(b) (Supp. 1994)\n(simple battery of corrections officers a felony).2\n   ACCA’s mechanism for identifying the battery convic\ntions that merit treatment as “violent felon[ies]” is con\ntained in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), which provides that\nan offense committed by an adult is not a “violent felony”\nunless it is “punishable by imprisonment for a term ex\nceeding one year.” Consequently, while all convictions\nunder battery statutes that track the common-law defini\ntion of the offense satisfy the requirements of\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i)—because they have “as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another”—not all battery convictions\nqualify as convictions for a violent felony because\n§924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not\nregarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being suffi\nciently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more\nthan one year. There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely\nabout this approach.\n                           III\n  The Court’s interpretation will have untoward conse\nquences.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nno doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the\nCourt’s decision will be to take all these convictions out\nside the scope of ACCA—unless the Government is able to\nproduce documents that may properly be consulted under\nthe modified categorical approach and that conclusively\nshow that the offender’s conduct involved the use of vio\nlent force, see ante, at 10–11. As the Government notes,\nhowever, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both\nthe use of violent force and offensive touching, charging\ndocuments frequently simply track the language of the\nstatute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to\ndraw distinctions based on the type of force that the de\nfendant employed. See Brief for United States 42–43.\n   In addition, the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” may hobble at least two federal statutes\nthat contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.\n§922(g)(9), a person convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence” may not lawfully possess a firearm, and\nthe term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” is\ndefined as applying only to crimes that “ha[ve], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.” §921(a)(33)(A) (em\nphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog\nnized that “ ‘many people who engage in serious spousal or\nchild abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of\nfelonies,’ ” and Congress therefore enacted this provision to\nkeep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).\nCases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted\nunder generally applicable assault and battery statutes,\nibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of\nalmost half the States apply both to cases involving the\nuse of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.\nAs a result, if the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” in ACCA is applied to §922(g)(9), a great\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmany persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse\nwill be allowed to possess firearms.\n  Under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n“crime of domestic violence” is subject to removal, and the\nterm “crime of domestic violence” is defined as an offense\nthat, among other things, has “as an element the use [or]\nattempted use . . . of physical force.” 18 U. S. C. §16(a).\nAccordingly, if the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” is applied to this provision, many con\nvicted spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a\nresult that Congress is unlikely to have intended.\n                         *     *    *\n   For all these reasons, I believe that the Court’s decision\nis incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 1732, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/03/02/Johnson_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–6925. Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010\nPetitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a\n  convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The Government sought sen\n  tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an\n  enhanced penalty for a person who violates §922(g) and who “has\n  three previous convictions” for “a violent felony,” §924(e)(1), defined\n  as, inter alia, an offense that “has as an element the use . . . of physi\n  cal force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the\n  three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John\n  son’s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a\n  first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b), but was a felony\n  conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of\n  another battery, Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery\n  occurs when a person either “[a]ctually and intentionally touches or\n  strikes another person against [his] will,” or “[i]ntentionally causes\n  bodily harm to another person.” §784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record\n  permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson’s 2003 convic\n  tion rested upon the “strik[ing]” or “[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily\n  harm” elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a\n  predicate conviction for a “violent felony” under the Armed Career\n  Criminal Act only if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another\n  constitutes the use of “physical force” under §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con\n  cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson’s sentence un\n  der §924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Florida felony offense of battery by “[a]ctually and intention\n ally touch[ing]” another person does not have “as an element the use\n . . . of physical force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n and thus does not constitute a “violent felony” under §924(e)(1).\n2                     JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 3–12.\n       (a) In interpreting the phrase “physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n    the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion in\n    State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218, that, under Florida’s statutory\n    equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. §775.084,\n    the offense of battery does not “involve the use . . . of physical force or\n    violence against any individual,” Fla. Stat. §776.08. The meaning of\n    “physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not\n    state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme\n    Court’s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ\n    ing the Florida Supreme Court’s holding that §784.03(1)(a)’s element\n    of “[a]ctually and intentionally touching” another person is satisfied\n    by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) Because §924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,” the\n    Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,\n    516 U. S. 137, 144–145. The adjective “physical” is clear. The noun\n    “force,” however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning\n    refers to the application of strength, power, and violence—in this con\n    text, against another person. Pp. 4–5.\n       (c) The Government suggests that “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i)’s defi\n    nition of “violent felony” is a legal term of art describing one of the\n    elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that\n    element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al\n    though a common-law term of art should be given its established\n    common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term\n    a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here\n    “physical force” is used in defining not the crime of battery, but\n    rather the statutory category of “violent felony.” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). In\n    that context, “physical force” means violent force—i.e., force capable\n    of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.\n    Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning\n    the Government seeks to impute to the term “force” derives from the\n    elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of\n    §924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that “force” in the definition of a “violent fel\n    ony” should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define\n    the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference\n    about the amount of “force” required by §924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn\n    from §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5–9.\n       (d) There is no force to the Government’s prediction that this deci\n    sion will undermine its ability to enforce §922(g)(9)’s firearm disabil\n    ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of\n    domestic violence that has as an element the “use . . . of physical\n    force,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase “physical\n    force” only in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony,”\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context\n  of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses. Similarly misplaced is\n  the Government’s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob\n  tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge\n  neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un\n  wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a\n  nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an\n  alien convicted of a “crime of domestic violence,” 8 U. S. C.\n  §1227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,\n  ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9–11.\n     (e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli\n  ance upon the so-called “residual clause” of the definition of “violent\n  felony” in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that “involves\n  conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n  another.” Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera\n  tion whether Johnson’s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a “violent\n  felony” under that provision.

Stat. §784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), “has as an element\nthe use . . . of physical force against the person of an\nother,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a\n“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n§924(e)(1).\n                             I\n  Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing\nammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1).      The Government\nsought an enhanced penalty under §924(e), which provides\nthat a person who violates §922(g) and who “has three\nprevious convictions” for “a violent felony” “committed on\noccasions different from one another” shall be imprisoned\nfor a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A\n“violent felony” is defined as “any crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that:\n    “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    another; or\n    “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other.” §924(e)(2)(B).\n   Johnson’s indictment specified five prior felony convic\ntions. The Government contended that three of those\nconvictions—for aggravated battery and for burglary of a\ndwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003—\nrendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under §924(e)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that\nthe two 1986 convictions were for “violent felon[ies],” but\nhe objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That\nconviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which\nordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.\n§784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant\nwho (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even\nsimple battery) before, §784.03(2).\n   Under §784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person\neither “1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes\nanother person against the will of the other,” or\n“2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.”\nBecause the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the\nprosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.\nState v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can\nprove that the defendant “[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily\nharm,” that he “intentionally str[uck]” the victim, or that\nhe merely “[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]” the\nvictim.\n   Since nothing in the record of Johnson’s 2003 battery\nconviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it\nrested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural\nity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a\n“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act only\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person\nconstitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning\nof §924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it\ndoes, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under §924(e)(1)\nto a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences\nupon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. §775.084(4)(d)\n(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic\ntions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,”\n§775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to in\nclude a list of enumerated felonies—including murder,\nmanslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated\nassault, and aggravated battery—and also “any other\nfelony which involves the use or threat of physical force or\nviolence against any individual.” §776.08. In Hearns, the\nFlorida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of\nbattery on a law enforcement officer, §784.07(2)(b)—which\nrequires the same conduct (directed against a law en\nforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under\n§784.03(1)(a)—was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at\n219. It said that since §784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only\nthe slightest unwanted physical touch, “the use . . . of\nphysical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at\n219.\n   Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted\nphysical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18\nU. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida\nSupreme Court’s conclusion in Hearns that it does not\nconstitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of\n“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal\nlaw, not state law. And in answering that question we are\n4               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot bound by a state court’s interpretation of a similar—or\neven identical—state statute.\n   We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s\ninterpretation of state law, including its determination of\nthe elements of Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). See Johnson v.\nFankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme\nCourt has held that the element of “actually and inten\ntionally touching” under Florida’s battery law is satisfied\nby any intentional physical contact, “no matter how\nslight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal\ncontact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without\nconsent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply\n“th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,”\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in\ndetermining whether a felony conviction for battery under\nFla. Stat. §784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent fel\nony” in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n                              III\n   Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,”\nand we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995).\nThe adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of\nmuch help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted\nby and through concrete bodies—distinguishing physical\nforce from, for example, intellectual force or emotional\nforce. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a\nnumber of meanings. For present purposes we can ex\nclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a\ncause of the acceleration of mass. Webster’s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s\nSecond). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or\nenergy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of\nstrength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical\nrelations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint\nexerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black’s Law Diction\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “force”\nas “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person\nor thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce con\nsisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against\na robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a\ndegree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest\ntouching.\n   There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the\nword “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of\nthe common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the\nintentional application of unlawful force against the per\nson of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive\nCriminal Law §7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);\naccord, Black’s 173. The common law held this element of\n“force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch\ning. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.\nCommonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428\n(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, §7.15(a). The\nquestion is whether the term “force” in 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in\nthe common-law definition of battery. The Government\nasserts that it does. We disagree.\n   Although a common-law term of art should be given its\nestablished common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,\n352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu\ntory word is used as a term of art where that meaning\ndoes not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),\nand we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts\nwhere they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,”\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical\nforce” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but\nrather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],”\n§924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we\n6               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence”\nin 18 U. S. C. §16. That provision is very similar to\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense\nwhich “has as an element the use . . . of physical force\nagainst the person or property of another,” §16(a). We\nstated:\n      “In construing both parts of §16, we cannot forget\n    that we ultimately are determining the meaning of\n    the term ‘crime of violence.’ The ordinary meaning of\n    this term, combined with §16’s emphasis on the use of\n    physical force against another person (or the risk of\n    having to use such force in committing a crime), sug\n    gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543\n    U. S., at 11.\n  Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a\nstatutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physi\ncal force” means violent force—that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person. See\nFlores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter\nbrook, J.).     Even by itself, the word “violent” in\n§924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web\nster’s Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting,\nor characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and\nsudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;\nvehement . . .”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.\n1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical\nforce or strength”); Black’s 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or char\nacterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective\n“violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation\nof strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188\n(defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by\nextreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also\nUnited States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)\n(Breyer, C. J.) (“[T]he term to be defined, ‘violent felony,’\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the\npossibility of more closely related, active violence”).\n    It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical\nforce” the Government would seek to import into this\ndefinition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a\ncommon-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery—all\nbattery, and not merely battery by the merest touching—\nwas a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216–\n218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, §2.1(b), at\n90; ALI, Model Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175\n(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5–6 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and\nfelonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple\nbattery—whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury\nvariety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,\ne.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §16.1(b) (2d\ned. 2003 and Supp. 2009–2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§§242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b); Ill.\nComp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/12–3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal\nCode Ann. §22.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that\nCongress would select as a term of art defining “violent\nfelony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean\ning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course\n“physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor\nmeaning by artful language, but here the only text that\ncan be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical\nforce” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily\n——————\n  1 The dissent notes, post, at 5–6, that, around the time the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony\noffense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,\nsuch as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether\na conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no\nbearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses—\nmaking unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of\nindividuals—involves the use of “force” within the meaning of\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.\n8                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent\nforce, there is no reason to define “violent felony” by refer\nence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.\n   The Government argues that we cannot construe 18\nU. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as\nan element the use of violent force, because there is no\nmodifier in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of\n“physical force” required. As we have discussed, however,\nthe term “physical force” itself normally connotes force\nstrong enough to constitute “power”—and all the more so\nwhen it is contained in a definition of “violent felony.” Nor\nis there any merit to the dissent’s contention, post, at 4,\nthat the term “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to\nrequire violent force, because Congress specifically named\n“burglary” and “extortion” as “violent felon[ies]” in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can\nbe committed without violence. The point would have\nforce (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have “as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.”\nIn fact, however, they are listed in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as\nexamples of felonies that “presen[t] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.” The Government has not\nargued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies\nunder this latter provision. What the dissent’s argument\ncomes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies\nthat create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as\nviolent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that\ninvolve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of\nphysical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub\nparagraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2\n——————\n   2 Even further afield is the dissent’s argument, post, at 2–3, that since\n\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that “presents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather\nlike saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe\noranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer\nence from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification\nadded to the phrase “physical force” in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\nThat provision forbids the possession of firearms by a\nperson subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the\n“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona\nbly be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence\nof such language in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government\ncontends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a\nmatter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that\n“physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does\nnot suggest that without the qualification “physical force”\nwould consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for\nexample, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict\npain—a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is\nnot a case where Congress has “include[d] particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in\nanother section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States,\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into\nlaw in 1994—eight years after enactment of the language\nin §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103–322, §110401,\n108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99–570, §1402, 100\nStat. 3207–39 (1986).\n                              IV\n  The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its\nability to enforce the firearm disability in §922(g)(9) for\npersons who previously have been convicted of a “misde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to\ninclude certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,”\n§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have\ninterpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context\n10              JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a statutory definition of “violent felony.” We do not\ndecide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con\ntext of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\nThe issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.\n   In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our\ninterpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur\nsuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n“crime of domestic violence.” That phrase is defined to\nmean “any crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.\n§16])” committed by certain persons, including spouses,\nformer spouses, and parents. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov\nernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal\nbased upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,\ndo not require the use of violent physical force. The dis\nsent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi\nfied, post, at 6–7, and n. 3, as having generic felony\nbattery statutes that cover both violent force and un\nwanted physical contact, our decision will render convic\ntions under those statutes “outside the scope of [the\nArmed Career Criminal Act],” post, at 8.\n   This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.\nWhen the law under which the defendant has been con\nvicted contains statutory phrases that cover several differ\nent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and\nsome of which do not, the “ ‘modified categorical approach’ ”\nthat we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine\nwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by\nconsulting the trial record—including charging docu\nments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,\nand jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990).

Simms, 441 F. 3d 313, 316–317\n(CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v.\nRobledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida\nbattery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); United States\nv. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524–525 (CA7\n2008) (same).\n   It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of\nrecords will often frustrate application of the modified\ncategorical approach—not just to battery but to many\nother crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22–23\n(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common\nenough consequence with respect to the single crime of\nbattery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent\nfelony.”\n                         *     *    *\n   The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh\nCircuit for its consideration of whether Johnson’s 2003\nbattery conviction is a “violent felony” within the meaning\nof the so-called “residual clause” in 18 U.

Moreover, the parties briefed the §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nissue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned\nthat if Johnson’s conviction under Fla.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).\nThe classic definition of the crime of battery is the “inten\ntional application of unlawful force against the person of\nanother.” Ante, at 5 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Sub\nstantive Criminal Law §7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.\n2003); Black’s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed. 2009)). Thus,\nthe crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I\nbelieve that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi\ntional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court\nof Appeals.\n                              I\n  The Court starts out in the right direction by noting\nthat the critical statutory language—“the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person\nof another,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—may mean either\n(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.\nSee ante, at 4–5. The Court veers off course, however, by\nconcluding that the statutory language reaches only vio\nlent force.\n   The term “force,” as the Court correctly notes, had a\nwell-established meaning at common law that included\neven the “slightest offensive touching.” Ante, at 5. See\nalso Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.\nPhila. 1784) (“[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by\na blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet\nthese are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault\nand Battery. . .”); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).\nThis approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent\ntouching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be\neven more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient\nto inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap\nin the face).\n   When Congress selects statutory language with a well\nknown common-law meaning, we generally presume that\nCongress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (“We\nrecognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without other\nwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term\nits common-law meaning”); Morissette v. United States,\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Carll, 105 U. S.\n611, 612–613 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest\nthat Congress meant the phrase “use of physical force” in\nACCA to depart from that phrase’s meaning at common\nlaw.\n   On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory\ninterpretation point to the same conclusion. “[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal\nquotation     marks     omitted).         In    18     U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—the clause immediately following the\nclause at issue in this case—the term “violent felony” is\ndefined as including any crime that “involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother.” (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not\ninclude a similar limitation in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should\npresume that it did not intend for such a limitation to\napply.\n   The language used by Congress in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii)\nfurther illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,\namong other things, the possession of a firearm by a per\nson who is subject to a court order that “explicitly prohib\nits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against [an] intimate partner or child that would\nreasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Although §922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until\neight years after §924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former\nprovision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had\nwanted to include in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to\nthose in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress\ncould have easily done so expressly.\n                            II\n  The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret\n18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com\nmon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.\n                             A\n  The Court first argues that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read\nto refer to “violent” force because that provision defines\nthe term “violent felony.” Ante, at 6. But it is apparent\nthat ACCA uses “violent felony” as a term of art with a\nwider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\n4                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and\nextortion are “violent felon[ies],” §924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we\nhave held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted\nburglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is\nnot a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies\ncrimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies\nbecause they often lead to violence. As we have put it,\nthese crimes create “significant risks of . . . confrontation\nthat might result in bodily injury,” id., at 199, and offen\nsive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when\none bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse\nquence. See United States v.

C. §16(b), then\nsurely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that\noccurs when a child is sexually molested”); United States\nv. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).\n\n——————\n   1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as “an unlawful or\n\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,\nwith intent to commit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202–203 (attempted\nburglary under Florida law requires “overt conduct directed toward\nunlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to\ncommit a felony therein” and that the “defendant fail in the perpetra\ntion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying\noffense” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not\ndefined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as “the obtain\ning of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use\nof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see also James, supra,\nat 223–224 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (defining extortion in ACCA as “the\nobtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced\nby the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or\nproperty of another” (emphasis added)).\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The Court reasons that “[i]t is unlikely\nthat Congress would select as a term of art defining ‘vio\nlent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar\nmeaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.” Ante, at\n7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216–218 (1769), and ALI, Model\nPenal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court\ndoes not spell out why Congress’ selection of this term\nwould be unlikely, but I assume that the Court’s point is\nthat Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a\nviolent felony an offense that was regarded at common law\nas a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the\nsignificance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the\nsubsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita\ntion imposed by 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B).\n   At common law, the terms “felony” and “misdemeanor”\ndid not have the same meaning as they do today. At that\ntime, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);\nmost felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.\nGarner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious\ncrimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to\nmurder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See\nUnited States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439–440 (1976)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm “felony” has come to mean any offense punishable by\na lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one\nyear, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term “misdemeanor” has been reserved for\nminor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors\nat common law have been reclassified as felonies. And\nwhen the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a\nfew States had felony battery statutes that retained the\ncommon-law definition of “force.” See Fla. Stat.\n6                  JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n§784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police\nofficer a felony); Idaho Code §18–915(c) (Lexis 1987)\n(same); Ill. Crim. Code §12–4(b)(6) (1988) (same); La. Stat.\nAnn. §§14:33, 14:43.1 (West 1986) (sexual battery punish\nable by more than one year’s imprisonment); N. M. Stat.\nAnn. §40A–22–23 (1972) (battery of a police officer a fel\nony); see also Kansas Stat. Ann. §21–3413(b) (Supp. 1994)\n(simple battery of corrections officers a felony).2\n   ACCA’s mechanism for identifying the battery convic\ntions that merit treatment as “violent felon[ies]” is con\ntained in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), which provides that\nan offense committed by an adult is not a “violent felony”\nunless it is “punishable by imprisonment for a term ex\nceeding one year.” Consequently, while all convictions\nunder battery statutes that track the common-law defini\ntion of the offense satisfy the requirements of\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i)—because they have “as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another”—not all battery convictions\nqualify as convictions for a violent felony because\n§924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not\nregarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being suffi\nciently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more\nthan one year. There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely\nabout this approach.\n                           III\n  The Court’s interpretation will have untoward conse\nquences. Almost half of the States have statutes that\nreach both the use of violent force and force that is not\n\n——————\n   2 These state statutes show that Congress, by using a term of art,\n\n“force,” did not adopt a meaning “peculiar . . .

UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nno doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the\nCourt’s decision will be to take all these convictions out\nside the scope of ACCA—unless the Government is able to\nproduce documents that may properly be consulted under\nthe modified categorical approach and that conclusively\nshow that the offender’s conduct involved the use of vio\nlent force, see ante, at 10–11. As the Government notes,\nhowever, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both\nthe use of violent force and offensive touching, charging\ndocuments frequently simply track the language of the\nstatute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to\ndraw distinctions based on the type of force that the de\nfendant employed. See Brief for United States 42–43.\n   In addition, the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” may hobble at least two federal statutes\nthat contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.\n§922(g)(9), a person convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence” may not lawfully possess a firearm, and\nthe term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” is\ndefined as applying only to crimes that “ha[ve], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.” §921(a)(33)(A) (em\nphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog\nnized that “ ‘many people who engage in serious spousal or\nchild abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of\nfelonies,’ ” and Congress therefore enacted this provision to\nkeep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).\nCases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted\nunder generally applicable assault and battery statutes,\nibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of\nalmost half the States apply both to cases involving the\nuse of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.\nAs a result, if the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” in ACCA is applied to §922(g)(9), a great\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n“crime of domestic violence” is subject to removal, and the\nterm “crime of domestic violence” is defined as an offense\nthat, among other things, has “as an element the use [or]\nattempted use . . . of physical force.” 18 U. S. C. §16(a).\nAccordingly, if the Court’s interpretation of the term\n“physical force” is applied to this provision, many con\nvicted spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a\nresult that Congress is unlikely to have intended.\n                         *     *    *\n   For all these reasons, I believe that the Court’s decision\nis incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1732/", "sha1": "a453fa11f3a0b7d57e347700ea1eda52ccd04dea", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-029", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:09"}
