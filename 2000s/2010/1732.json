UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08\u20136925. Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nPetitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a\n  convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). The Government sought sen\n  tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an\n  enhanced penalty for a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas\n  three previous convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1), defined\n  as, inter alia, an offense that \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physi\n  cal force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the\n  three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John\n  son\u2019s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a\n  first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b), but was a felony\n  conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of\n  another battery, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery\n  occurs when a person either \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touches or\n  strikes another person against [his] will,\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally causes\n  bodily harm to another person.\u201d \u00a7784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record\n  permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson\u2019s 2003 convic\n  tion rested upon the \u201cstrik[ing]\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily\n  harm\u201d elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a\n  predicate conviction for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career\n  Criminal Act only if \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another\n  constitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con\n  cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson\u2019s sentence un\n  der \u00a7924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Florida felony offense of battery by \u201c[a]ctually and intention\n ally touch[ing]\u201d another person does not have \u201cas an element the use\n . . . of physical force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n and thus does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(1).\n2                     JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 3\u201312.\n       (a) In interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n    the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in\n    State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218, that, under Florida\u2019s statutory\n    equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7775.084,\n    the offense of battery does not \u201cinvolve the use . . . of physical force or\n    violence against any individual,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7776.08. The meaning of\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not\n    state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme\n    Court\u2019s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ\n    ing the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2019s element\n    of \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touching\u201d another person is satisfied\n    by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (b) Because \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d the\n    Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,\n    516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145. The adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear. The noun\n    \u201cforce,\u201d however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning\n    refers to the application of strength, power, and violence\u2014in this con\n    text, against another person. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (c) The Government suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s defi\n    nition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a legal term of art describing one of the\n    elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that\n    element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al\n    though a common-law term of art should be given its established\n    common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term\n    a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d is used in defining not the crime of battery, but\n    rather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). In\n    that context, \u201cphysical force\u201d means violent force\u2014i.e., force capable\n    of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.\n    Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning\n    the Government seeks to impute to the term \u201cforce\u201d derives from the\n    elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of\n    \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in the definition of a \u201cviolent fel\n    ony\u201d should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define\n    the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference\n    about the amount of \u201cforce\u201d required by \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn\n    from \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (d) There is no force to the Government\u2019s prediction that this deci\n    sion will undermine its ability to enforce \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm disabil\n    ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of\n    domestic violence that has as an element the \u201cuse . . . of physical\n    force,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase \u201cphysical\n    force\u201d only in the context of a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context\n  of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses. Similarly misplaced is\n  the Government\u2019s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob\n  tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge\n  neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un\n  wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a\n  nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an\n  alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,\n  ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli\n  ance upon the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the definition of \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that \u201cinvolves\n  conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n  another.\u201d Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera\n  tion whether Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d under that provision. Pp. 11\u201312.\n528 F. 3d 1318, reversed and remanded.\n\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \u201chas as an element\nthe use . . . of physical force against the person of an\nother,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n\u00a7924(e)(1).\n                             I\n  Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing\nammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1).      The Government\nsought an enhanced penalty under \u00a7924(e), which provides\nthat a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas three\nprevious convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony\u201d \u201ccommitted on\noccasions different from one another\u201d shall be imprisoned\nfor a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that:\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   Johnson\u2019s indictment specified five prior felony convic\ntions. The Government contended that three of those\nconvictions\u2014for aggravated battery and for burglary of a\ndwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003\u2014\nrendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under \u00a7924(e)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that\nthe two 1986 convictions were for \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d but\nhe objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That\nconviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which\nordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant\nwho (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even\nsimple battery) before, \u00a7784.03(2).\n   Under \u00a7784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person\neither \u201c1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes\nanother person against the will of the other,\u201d or\n\u201c2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d\nBecause the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the\nprosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.\nState v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can\nprove that the defendant \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily\nharm,\u201d that he \u201cintentionally str[uck]\u201d the victim, or that\nhe merely \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]\u201d the\nvictim.\n   Since nothing in the record of Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery\nconviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it\nrested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural\nity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another person\nconstitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d within the meaning\nof \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it\ndoes, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under \u00a7924(e)(1)\nto a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences\nupon \u201cviolent career criminal[s],\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7775.084(4)(d)\n(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic\ntions for certain felonies, including any \u201cforcible felony,\u201d\n\u00a7775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). \u201c[F]orcible felony\u201d is defined to in\nclude a list of enumerated felonies\u2014including murder,\nmanslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated\nassault, and aggravated battery\u2014and also \u201cany other\nfelony which involves the use or threat of physical force or\nviolence against any individual.\u201d \u00a7776.08. In Hearns, the\nFlorida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of\nbattery on a law enforcement officer, \u00a7784.07(2)(b)\u2014which\nrequires the same conduct (directed against a law en\nforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under\n\u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2014was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at\n219. It said that since \u00a7784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only\nthe slightest unwanted physical touch, \u201cthe use . . . of\nphysical force\u201d was not an element of the offense. Id., at\n219.\n   Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted\nphysical touching constitutes \u201cphysical force\u201d under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s conclusion in Hearns that it does not\nconstitute \u201cphysical force.\u201d That is not so. The meaning of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal\nlaw, not state law. And in answering that question we are\n4               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of a similar\u2014or\neven identical\u2014state statute.\n   We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of state law, including its determination of\nthe elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). See Johnson v.\nFankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme\nCourt has held that the element of \u201cactually and inten\ntionally touching\u201d under Florida\u2019s battery law is satisfied\nby any intentional physical contact, \u201cno matter how\nslight.\u201d Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most \u201cnominal\ncontact,\u201d such as a \u201cta[p] . . . on the shoulder without\nconsent,\u201d id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply\n\u201cth[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,\u201d\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in\ndetermining whether a felony conviction for battery under\nFla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2) meets the definition of \u201cviolent fel\nony\u201d in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n                              III\n   Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d\nand we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145 (1995).\nThe adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear in meaning but not of\nmuch help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted\nby and through concrete bodies\u2014distinguishing physical\nforce from, for example, intellectual force or emotional\nforce. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; \u201cforce\u201d has a\nnumber of meanings. For present purposes we can ex\nclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a\ncause of the acceleration of mass. Webster\u2019s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s\nSecond). In more general usage it means \u201c[s]trength or\nenergy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of\nstrength or energy,\u201d \u201c[p]ower to affect strongly in physical\nrelations,\u201d or \u201c[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint\nexerted upon a person.\u201d Id., at 985.

All of these definitions suggest a\ndegree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest\ntouching.\n   There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the\nword \u201cforce\u201d: its use in describing one of the elements of\nthe common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the\nintentional application of unlawful force against the per\nson of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive\nCriminal Law \u00a77.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);\naccord, Black\u2019s 173. The common law held this element of\n\u201cforce\u201d to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch\ning. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.\nCommonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428\n(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a77.15(a). The\nquestion is whether the term \u201cforce\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in\nthe common-law definition of battery. The Government\nasserts that it does. We disagree.\n   Although a common-law term of art should be given its\nestablished common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,\n352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu\ntory word is used as a term of art where that meaning\ndoes not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),\nand we \u201cdo not force term-of-art definitions into contexts\nwhere they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,\u201d\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d as used in defining not the crime of battery, but\nrather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we\n6               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreted the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nin 18 U. S. C. \u00a716. That provision is very similar to\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense\nwhich \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force\nagainst the person or property of another,\u201d \u00a716(a). We\nstated:\n      \u201cIn construing both parts of \u00a716, we cannot forget\n    that we ultimately are determining the meaning of\n    the term \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 The ordinary meaning of\n    this term, combined with \u00a716\u2019s emphasis on the use of\n    physical force against another person (or the risk of\n    having to use such force in committing a crime), sug\n    gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .\u201d 543\n    U. S., at 11.\n  Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a\nstatutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the phrase \u201cphysi\ncal force\u201d means violent force\u2014that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person. See\nFlores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter\nbrook, J.).     Even by itself, the word \u201cviolent\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web\nster\u2019s Second 2846 (defining \u201cviolent\u201d as \u201c[m]oving, acting,\nor characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and\nsudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;\nvehement . . .\u201d); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.\n1989) (\u201c[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical\nforce or strength\u201d); Black\u2019s 1706 (\u201c[o]f, relating to, or char\nacterized by strong physical force\u201d). When the adjective\n\u201cviolent\u201d is attached to the noun \u201cfelony,\u201d its connotation\nof strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188\n(defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201c[a] crime characterized by\nextreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon\u201d); see also\nUnited States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)\n(Breyer, C. J.) (\u201c[T]he term to be defined, \u2018violent felony,\u2019\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

At common law, battery\u2014all\nbattery, and not merely battery by the merest touching\u2014\nwas a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216\u2013\n218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a72.1(b), at\n90; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175\n(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5\u20136 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and\nfelonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple\nbattery\u2014whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury\nvariety\u2014generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,\ne.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a716.1(b) (2d\ned. 2003 and Supp. 2009\u20132010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b); Ill.\nComp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/12\u20133(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a722.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that\nCongress would select as a term of art defining \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean\ning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course\n\u201cphysical force\u201d can be given its common-law misdemeanor\nmeaning by artful language, but here the only text that\ncan be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The dissent notes, post, at 5\u20136, that, around the time the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act became law, in \u201cquite a few States\u201d it was a felony\noffense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,\nsuch as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether\na conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a \u201cfelony\u201d conviction. But it has no\nbearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses\u2014\nmaking unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of\nindividuals\u2014involves the use of \u201cforce\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.\n8                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent\nforce, there is no reason to define \u201cviolent felony\u201d by refer\nence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.\n   The Government argues that we cannot construe 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as\nan element the use of violent force, because there is no\nmodifier in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d required. As we have discussed, however,\nthe term \u201cphysical force\u201d itself normally connotes force\nstrong enough to constitute \u201cpower\u201d\u2014and all the more so\nwhen it is contained in a definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Nor\nis there any merit to the dissent\u2019s contention, post, at 4,\nthat the term \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to\nrequire violent force, because Congress specifically named\n\u201cburglary\u201d and \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can\nbe committed without violence. The point would have\nforce (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have \u201cas an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d\nIn fact, however, they are listed in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as\nexamples of felonies that \u201cpresen[t] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.\u201d The Government has not\nargued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies\nunder this latter provision. What the dissent\u2019s argument\ncomes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies\nthat create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as\nviolent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that\ninvolve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of\nphysical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub\nparagraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Even further afield is the dissent\u2019s argument, post, at 2\u20133, that since\n\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather\nlike saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe\noranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer\nence from the presence of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d specification\nadded to the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\nThat provision forbids the possession of firearms by a\nperson subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the\n\u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona\nbly be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d Ibid. The absence\nof such language in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government\ncontends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a\nmatter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that\n\u201cphysical force\u201d must rise to the level of bodily injury does\nnot suggest that without the qualification \u201cphysical force\u201d\nwould consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for\nexample, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict\npain\u2014a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is\nnot a case where Congress has \u201cinclude[d] particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in\nanother section of the same Act,\u201d Russello v. United States,\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into\nlaw in 1994\u2014eight years after enactment of the language\nin \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103\u2013322, \u00a7110401,\n108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99\u2013570, \u00a71402, 100\nStat. 3207\u201339 (1986).\n                              IV\n  The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its\nability to enforce the firearm disability in \u00a7922(g)(9) for\npersons who previously have been convicted of a \u201cmisde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d which is defined to\ninclude certain misdemeanor offenses that have, \u201cas an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have\ninterpreted the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d only in the context\n10              JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d We do not\ndecide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con\ntext of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\nThe issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.\n   In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our\ninterpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur\nsuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d That phrase is defined to\nmean \u201cany crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.\n\u00a716])\u201d committed by certain persons, including spouses,\nformer spouses, and parents. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov\nernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal\nbased upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,\ndo not require the use of violent physical force. The dis\nsent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi\nfied, post, at 6\u20137, and n. 3, as having generic felony\nbattery statutes that cover both violent force and un\nwanted physical contact, our decision will render convic\ntions under those statutes \u201coutside the scope of [the\nArmed Career Criminal Act],\u201d post, at 8.\n   This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.\nWhen the law under which the defendant has been con\nvicted contains statutory phrases that cover several differ\nent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and\nsome of which do not, the \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019 \u201d\nthat we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine\nwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by\nconsulting the trial record\u2014including charging docu\nments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,\nand jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990).

Simms, 441 F. 3d 313, 316\u2013317\n(CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v.\nRobledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida\nbattery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); United States\nv. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524\u2013525 (CA7\n2008) (same).\n   It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of\nrecords will often frustrate application of the modified\ncategorical approach\u2014not just to battery but to many\nother crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22\u201323\n(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common\nenough consequence with respect to the single crime of\nbattery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term \u201cviolent\nfelony.\u201d\n                         *     *    *\n   The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh\nCircuit for its consideration of whether Johnson\u2019s 2003\nbattery conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning\nof the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We decline to do so. The Government\ndid not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at\nsentencing any reliance upon the residual clause. App.\n44\u201345. Moreover, the parties briefed the \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nissue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned\nthat if Johnson\u2019s conviction under Fla.

Thus,\nthe crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I\nbelieve that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi\ntional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court\nof Appeals.\n                              I\n  The Court starts out in the right direction by noting\nthat the critical statutory language\u2014\u201cthe use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person\nof another,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014may mean either\n(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.\nSee ante, at 4\u20135. The Court veers off course, however, by\nconcluding that the statutory language reaches only vio\nlent force.\n   The term \u201cforce,\u201d as the Court correctly notes, had a\nwell-established meaning at common law that included\neven the \u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201d Ante, at 5. See\nalso Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.\nPhila. 1784) (\u201c[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by\na blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet\nthese are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault\nand Battery. . .\u201d); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).\nThis approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent\ntouching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be\neven more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient\nto inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap\nin the face).\n   When Congress selects statutory language with a well\nknown common-law meaning, we generally presume that\nCongress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (\u201cWe\nrecognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without other\nwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term\nits common-law meaning\u201d); Morissette v.

And here, I see nothing to suggest\nthat Congress meant the phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d in\nACCA to depart from that phrase\u2019s meaning at common\nlaw.\n   On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory\ninterpretation point to the same conclusion. \u201c[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. \u201d\nRussello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal\nquotation     marks     omitted).         In    18     U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014the clause immediately following the\nclause at issue in this case\u2014the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is\ndefined as including any crime that \u201cinvolves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not\ninclude a similar limitation in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should\npresume that it did not intend for such a limitation to\napply.\n   The language used by Congress in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii)\nfurther illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,\namong other things, the possession of a firearm by a per\nson who is subject to a court order that \u201cexplicitly prohib\nits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against [an] intimate partner or child that would\nreasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Although \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until\neight years after \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former\nprovision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had\nwanted to include in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to\nthose in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress\ncould have easily done so expressly.\n                            II\n  The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com\nmon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.\n                             A\n  The Court first argues that \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read\nto refer to \u201cviolent\u201d force because that provision defines\nthe term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Ante, at 6. But it is apparent\nthat ACCA uses \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a term of art with a\nwider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\n4                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and\nextortion are \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we\nhave held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted\nburglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is\nnot a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies\ncrimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies\nbecause they often lead to violence. As we have put it,\nthese crimes create \u201csignificant risks of . . . confrontation\nthat might result in bodily injury,\u201d id., at 199, and offen\nsive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when\none bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse\nquence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d\n418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\u201cIf burglary, with its tendency to\ncause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is\nconsidered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(b), then\nsurely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that\noccurs when a child is sexually molested\u201d); United States\nv. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as \u201can unlawful or\n\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,\nwith intent to commit a crime.\u201d Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202\u2013203 (attempted\nburglary under Florida law requires \u201covert conduct directed toward\nunlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to\ncommit a felony therein\u201d and that the \u201cdefendant fail in the perpetra\ntion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying\noffense\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not\ndefined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as \u201cthe obtain\ning of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use\nof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d 18 U.

The Court reasons that \u201c[i]t is unlikely\nthat Congress would select as a term of art defining \u2018vio\nlent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar\nmeaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.\u201d Ante, at\n7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216\u2013218 (1769), and ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court\ndoes not spell out why Congress\u2019 selection of this term\nwould be unlikely, but I assume that the Court\u2019s point is\nthat Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a\nviolent felony an offense that was regarded at common law\nas a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the\nsignificance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the\nsubsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita\ntion imposed by 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   At common law, the terms \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d\ndid not have the same meaning as they do today. At that\ntime, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);\nmost felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.\nGarner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious\ncrimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to\nmurder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See\nUnited States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439\u2013440 (1976)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm \u201cfelony\u201d has come to mean any offense punishable by\na lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one\nyear, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d has been reserved for\nminor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors\nat common law have been reclassified as felonies. And\nwhen the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a\nfew States had felony battery statutes that retained the\ncommon-law definition of \u201cforce.\u201d See Fla. Stat.\n6                  JOHNSON v.

As the Government notes,\nhowever, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both\nthe use of violent force and offensive touching, charging\ndocuments frequently simply track the language of the\nstatute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to\ndraw distinctions based on the type of force that the de\nfendant employed. See Brief for United States 42\u201343.\n   In addition, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d may hobble at least two federal statutes\nthat contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and\nthe term \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is\ndefined as applying only to crimes that \u201cha[ve], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (em\nphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog\nnized that \u201c \u2018many people who engage in serious spousal or\nchild abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of\nfelonies,\u2019 \u201d and Congress therefore enacted this provision to\nkeep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).\nCases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted\nunder generally applicable assault and battery statutes,\nibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of\nalmost half the States apply both to cases involving the\nuse of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.\nAs a result, if the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d in ACCA is applied to \u00a7922(g)(9), a great\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nPetitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a\n  convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). The Government sought sen\n  tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an\n  enhanced penalty for a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas\n  three previous convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1), defined\n  as, inter alia, an offense that \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physi\n  cal force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the\n  three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John\n  son\u2019s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a\n  first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b), but was a felony\n  conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of\n  another battery, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery\n  occurs when a person either \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touches or\n  strikes another person against [his] will,\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally causes\n  bodily harm to another person.\u201d \u00a7784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record\n  permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson\u2019s 2003 convic\n  tion rested upon the \u201cstrik[ing]\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily\n  harm\u201d elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a\n  predicate conviction for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career\n  Criminal Act only if \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another\n  constitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con\n  cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson\u2019s sentence un\n  der \u00a7924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Florida felony offense of battery by \u201c[a]ctually and intention\n ally touch[ing]\u201d another person does not have \u201cas an element the use\n . . . of physical force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n and thus does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(1).\n2                     JOHNSON v.

The meaning of\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not\n    state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme\n    Court\u2019s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ\n    ing the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2019s element\n    of \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touching\u201d another person is satisfied\n    by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (b) Because \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d the\n    Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,\n    516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145. The adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear. The noun\n    \u201cforce,\u201d however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning\n    refers to the application of strength, power, and violence\u2014in this con\n    text, against another person. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (c) The Government suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s defi\n    nition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a legal term of art describing one of the\n    elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that\n    element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al\n    though a common-law term of art should be given its established\n    common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term\n    a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d is used in defining not the crime of battery, but\n    rather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). In\n    that context, \u201cphysical force\u201d means violent force\u2014i.e., force capable\n    of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.\n    Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning\n    the Government seeks to impute to the term \u201cforce\u201d derives from the\n    elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of\n    \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in the definition of a \u201cviolent fel\n    ony\u201d should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define\n    the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference\n    about the amount of \u201cforce\u201d required by \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn\n    from \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (d) There is no force to the Government\u2019s prediction that this deci\n    sion will undermine its ability to enforce \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm disabil\n    ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of\n    domestic violence that has as an element the \u201cuse . . . of physical\n    force,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase \u201cphysical\n    force\u201d only in the context of a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Similarly misplaced is\n  the Government\u2019s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob\n  tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge\n  neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un\n  wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a\n  nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an\n  alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,\n  ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli\n  ance upon the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the definition of \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that \u201cinvolves\n  conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n  another.\u201d Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera\n  tion whether Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d under that provision.

Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \u201chas as an element\nthe use . . . of physical force against the person of an\nother,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n\u00a7924(e)(1).\n                             I\n  Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing\nammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1).      The Government\nsought an enhanced penalty under \u00a7924(e), which provides\nthat a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas three\nprevious convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony\u201d \u201ccommitted on\noccasions different from one another\u201d shall be imprisoned\nfor a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that:\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   Johnson\u2019s indictment specified five prior felony convic\ntions. The Government contended that three of those\nconvictions\u2014for aggravated battery and for burglary of a\ndwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003\u2014\nrendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under \u00a7924(e)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that\nthe two 1986 convictions were for \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d but\nhe objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That\nconviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which\nordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant\nwho (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even\nsimple battery) before, \u00a7784.03(2).\n   Under \u00a7784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person\neither \u201c1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes\nanother person against the will of the other,\u201d or\n\u201c2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d\nBecause the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the\nprosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.\nState v. Hearns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1107651\"><a href=\"/opinion/1107651/state-v-hearns/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can\nprove that the defendant \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily\nharm,\u201d that he \u201cintentionally str[uck]\u201d the victim, or that\nhe merely \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]\u201d the\nvictim.\n   Since nothing in the record of Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery\nconviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it\nrested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural\nity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another person\nconstitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d within the meaning\nof \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it\ndoes, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under \u00a7924(e)(1)\nto a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences\nupon \u201cviolent career criminal[s],\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7775.084(4)(d)\n(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic\ntions for certain felonies, including any \u201cforcible felony,\u201d\n\u00a7775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). \u201c[F]orcible felony\u201d is defined to in\nclude a list of enumerated felonies\u2014including murder,\nmanslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated\nassault, and aggravated battery\u2014and also \u201cany other\nfelony which involves the use or threat of physical force or\nviolence against any individual.\u201d \u00a7776.08. In Hearns, the\nFlorida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of\nbattery on a law enforcement officer, \u00a7784.07(2)(b)\u2014which\nrequires the same conduct (directed against a law en\nforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under\n\u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2014was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at\n219. It said that since \u00a7784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only\nthe slightest unwanted physical touch, \u201cthe use . . . of\nphysical force\u201d was not an element of the offense. Id., at\n219.\n   Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted\nphysical touching constitutes \u201cphysical force\u201d under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s conclusion in Hearns that it does not\nconstitute \u201cphysical force.\u201d That is not so. The meaning of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal\nlaw, not state law. And in answering that question we are\n4               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of a similar\u2014or\neven identical\u2014state statute.\n   We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of state law, including its determination of\nthe elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). See Johnson v.\nFankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme\nCourt has held that the element of \u201cactually and inten\ntionally touching\u201d under Florida\u2019s battery law is satisfied\nby any intentional physical contact, \u201cno matter how\nslight.\u201d Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most \u201cnominal\ncontact,\u201d such as a \u201cta[p] . . . on the shoulder without\nconsent,\u201d id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply\n\u201cth[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,\u201d\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in\ndetermining whether a felony conviction for battery under\nFla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2) meets the definition of \u201cviolent fel\nony\u201d in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n                              III\n   Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d\nand we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145 (1995).\nThe adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear in meaning but not of\nmuch help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted\nby and through concrete bodies\u2014distinguishing physical\nforce from, for example, intellectual force or emotional\nforce. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; \u201cforce\u201d has a\nnumber of meanings. For present purposes we can ex\nclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a\ncause of the acceleration of mass. Webster\u2019s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s\nSecond). In more general usage it means \u201c[s]trength or\nenergy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of\nstrength or energy,\u201d \u201c[p]ower to affect strongly in physical\nrelations,\u201d or \u201c[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint\nexerted upon a person.\u201d Id., at 985.

All of these definitions suggest a\ndegree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest\ntouching.\n   There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the\nword \u201cforce\u201d: its use in describing one of the elements of\nthe common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the\nintentional application of unlawful force against the per\nson of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive\nCriminal Law \u00a77.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);\naccord, Black\u2019s 173. The common law held this element of\n\u201cforce\u201d to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch\ning. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428\n(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a77.15(a). The\nquestion is whether the term \u201cforce\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in\nthe common-law definition of battery. The Government\nasserts that it does. We disagree.\n   Although a common-law term of art should be given its\nestablished common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,\n352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu\ntory word is used as a term of art where that meaning\ndoes not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),\nand we \u201cdo not force term-of-art definitions into contexts\nwhere they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,\u201d\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d as used in defining not the crime of battery, but\nrather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we\n6               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreted the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nin 18 U. S. C. \u00a716. That provision is very similar to\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense\nwhich \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force\nagainst the person or property of another,\u201d \u00a716(a). We\nstated:\n      \u201cIn construing both parts of \u00a716, we cannot forget\n    that we ultimately are determining the meaning of\n    the term \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 The ordinary meaning of\n    this term, combined with \u00a716\u2019s emphasis on the use of\n    physical force against another person (or the risk of\n    having to use such force in committing a crime), sug\n    gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .\u201d 543\n    U. S., at 11.\n  Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a\nstatutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the phrase \u201cphysi\ncal force\u201d means violent force\u2014that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person. See\nFlores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter\nbrook, J.).     Even by itself, the word \u201cviolent\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web\nster\u2019s Second 2846 (defining \u201cviolent\u201d as \u201c[m]oving, acting,\nor characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and\nsudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;\nvehement . . .\u201d); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.\n1989) (\u201c[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical\nforce or strength\u201d); Black\u2019s 1706 (\u201c[o]f, relating to, or char\nacterized by strong physical force\u201d). When the adjective\n\u201cviolent\u201d is attached to the noun \u201cfelony,\u201d its connotation\nof strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188\n(defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201c[a] crime characterized by\nextreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon\u201d); see also\nUnited States v.

At common law, battery\u2014all\nbattery, and not merely battery by the merest touching\u2014\nwas a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216\u2013\n218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a72.1(b), at\n90; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175\n(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5\u20136 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and\nfelonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple\nbattery\u2014whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury\nvariety\u2014generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,\ne.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a716.1(b) (2d\ned. 2003 and Supp. 2009\u20132010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b); Ill.\nComp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/12\u20133(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a722.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that\nCongress would select as a term of art defining \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean\ning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course\n\u201cphysical force\u201d can be given its common-law misdemeanor\nmeaning by artful language, but here the only text that\ncan be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The dissent notes, post, at 5\u20136, that, around the time the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act became law, in \u201cquite a few States\u201d it was a felony\noffense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,\nsuch as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether\na conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a \u201cfelony\u201d conviction. But it has no\nbearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses\u2014\nmaking unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of\nindividuals\u2014involves the use of \u201cforce\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.\n8                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent\nforce, there is no reason to define \u201cviolent felony\u201d by refer\nence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.\n   The Government argues that we cannot construe 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as\nan element the use of violent force, because there is no\nmodifier in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d required. As we have discussed, however,\nthe term \u201cphysical force\u201d itself normally connotes force\nstrong enough to constitute \u201cpower\u201d\u2014and all the more so\nwhen it is contained in a definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Nor\nis there any merit to the dissent\u2019s contention, post, at 4,\nthat the term \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to\nrequire violent force, because Congress specifically named\n\u201cburglary\u201d and \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can\nbe committed without violence. The point would have\nforce (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have \u201cas an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d\nIn fact, however, they are listed in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as\nexamples of felonies that \u201cpresen[t] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.\u201d The Government has not\nargued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies\nunder this latter provision. What the dissent\u2019s argument\ncomes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies\nthat create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as\nviolent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that\ninvolve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of\nphysical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub\nparagraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Even further afield is the dissent\u2019s argument, post, at 2\u20133, that since\n\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather\nlike saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe\noranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer\nence from the presence of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d specification\nadded to the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\nThat provision forbids the possession of firearms by a\nperson subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the\n\u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona\nbly be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d Ibid. The absence\nof such language in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government\ncontends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a\nmatter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that\n\u201cphysical force\u201d must rise to the level of bodily injury does\nnot suggest that without the qualification \u201cphysical force\u201d\nwould consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for\nexample, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict\npain\u2014a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is\nnot a case where Congress has \u201cinclude[d] particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in\nanother section of the same Act,\u201d Russello v. United States,\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into\nlaw in 1994\u2014eight years after enactment of the language\nin \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103\u2013322, \u00a7110401,\n108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub.

The prediction is unfounded. We have\ninterpreted the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d only in the context\n10              JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d We do not\ndecide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con\ntext of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\nThe issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.\n   In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our\ninterpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur\nsuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d That phrase is defined to\nmean \u201cany crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.\n\u00a716])\u201d committed by certain persons, including spouses,\nformer spouses, and parents. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov\nernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal\nbased upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,\ndo not require the use of violent physical force. The dis\nsent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi\nfied, post, at 6\u20137, and n. 3, as having generic felony\nbattery statutes that cover both violent force and un\nwanted physical contact, our decision will render convic\ntions under those statutes \u201coutside the scope of [the\nArmed Career Criminal Act],\u201d post, at 8.\n   This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.\nWhen the law under which the defendant has been con\nvicted contains statutory phrases that cover several differ\nent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and\nsome of which do not, the \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019 \u201d\nthat we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine\nwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by\nconsulting the trial record\u2014including charging docu\nments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,\nand jury instructions and verdict forms.

Appx. 521, 524\u2013525 (CA7\n2008) (same).\n   It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of\nrecords will often frustrate application of the modified\ncategorical approach\u2014not just to battery but to many\nother crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22\u201323\n(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common\nenough consequence with respect to the single crime of\nbattery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term \u201cviolent\nfelony.\u201d\n                         *     *    *\n   The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh\nCircuit for its consideration of whether Johnson\u2019s 2003\nbattery conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning\nof the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in 18 U.

Thus,\nthe crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).\nThis approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent\ntouching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be\neven more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient\nto inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap\nin the face).\n   When Congress selects statutory language with a well\nknown common-law meaning, we generally presume that\nCongress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (\u201cWe\nrecognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without other\nwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term\nits common-law meaning\u201d); Morissette v.

And here, I see nothing to suggest\nthat Congress meant the phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d in\nACCA to depart from that phrase\u2019s meaning at common\nlaw.\n   On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory\ninterpretation point to the same conclusion. \u201c[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014the clause immediately following the\nclause at issue in this case\u2014the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is\ndefined as including any crime that \u201cinvolves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not\ninclude a similar limitation in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should\npresume that it did not intend for such a limitation to\napply.\n   The language used by Congress in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii)\nfurther illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,\namong other things, the possession of a firearm by a per\nson who is subject to a court order that \u201cexplicitly prohib\nits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against [an] intimate partner or child that would\nreasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Although \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until\neight years after \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former\nprovision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had\nwanted to include in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to\nthose in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress\ncould have easily done so expressly.\n                            II\n  The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com\nmon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.\n                             A\n  The Court first argues that \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read\nto refer to \u201cviolent\u201d force because that provision defines\nthe term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Ante, at 6. But it is apparent\nthat ACCA uses \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a term of art with a\nwider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\n4                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and\nextortion are \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we\nhave held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted\nburglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is\nnot a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies\ncrimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies\nbecause they often lead to violence. As we have put it,\nthese crimes create \u201csignificant risks of . . . confrontation\nthat might result in bodily injury,\u201d id., at 199, and offen\nsive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when\none bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse\nquence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d\n418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\u201cIf burglary, with its tendency to\ncause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is\nconsidered a violent crime under 18 U. S.

The Court reasons that \u201c[i]t is unlikely\nthat Congress would select as a term of art defining \u2018vio\nlent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar\nmeaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.\u201d Ante, at\n7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216\u2013218 (1769), and ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court\ndoes not spell out why Congress\u2019 selection of this term\nwould be unlikely, but I assume that the Court\u2019s point is\nthat Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a\nviolent felony an offense that was regarded at common law\nas a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the\nsignificance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the\nsubsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita\ntion imposed by 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   At common law, the terms \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d\ndid not have the same meaning as they do today. At that\ntime, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);\nmost felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.\nGarner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious\ncrimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to\nmurder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See\nUnited States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439\u2013440 (1976)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm \u201cfelony\u201d has come to mean any offense punishable by\na lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one\nyear, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d has been reserved for\nminor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors\nat common law have been reclassified as felonies. And\nwhen the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a\nfew States had felony battery statutes that retained the\ncommon-law definition of \u201cforce.\u201d See Fla. Stat.\n6                  JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police\nofficer a felony); Idaho Code \u00a718\u2013915(c) (Lexis 1987)\n(same); Ill.

S.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nno doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the\nCourt\u2019s decision will be to take all these convictions out\nside the scope of ACCA\u2014unless the Government is able to\nproduce documents that may properly be consulted under\nthe modified categorical approach and that conclusively\nshow that the offender\u2019s conduct involved the use of vio\nlent force, see ante, at 10\u201311. As the Government notes,\nhowever, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both\nthe use of violent force and offensive touching, charging\ndocuments frequently simply track the language of the\nstatute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to\ndraw distinctions based on the type of force that the de\nfendant employed. See Brief for United States 42\u201343.\n   In addition, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d may hobble at least two federal statutes\nthat contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and\nthe term \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is\ndefined as applying only to crimes that \u201cha[ve], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (em\nphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog\nnized that \u201c \u2018many people who engage in serious spousal or\nchild abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of\nfelonies,\u2019 \u201d and Congress therefore enacted this provision to\nkeep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).\nCases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted\nunder generally applicable assault and battery statutes,\nibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of\nalmost half the States apply both to cases involving the\nuse of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.\nAs a result, if the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d in ACCA is applied to \u00a7922(g)(9), a great\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmany persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse\nwill be allowed to possess firearms.\n  Under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is subject to removal, and the\nterm \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is defined as an offense\nthat, among other things, has \u201cas an element the use [or]\nattempted use . . . of physical force.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a).\nAccordingly, if the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d is applied to this provision, many con\nvicted spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a\nresult that Congress is unlikely to have intended.\n                         *     *    *\n   For all these reasons, I believe that the Court\u2019s decision\nis incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
