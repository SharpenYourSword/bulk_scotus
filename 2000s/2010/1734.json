SHATZER\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND\n\n   No. 08\u2013680.      Argued October 5, 2009\u2014Decided February 24, 2010\nIn 2003, a police detective tried to question respondent Shatzer, who\n  was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction,\n  about allegations that he had sexually abused his son. Shatzer in\n  voked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interroga\n  tion, so the detective terminated the interview. Shatzer was released\n  back into the general prison population, and the investigation was\n  closed. Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and at\n  tempted to interrogate Shatzer, who was still incarcerated. Shatzer\n  waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements. The\n  trial court refused to suppress those statements, reasoning that Ed\n  wards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, did not apply because Shatzer had\n  experienced a break in Miranda custody prior to the 2006 interroga\n  tion. Shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse. The Court of Ap\n  peals of Maryland reversed, holding that the mere passage of time\n  does not end the Edwards protections, and that, assuming, arguendo,\n  a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed, Shatzer\u2019s release\n  back into the general prison population did not constitute such a\n  break.\nHeld: Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting\n more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at inter\n rogation, Edwards does not mandate suppression of his 2006 state\n ments. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the\n Miranda right to the presence of counsel, any waiver of that right in\n response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is\n involuntary. Edwards\u2019 fundamental purpose is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the\n integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only\n through counsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291, by \u201cpre\n vent[ing] police from badgering [him] into waiving his previously as\n2                        MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    serted Miranda rights,\u201d Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350. It is\n    easy to believe that a suspect\u2019s later waiver was coerced or badgered\n    when he has been held in uninterrupted Miranda custody since his\n    first refusal to waive. He remains cut off from his normal life and\n    isolated in a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n    U. S. 436, 456, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d Illi\n    nois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297. But where a suspect has been re\n    leased from custody and returned to his normal life for some time be\n    fore the later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to think\n    that his change of heart has been coerced. Because the Edwards pre\n    sumption has been established by opinion of this Court, it is appro\n    priate for this Court to specify the period of release from custody that\n    will terminate its application. See County of Riverside v. McLaugh\n    lin, 500 U. S. 44. The Court concludes that the appropriate period is\n    14 days, which provides ample time for the suspect to get reaccli\n    mated to his normal life, consult with friends and counsel, and shake\n    off any residual coercive effects of prior custody. Pp. 4\u201313.\n       (b) Shatzer\u2019s release back into the general prison population consti\n    tutes a break in Miranda custody. Lawful imprisonment imposed\n    upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by\n    investigative custody that justify Edwards. When previously incar\n    cerated suspects are released back into the general prison population,\n    they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014\n    they regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the\n    attempted interrogation. Their continued detention is relatively dis\n    connected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investiga\n    tion. The \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation\n    ended when Shatzer returned to his normal life.

MICHAEL BLAINE\n\n                SHATZER, SR. \n\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF\n\n                     MARYLAND\n\n                             [February 24, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider whether a break in custody ends the pre\u00ad\nsumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981).\n                             I\n  In August 2003, a social worker assigned to the Child\nAdvocacy Center in the Criminal Investigation Division of\nthe Hagerstown Police Department referred to the de\u00ad\npartment allegations that respondent Michael Shatzer,\nSr., had sexually abused his 3-year-old son. At that time,\nShatzer was incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional\nInstitution-Hagerstown, serving a sentence for an unre\u00ad\nlated child-sexual-abuse offense. Detective Shane Blank\u00ad\nenship was assigned to the investigation and interviewed\nShatzer at the correctional institution on August 7, 2003.\nBefore asking any questions, Blankenship reviewed\nShatzer\u2019s Miranda rights with him, and obtained a writ\u00ad\nten waiver of those rights. When Blankenship explained\nthat he was there to question Shatzer about sexually\nabusing his son, Shatzer expressed confusion\u2014he had\nthought Blankenship was an attorney there to discuss the\n2                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprior crime for which he was incarcerated. Blankenship\nclarified the purpose of his visit, and Shatzer declined to\nspeak without an attorney. Accordingly, Blankenship\nended the interview, and Shatzer was released back into\nthe general prison population.          Shortly thereafter,\nBlankenship closed the investigation.\n   Two years and six months later, the same social worker\nreferred more specific allegations to the department about\nthe same incident involving Shatzer. Detective Paul\nHoover, from the same division, was assigned to the inves\u00ad\ntigation. He and the social worker interviewed the victim,\nthen eight years old, who described the incident in more\ndetail. With this new information in hand, on March 2,\n2006, they went to the Roxbury Correctional Institute, to\nwhich Shatzer had since been transferred, and inter\u00ad\nviewed Shatzer in a maintenance room outfitted with a\ndesk and three chairs. Hoover explained that he wanted\nto ask Shatzer about the alleged incident involving\nShatzer\u2019s son. Shatzer was surprised because he thought\nthat the investigation had been closed, but Hoover ex\u00ad\nplained they had opened a new file. Hoover then read\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtained a written waiver\non a standard department form.\n   Hoover interrogated Shatzer about the incident for\napproximately 30 minutes. Shatzer denied ordering his\nson to perform fellatio on him, but admitted to masturbat\u00ad\ning in front of his son from a distance of less than three\nfeet. Before the interview ended, Shatzer agreed to Hoo\u00ad\nver\u2019s request that he submit to a polygraph examination.\nAt no point during the interrogation did Shatzer request\nto speak with an attorney or refer to his prior refusal to\nanswer questions without one.\n   Five days later, on March 7, 2006, Hoover and another\ndetective met with Shatzer at the correctional facility to\nadminister the polygraph examination. After reading\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtaining a written\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwaiver, the other detective administered the test and\nconcluded that Shatzer had failed. When the detectives\nthen questioned Shatzer, he became upset, started to cry,\nand incriminated himself by saying, \u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t force him. I\ndidn\u2019t force him.\u2019 \u201d 405 Md. 585, 590, 954 A. 2d 1118, 1121\n(2008). After making this inculpatory statement, Shatzer\nrequested an attorney, and Hoover promptly ended the\ninterrogation.\n   The State\u2019s Attorney for Washington County charged\nShatzer with second-degree sexual offense, sexual child\nabuse, second-degree assault, and contributing to condi\u00ad\ntions rendering a child in need of assistance. Shatzer\nmoved to suppress his March 2006 statements pursuant to\nEdwards. The trial court held a suppression hearing and\nlater denied Shatzer\u2019s motion. The Edwards protections\ndid not apply, it reasoned, because Shatzer had experi\u00ad\nenced a break in custody for Miranda purposes between\nthe 2003 and 2006 interrogations. No. 21\u2013K\u201306\u201337799\n(Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 14, 2006), App. 55.\nShatzer pleaded not guilty, waived his right to a jury trial,\nand proceeded to a bench trial based on an agreed state\u00ad\nment of facts. In accordance with the agreement, the\nState described the interview with the victim and\nShatzer\u2019s 2006 statements to the detectives. Based on the\nproffered testimony of the victim and the \u201cadmission of the\ndefendant as to the act of masturbation,\u201d the trial court\nfound Shatzer guilty of sexual child abuse of his son.1 No.\n21\u2013K\u201306\u201337799 (Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 21,\n2006), id., at 70, 79.\n   Over the dissent of two judges, the Court of Appeals of\nMaryland reversed and remanded. The court held that\n\u201cthe passage of time alone is insufficient to [end] the pro\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The State filed a nolle prosequi to the second-degree sexual offense\n\ncharge, and consented to dismissal of the misdemeanor charges as\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\n4                  MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntections afforded by Edwards,\u201d and that, assuming, ar\nguendo, a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed,\nShatzer\u2019s release back into the general prison population\nbetween interrogations did not constitute a break in cus\u00ad\ntody. 405 Md., at 606\u2013607, 954 A. 2d, at 1131. We\ngranted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n   The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the States by\nvirtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan,\n378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964), provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall\nbe compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. In Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted a set of prophylac\u00ad\ntic measures to protect a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment right\nfrom the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial\ninterrogation. Id., at 467. The Court observed that \u201cin\u00ad\ncommunicado interrogation\u201d in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d \u201cpolice\u00ad\ndominated atmosphere,\u201d id., at 456\u2013457, involves psycho\u00ad\nlogical pressures \u201cwhich work to undermine the individ\u00ad\nual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he\nwould not otherwise do so freely,\u201d id., at 467. Conse\u00ad\nquently, it reasoned, \u201c[u]nless adequate protective devices\nare employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custo\u00ad\ndial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defen\u00ad\ndant can truly be the product of his free choice.\u201d Id., at\n458.\n   To counteract the coercive pressure, Miranda an\u00ad\nnounced that police officers must warn a suspect prior to\nquestioning that he has a right to remain silent, and a\nright to the presence of an attorney. Id., at 444. After the\nwarnings are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes\nto remain silent, the interrogation must cease. Id., at\n473\u2013474. Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an\nattorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is\npresent. Id., at 474. Critically, however, a suspect can\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwaive these rights. Id., at 475. To establish a valid\nwaiver, the State must show that the waiver was knowing,\nintelligent, and voluntary under the \u201chigh standar[d] of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in]\nJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).\u201d Id., at 475.\n   In Edwards, the Court determined that Zerbst\u2019s tradi\u00ad\ntional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a\nsuspect\u2019s right to have counsel present at a subsequent\ninterrogation if he had previously requested counsel;\n\u201cadditional safeguards\u201d were necessary. 451 U. S., at 484.\nThe Court therefore superimposed a \u201csecond layer of\nprophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176\n(1991). Edwards held:\n    \u201c[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have\n    counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid\n    waiver of that right cannot be established by showing\n    only that he responded to further police-initiated cus\u00ad\n    todial interrogation even if he has been advised of his\n    rights. . . . [He] is not subject to further interrogation\n    by the authorities until counsel has been made avail\u00ad\n    able to him, unless the accused himself initiates fur\u00ad\n    ther communication, exchanges, or conversations with\n    the police.\u201d 451 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\nThe rationale of Edwards is that once a suspect indicates\nthat \u201che is not capable of undergoing [custodial] question\u00ad\ning without advice of counsel,\u201d \u201cany subsequent waiver\nthat has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the\nsuspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of the \u2018in\u00ad\nherently compelling pressures\u2019 and not the purely volun\u00ad\ntary choice of the suspect.\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.\n675, 681 (1988). Under this rule, a voluntary Miranda\nwaiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted\ninterrogation to protect a suspect\u2019s right to have counsel\npresent, but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent\nattempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of\n6                  MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the\nsubsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly\ngreater risk of coercion. That increased risk results not\nonly from the police\u2019s persistence in trying to get the sus\u00ad\npect to talk, but also from the continued pressure that\nbegins when the individual is taken into custody as a\nsuspect and sought to be interrogated\u2014pressure likely to\n\u201cincrease as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick v. Mississippi,\n498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990). The Edwards presumption of\ninvoluntariness ensures that police will not take advan\u00ad\ntage of the mounting coercive pressures of \u201cprolonged\npolice custody,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, by repeatedly\nattempting to question a suspect who previously requested\ncounsel until the suspect is \u201cbadgered into submission,\u201d\nid., at 690 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   We have frequently emphasized that the Edwards rule\nis not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed\nprophylaxis. See, e.g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 7\u20138); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S.\n344, 349 (1990); Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, 644, n. 4\n(1984). Because Edwards is \u201cour rule, not a constitutional\ncommand,\u201d \u201cit is our obligation to justify its expansion.\u201d\nRoberson, supra, at 688 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Lower\ncourts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends\nthe Edwards presumption, see, e.g., People v. Storm, 28\nCal. 4th 1007, 1023\u20131024, and n. 6, 52 P. 3d 52, 61\u201362,\nand n. 6 (2002) (collecting state and federal cases), but we\nhave previously addressed the issue only in dicta, see\nMcNeil, supra, at 177 (Edwards applies \u201cassuming there\nhas been no break in custody\u201d).\n   A judicially crafted rule is \u201cjustified only by reference to\nits prophylactic purpose,\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S.\n452, 458 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\napplies only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Montejo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). We begin with the benefits.\nEdwards\u2019 presumption of involuntariness has the inciden\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntal effect of \u201cconserv[ing] judicial resources which would\notherwise be expended in making difficult determinations\nof voluntariness.\u201d Minnick, supra, at 151. Its fundamen\u00ad\ntal purpose, however, is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the integrity of an\naccused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through\ncounsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988), by\n\u201cprevent[ing] police from badgering a defendant into waiv\u00ad\ning his previously asserted Miranda rights,\u201d Harvey,\nsupra, at 350. Thus, the benefits of the rule are measured\nby the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that\notherwise would have been admitted. See Montejo, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   It is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or\nbadgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be ques\u00ad\ntioned without counsel in the paradigm Edwards case.\nThat is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a\nparticular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial\ncustody while that crime is being actively investigated.\nAfter the initial interrogation, and up to and including the\nsecond one, he remains cut off from his normal life and\ncompanions, \u201cthrust into\u201d and isolated in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d\n\u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at\n456\u2013457, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d\nIllinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297 (1990). That was the\nsituation confronted by the suspects in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, the three cases in which we have\nheld the Edwards rule applicable. Edwards was arrested\npursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where\nhe was interrogated until he requested counsel. Edwards,\n451 U. S., at 478\u2013479. The officer ended the interrogation\nand took him to the county jail,2 but at 9:15 the next\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Jail is a \u201clocal government\u2019s detention center where persons await\u00ad\ning trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009).

Minnick was arrested by local police and\ntaken to the San Diego jail, where two FBI agents interro\u00ad\ngated him the next morning until he requested counsel.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 148\u2013149. Two days later a Missis\u00ad\nsippi Deputy Sheriff reinterrogated him at the jail. Id., at\n149. None of these suspects regained a sense of control or\nnormalcy after they were initially taken into custody for\nthe crime under investigation.\n   When, unlike what happened in these three cases, a\nsuspect has been released from his pretrial custody and\nhas returned to his normal life for some time before the\nlater attempted interrogation, there is little reason to\nthink that his change of heart regarding interrogation\nwithout counsel has been coerced. He has no longer been\nisolated. He has likely been able to seek advice from an\nattorney, family members, and friends.3 And he knows\nfrom his earlier experience that he need only demand\ncounsel to bring the interrogation to a halt; and that in\u00ad\nvestigative custody does not last indefinitely. In these\ncircumstances, it is far fetched to think that a police offi\u00ad\ncer\u2019s asking the suspect whether he would like to waive\nhis Miranda rights will any more \u201cwear down the ac\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 JUSTICESTEVENS points out, post, at 7 (opinion concurring in judg\u00ad\nment), that in Minnick, actual pre-reinterrogation consultation with an\nattorney during continued custody did not suffice to avoid application of\nEdwards. That does not mean that the ability to consult freely with\nattorneys and others does not reduce the level of coercion at all, or that\nit is \u201conly questionably relevant,\u201d post, at 7, to whether termination of\ncustody reduces the coercive pressure that is the basis for Edwards\u2019\nsuper-prophylactic rule.\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncused,\u201d Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98 (1984) (per cu\nriam), than did the first such request at the original at\u00ad\ntempted interrogation\u2014which is of course not deemed\ncoercive. His change of heart is less likely attributable to\n\u201cbadgering\u201d than it is to the fact that further deliberation\nin familiar surroundings has caused him to believe\n(rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with the investiga\u00ad\ntion is in his interest. Uncritical extension of Edwards to\nthis situation would not significantly increase the number\nof genuinely coerced confessions excluded. The \u201cjustifica\u00ad\ntion for a conclusive presumption disappears when appli\u00ad\ncation of the presumption will not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n737 (1991).\n   At the same time that extending the Edwards rule\nyields diminished benefits, extending the rule also in\u00ad\ncreases its costs: the in-fact voluntary confessions it ex\u00ad\ncludes from trial, and the voluntary confessions it deters\nlaw enforcement officers from even trying to obtain. Vol\u00ad\nuntary confessions are not merely \u201ca proper element in\nlaw enforcement,\u201d Miranda, supra, at 478, they are an\n\u201cunmitigated good,\u201d McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181, \u201c \u2018essential\nto society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and\npunishing those who violate the law,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).\n   The only logical endpoint of Edwards disability is ter\u00ad\nmination of Miranda custody and any of its lingering\neffects. Without that limitation\u2014and barring some purely\narbitrary time-limit4\u2014every Edwards prohibition of cus\u00ad\ntodial interrogation of a particular suspect would be eter\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  State\u2019s alternative argument in the present case is that the\nsubstantial lapse in time between the 2003 and 2006 attempts at\ninterrogation independently ended the Edwards presumption. Our\ndisposition makes it unnecessary to address that argument.\n10                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal. The prohibition applies, of course, when the subse\u00ad\nquent interrogation pertains to a different crime,\nRoberson, supra, when it is conducted by a different law\nenforcement authority, Minnick, 498 U. S. 146, and even\nwhen the suspect has met with an attorney after the first\ninterrogation, ibid. And it not only prevents questioning\nex ante; it would render invalid ex post, confessions invited\nand obtained from suspects who (unbeknownst to the\ninterrogators) have acquired Edwards immunity previ\u00ad\nously in connection with any offense in any jurisdiction.5\nIn a country that harbors a large number of repeat offend\u00ad\ners,6 this consequence is disastrous.\n  We conclude that such an extension of Edwards is not\njustified; we have opened its \u201cprotective umbrella,\u201d Solem,\n465 U. S., at 644, n. 4, far enough. The protections offered\nby Miranda, which we have deemed sufficient to ensure\nthat the police respect the suspect\u2019s desire to have an\nattorney present the first time police interrogate him,\nadequately ensure that result when a suspect who initially\nrequested counsel is reinterrogated after a break in cus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 This assumes that Roberson\u2019s extension of Edwards to subsequent\n\ninterrogation for a different crime, and Minnick\u2019s extension of Edwards\nto subsequent interrogation by a different law enforcement agency\nwould apply even when the place of custody and the identity of the\ncustodial agency are not the same (as they were in Roberson and\nMinnick) as those of the original interrogation. That assumption would\nseem reasonable if the Edwards-suspending effect of a termination of\ncustody is rejected. Reinterrogation in different custody or by a differ\u00ad\nent interrogating agency would seem, if anything, less likely than\ntermination of custody to reduce coercive pressures. At the original\nsite, and with respect to the original interrogating agency, the suspect\nhas already experienced cessation of interrogation when he demands\ncounsel\u2014which he may have no reason to expect elsewhere.\n   6 According to a recent study, 67.5% of prisoners released from 15\n\nStates in 1994 were rearrested within three years. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report, Recidivism of Prisoners\nReleased in 1994 (NCJ 193427, 2002).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive\neffects.\n  If Shatzer\u2019s return to the general prison population\nqualified as a break in custody (a question we address in\nPart III, infra), there is no doubt that it lasted long\nenough (2\u00bd years) to meet that durational requirement.\nBut what about a break that has lasted only one year? Or\nonly one week? It is impractical to leave the answer to\nthat question for clarification in future case-by-case adju\u00ad\ndication; law enforcement officers need to know, with\ncertainty and beforehand, when renewed interrogation is\nlawful. And while it is certainly unusual for this Court to\nset forth precise time limits governing police action, it is\nnot unheard-of. In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n500 U. S. 44 (1991), we specified 48 hours as the time\nwithin which the police must comply with the requirement\nof Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), that a person\narrested without a warrant be brought before a magistrate\nto establish probable cause for continued detention.\n  Like McLaughlin, this is a case in which the requisite\npolice action (there, presentation to a magistrate; here,\nabstention from further interrogation) has not been pre\u00ad\nscribed by statute but has been established by opinion of\nthis Court. We think it appropriate to specify a period of\ntime to avoid the consequence that continuation of the\nEdwards presumption \u201cwill not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman, supra, at 737. It seems to us\nthat period is 14 days. That provides plenty of time for\nthe suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to con\u00ad\nsult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any resid\u00ad\nual coercive effects of his prior custody.\n  The 14-day limitation meets Shatzer\u2019s concern that a\nbreak-in-custody rule lends itself to police abuse. He\nenvisions that once a suspect invokes his Miranda right to\ncounsel, the police will release the suspect briefly (to end\nthe Edwards presumption) and then promptly bring him\n12                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nback into custody for reinterrogation. But once the sus\u00ad\npect has been out of custody long enough (14 days) to\neliminate its coercive effect, there will be nothing to gain\nby such gamesmanship\u2014nothing, that is, except the en\u00ad\ntirely appropriate gain of being able to interrogate a sus\u00ad\npect who has made a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.7\n   Shatzer argues that ending the Edwards protections at\na break in custody will undermine Edwards\u2019 purpose to\nconserve judicial resources. To be sure, we have said that\n\u201c[t]he merit of the Edwards decision lies in the clarity of\nits command and the certainty of its application.\u201d\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 151. But clarity and certainty are\nnot goals in themselves. They are valuable only when\nthey reasonably further the achievement of some substan\u00ad\ntive end\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions.\nConfessions obtained after a 2-week break in custody and\na waiver of Miranda rights are most unlikely to be com\u00ad\npelled, and hence are unreasonably excluded. In any case,\na break-in-custody exception will dim only marginally, if\nat all, the bright-line nature of Edwards. In every case\ninvolving Edwards, the courts must determine whether\nthe suspect was in custody when he requested counsel and\nwhen he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.\nNow, in cases where there is an alleged break in custody,\nthey simply have to repeat the inquiry for the time be\u00ad\ntween the initial invocation and reinterrogation. In most\ncases that determination will be easy. And when it is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A defendant who experiences a 14-day break in custody after invok\u00ad\n\ning the Miranda right to counsel is not left without protection. Ed\nwards establishes a presumption that a suspect\u2019s waiver of Miranda\nrights is involuntary. See Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 681\n(1988). Even without this \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), a defendant is still free to claim\nthe prophylactic protection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of\nMiranda rights was in fact involuntary under Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938). See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the defendant pleading Edwards has\nbeen out of custody for two weeks before the contested\ninterrogation, the court is spared the fact-intensive in\u00ad\nquiry into whether he ever, anywhere, asserted his\nMiranda right to counsel.\n                             III\n  The facts of this case present an additional issue. No\none questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda\npurposes during the interviews with Detective\nBlankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006. Like\u00ad\nwise, no one questions that Shatzer triggered the Edwards\nprotections when, according to Detective Blankenship\u2019s\nnotes of the 2003 interview, he stated that \u201c \u2018he would not\ntalk about this case without having an attorney present,\u2019 \u201d\n405 Md., at 589, 954 A. 2d, at 1120. After the 2003 inter\u00ad\nview, Shatzer was released back into the general prison\npopulation where he was serving an unrelated sentence.\nThe issue is whether that constitutes a break in Miranda\ncustody.\n  We have never decided whether incarceration consti\u00ad\ntutes custody for Miranda purposes, and have indeed\nexplicitly declined to address the issue. See Perkins, 496\nU. S., at 299. See also Bradley v. Ohio, 497 U. S. 1011,\n1013 (1990) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). Whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the\ncoercive pressure that Miranda was designed to guard\nagainst\u2014the \u201cdanger of coercion [that] results from the\ninteraction of custody and official interrogation.\u201d Perkins,\nsupra, at 297 (emphasis added). To determine whether a\nsuspect was in Miranda custody we have asked whether\n\u201cthere is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of move\u00ad\nment\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d New\nYork v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984); see also Stans\nbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam).\nThis test, no doubt, is satisfied by all forms of incarcera\u00ad\n14                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion. Our cases make clear, however, that the freedom-of\u00ad\nmovement test identifies only a necessary and not a suffi\u00ad\ncient condition for Miranda custody. We have declined to\naccord it \u201ctalismanic power,\u201d because Miranda is to be\nenforced \u201conly in those types of situations in which the\nconcerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d\nBerkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, the\ntemporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in\u00ad\nvolved in a traffic stop or Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968), does not constitute Miranda custody.\nMcCarty, supra, at 439\u2013440. See also Perkins, supra, at\n296.\n   Here, we are addressing the interim period during\nwhich a suspect was not interrogated, but was subject to a\nbaseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior\nconviction. Without minimizing the harsh realities of\nincarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed\nupon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive\npressures identified in Miranda.\n   Interrogated suspects who have previously been con\u00ad\nvicted of crime live in prison. When they are released\nback into the general prison population, they return to\ntheir accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014they\nregain the degree of control they had over their lives prior\nto the interrogation. Sentenced prisoners, in contrast to\nthe Miranda paradigm, are not isolated with their accus\u00ad\ners. They live among other inmates, guards, and workers,\nand often can receive visitors and communicate with\npeople on the outside by mail or telephone.\n   Their detention, moreover, is relatively disconnected\nfrom their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investi\u00ad\ngation. The former interrogator has no power to increase\nthe duration of incarceration, which was determined at\nsentencing.8 And even where the possibility of parole\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 We   distinguish the duration of incarceration from the duration of\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nexists, the former interrogator has no apparent power to\ndecrease the time served. This is in stark contrast to the\ncircumstances faced by the defendants in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, whose continued detention as\nsuspects rested with those controlling their interrogation,\nand who confronted the uncertainties of what final\ncharges they would face, whether they would be convicted,\nand what sentence they would receive.\n   Shatzer\u2019s experience illustrates the vast differences\nbetween Miranda custody and incarceration pursuant to\nconviction. At the time of the 2003 attempted interroga\u00ad\ntion, Shatzer was already serving a sentence for a prior\nconviction. After that, he returned to the general prison\npopulation in the Maryland Correctional Institution-\nHagerstown and was later transferred, for unrelated\nreasons, down the street to the Roxbury Correctional\nInstitute. Both are medium-security state correctional\nfacilities. See Maryland Div. of Correction Inmate Hand\u00ad\nbook 7 (2007), online at http://dpscs.md.gov/rehabservs/\ndoc/pdfs/2007_Inmate_Handbook.pdf (all Internet materi\u00ad\nals as visited Feb. 22, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).

When a prisoner is\nremoved from the general prison population and taken to a separate\nlocation for questioning, the duration of that separation is assuredly\ndependent upon his interrogators. For which reason once he has\nasserted a refusal to speak without assistance of counsel Edwards\nprevents any efforts to get him to change his mind during that inter\u00ad\nrogative custody.\n16                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntention after the 2003 interrogation did not depend on\nwhat he said (or did not say) to Detective Blankenship,\nand he has not alleged that he was placed in a higher level\nof security or faced any continuing restraints as a result of\nthe 2003 interrogation. The \u201cinherently compelling pres\u00ad\nsures\u201d of custodial interrogation ended when he returned\nto his normal life.\n                                IV\n  A few words in response to JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 concur\u00ad\nrence: It claims we ignore that \u201c[w]hen police tell an indi\u00ad\ngent suspect that he has the right to an attorney\u201d and\nthen \u201creinterrogate\u201d him without providing a lawyer, \u201cthe\nsuspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that\nhe really does not have any right to a lawyer.\u201d Post, at 2\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (hereinafter concur\u00ad\nrence). See also post, at 4, 7, n. 11, 11, n. 16. The fallacy\nhere is that we are not talking about \u201creinterrogating\u201d the\nsuspect; we are talking about asking his permission to be\ninterrogated. An officer has in no sense lied to a suspect\nwhen, after advising, as Miranda requires, \u201cYou have the\nright to remain silent, and if you choose to speak you have\nthe right to the presence of an attorney,\u201d he promptly ends\nthe attempted interrogation because the suspect declines\nto speak without counsel present, and then, two weeks\nlater, reapproaches the suspect and asks, \u201cAre you now\nwilling to speak without a lawyer present?\u201d\n  The \u201cconcer[n] that motivated the Edwards line of\ncases,\u201d post, at 2\u20133, n. 2, is that the suspect will be coerced\ninto saying yes. That concern guides our decision today.\nContrary to the concurrence\u2019s conclusion, post, at 3, 5\u20136,\nthere is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession\nas \u201c \u2018the only way to end his interrogation\u2019 \u201d when, before\nthe interrogation begins, he is told that he can avoid it by\nsimply requesting that he not be interrogated without\ncounsel present\u2014an option that worked before.

S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcurrence argues will often be the case, post, at 5, a\nbreak in custody does not change the suspect\u2019s mind, he\nneed only say so.\n   The concurrence also accuses the Court of \u201cignor[ing]\nthat when a suspect asks for counsel, until his request is\nanswered, there are still the same \u2018inherently compelling\u2019\npressures of custodial interrogation on which the Miranda\nline of cases is based.\u201d Post, at 4. We do not ignore these\npressures; nor do we suggest that they disappear when\ncustody is recommenced after a break, see post, at 5. But\nif those pressures are merely \u201cthe same\u201d as before, then\nMiranda provides sufficient protection\u2014as it did before.\nThe Edwards presumption of involuntariness is justified\nonly in circumstances where the coercive pressures have\nincreased so much that suspects\u2019 waivers of Miranda\nrights are likely to be involuntary most of the time. Con\u00ad\ntrary to the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, post, at 3, it is only\nin those narrow circumstances\u2014when custody is unbro\u00ad\nken\u2014that the Court has concluded a \u201cfresh se[t] of\nMiranda warnings\u201d is not sufficient. See Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 686.\n   In the last analysis, it turns out that the concurrence\naccepts our principal points. It agrees that Edwards\nprophylaxis is not perpetual; it agrees that a break in\ncustody reduces the inherently compelling pressure upon\nwhich Edwards was based; it agrees that Shatzer\u2019s release\nback into the general prison population constituted a\nbreak in custody; and it agrees that in this case the break\nwas long enough to render Edwards inapplicable. Post, at\n10\u201312. We differ in two respects: Instead of terminating\nEdwards protection when the custodial pressures that\nwere the basis for that protection dissipate, the concur\u00ad\nrence would terminate it when the suspect would no\nlonger \u201cfeel that he has \u2018been denied the counsel he has\nclearly requested,\u2019 \u201d post, at 11. This is entirely unrelated\nto the rationale of Edwards. If confidence in the police\u2019s\n18                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npromise to provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards\nwould not have applied in Minnick, where the suspect in\ncontinuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.\nThe concurrence\u2019s rule is also entirely unrelated to the\nexistence of a break in custody. While that may relieve\nthe accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the\nfoundation for Edwards, it is hard to see how it bolsters\nthe suspect\u2019s confidence that if he asks for counsel he will\nget one.\n   And secondly, the concurrence differs from us in declin\u00ad\ning to say how long after a break in custody the termina\u00ad\ntion of Edwards protection occurs. Two and one-half\nyears, it says, is clearly enough\u2014but it gives law enforce\u00ad\nment authorities no further guidance. The concurrence\ncriticizes our use of 14 days as arbitrary and unexplained,\npost, at 5, and n. 7. But in fact that rests upon the same\nbasis as the concurrence\u2019s own approval of a 21\u20442-year\nbreak in custody: how much time will justify \u201ctreating the\nsecond interrogation as no more coercive than the first,\u201d\npost, at 10. Failure to say where the line falls short of 21\u20442\nyears, and leaving that for future case-by-case determina\u00ad\ntion, is certainly less helpful, but not at all less arbitrary.\n                        *     *     *\n  Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody lasting more than two weeks between the first and\nsecond attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not man\u00ad\ndate suppression of his March 2006 statements. Accord\u00ad\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals of\nMaryland, and remand the case for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

I do not join the Court\u2019s decision to\nextend the presumption of involuntariness established in\nEdwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), for 14 days after\ncustody ends.\n   It is not apparent to me that the presumption of in\nvoluntariness the Court recognized in Edwards is justifi\nable even in the custodial setting to which Edwards ap\nplies it. See, e.g., Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146,\n160 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I would\nnot extend the Edwards rule \u201cbeyond the circumstances\npresent in Edwards itself.\u201d Id., at 162. But even if one\nbelieves that the Court is obliged to apply Edwards to any\ncase involving continuing custody, the Court\u2019s opinion\ntoday goes well beyond that. It extends the presumption\nof involuntariness Edwards applies in custodial settings to\ninterrogations that occur after custody ends.\n   The Court concedes that this extension, like the Ed\nwards presumption itself, is not constitutionally required.\nThe Court nevertheless defends the extension as a judi\ncially created prophylaxis against compelled confessions.\nEven if one accepts that such prophylaxis is both permis\n2                     MARYLAND v.

Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), maintain \u201cthe closest possible fit\u201d\nbetween the rule and the Fifth Amendment interests they\nseek to protect. United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,\n640\u2013641 (2004) (plurality opinion); see generally Montejo\nv. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18);\nChavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 772 (2003) (plurality\nopinion). The Court\u2019s 14-day rule does not satisfy this\ntest. The Court relates its 14-day rule to the Fifth\nAmendment simply by asserting that 14 days between\nrelease and recapture should provide \u201cplenty of time for\nthe suspect . . . to shake off any residual coercive effects of\nhis prior custody,\u201d ante, at 11.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At a minimum the latter proposition is questionable. I concede that\n\nsome police officers might badger a suspect during a subsequent inter\nrogation after a break in custody, or might use catch-and-release tactics\nto suggest they will not take no for an answer. But if a suspect reenters\ncustody after being questioned and released, he need only invoke his\nright to counsel to ensure Edwards\u2019 protection for the duration of the\nsubsequent detention. And, if law enforcement officers repeatedly\nrelease and recapture a suspect to wear down his will\u2014such that his\nparticipation in a subsequent interrogation is no longer truly volun\ntary\u2014the \u201chigh standar[d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional\nrights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938),\u201d will\nprotect against the admission of the suspect\u2019s statements in court.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 475 (1966). The Zerbst inquiry\ntakes into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the\nwaiver\u2014including any improper pressures by police. See id., at 464; cf.\nante, at 11\u201312, n. 6 (stating that \u201c[e]ven without [Edwards\u2019] second\nlayer of prophylaxis, a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic\nprotection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of Miranda rights was\nin fact involuntary under Johnson v.

Nor does it explain how the benefits of a prophy\nlactic 14-day rule (either on its own terms or compared\nwith other possible rules) \u201coutweigh its costs\u201d (which\nwould include the loss of law enforcement information as\nwell as the exclusion of confessions that are in fact volun\ntary). Ante, at 6 (citing Montejo, supra, at __ (slip op., at\n14)).\n   To be sure, the Court\u2019s rule has the benefit of providing\na bright line. Ante, at 12. But bright-line rules are not\nnecessary to prevent Fifth Amendment violations, as the\nCourt has made clear when refusing to adopt such rules in\ncases involving other Miranda rights. See, e.g., Michigan\nv. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103\u2013104 (1975). And an otherwise\narbitrary rule is not justifiable merely because it gives\nclear instruction to law enforcement officers.2\n   As the Court concedes, \u201cclarity and certainty are not\ngoals in themselves. They are valuable only when they\nreasonably further the achievement of some substantive\nend\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions\u201d that\nthe Fifth Amendment prohibits. Ante, at 12. The Court\u2019s\narbitrary 14-day rule fails this test, even under the rela\ntively permissive criteria set forth in our precedents.\nAccordingly, I do not join that portion of the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Though the Court asserts that its 14-day rule will tell \u201claw enforce\n\nment officers . . . with certainty and beforehand, when renewed interro\ngation is lawful,\u201d ante, at 10, that is not so clear. Determining whether\na suspect was previously in custody, and when the suspect was re\nleased, may be difficult without questioning the suspect, especially if\nstate and federal authorities are conducting simultaneous investiga\ntions.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

S. 477 (1981), is not \u201ceternal,\u201d ante, at 9\u2013\n10, and does not mandate suppression of Shatzer\u2019s state\u00ad\nment made after a 2\u00bd-year break in custody, I do not\nagree with the Court\u2019s newly announced rule: that Ed\nwards always ceases to apply when there is a 14-day\nbreak in custody, ante, at 11.\n  In conducting its \u201ccost-benefit\u201d analysis, the Court\ndemeans Edwards as a \u201c \u2018second layer\u2019 \u201d of \u201cjudicially pre\u00ad\nscribed prophylaxis,\u201d ante, at 5, 6, 12, n. 7; see also ante, at\n6 (describing Edwards as \u201c \u2018our rule, not a constitutional\ncommand\u2019 \u201d (quoting Arizona v.

The source of the\nholdings in the long line of cases that includes both Ed\nwards and Miranda, however, is the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nprotection against compelled self-incrimination applied to\nthe \u201ccompulsion inherent in custodial\u201d interrogation,\nMiranda v.

When police tell an indigent suspect that he has\nthe right to an attorney, that he is not required to speak\nwithout an attorney present, and that an attorney will be\nprovided to him at no cost before questioning, the police\nhave made a significant promise. If they cease question\u00ad\ning and then reinterrogate the suspect 14 days later with\u00ad\nout providing him with a lawyer, the suspect is likely to\nfeel that the police lied to him and that he really does not\nhave any right to a lawyer.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFourteenth Amendments were violated by the use of his confession\nobtained by police-instigated interrogation\u2014without counsel present\u2014\nafter he requested an attorney\u201d); Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U. S. 1039,\n1043 (1983) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[The] subsequent incriminating\nstatements made without [an] attorney present violated the rights\nsecured to the defendant by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution\u201d); Miranda, 384 U. S., at 458 (examin\u00ad\ning the \u201chistory and precedent underlying the Self-Incrimination\nClause to determine its applicability in this situation\u201d).\n   2 The Court states that this argument rests on a \u201cfallacy\u201d because \u201cwe\n\nare not talking about \u2018reinterrogating\u2019 the suspect; we are talking about\nasking his permission to be interrogated.\u201d Ante, at 16 (emphasis\ndeleted). Because, however, a suspect always has the right to remain\nsilent, this is a distinction without a difference: Any time that the\npolice interrogate or reinterrogate, and read a suspect his Miranda\nrights, the suspect may decline to speak. And if this is a \u201cfallacy,\u201d it is\nthe same \u201cfallacy\u201d upon which this Court has relied in the Edwards line\nof cases that held that police may not continue to interrogate a suspect\nwho has requested a lawyer: Police may not continue to ask such a\nsuspect whether they may interrogate him until that suspect has a\nlawyer present. The Court\u2019s apparent belief that this is a \u201cfallacy\u201d only\nunderscores my concern that its analysis is insufficiently sensitive to\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

But if an\nindigent suspect requests a lawyer, \u201cany further interro\u00ad\ngation\u201d (even 14 days later) \u201cwithout counsel having been\nprovided will surely exacerbate whatever compulsion to\nspeak the suspect may be feeling.\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at\n686. When police have not honored an earlier commit\u00ad\nment to provide a detainee with a lawyer, the detainee\nlikely will \u201cunderstan[d] his (expressed) wishes to have\nbeen ignored\u201d and \u201cmay well see further objection as futile\nand confession (true or not) as the only way to end his\ninterrogation.\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 472\u2013\n473 (1994) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). Cf. Coo\nper v. Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1225 (CA9 1992) (en banc)\n(describing an elaborate police task force plan to ignore a\nsuspect\u2019s requests for counsel, on the theory that such\nwould induce hopelessness and thereby elicit an admis\u00ad\nsion). Simply giving a \u201cfresh se[t] of Miranda warnings\u201d\nwill not \u201c \u2018reassure\u2019 a suspect who has been denied the\ncounsel he has clearly requested that his rights have\nremained untrammeled.\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686.\n                              II\n  The Court never explains why its rule cannot depend on,\nin addition to a break in custody and passage of time, a\nconcrete event or state of affairs, such as the police having\nhonored their commitment to provide counsel. Instead,\nthe Court simply decides to create a time-based rule, and\nin so doing, disregards much of the analysis upon which\nEdwards and subsequent decisions were based. \u201c[T]he\nassertion of the right to counsel\u201d \u201c[i]s a significant event.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe concerns that motivated the Edwards line of cases.\n  3 Indeed, a lawyer has a \u201cunique ability to protect the Fifth Amend\u00ad\n\nment rights of a client undergoing custodial interrogation.\u201d Fare v.\n4                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nEdwards, 451 U. S., at 485. As the Court today acknowl\u00ad\nedges, the right to counsel, like the right to remain silent,\nis one that police may \u201ccoerc[e] or badge[r],\u201d ante, at 7, a\nsuspect into abandoning.4 However, as discussed above,\nthe Court ignores the effects not of badgering but of rein\u00ad\nterrogating a suspect who took the police at their word\nthat he need not answer questions without an attorney\npresent. See Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686. The Court,\nmoreover, ignores that when a suspect asks for counsel,\nuntil his request is answered, there are still the same\n\u201cinherently compelling\u201d pressures of custodial interroga\u00ad\ntion on which the Miranda line of cases is based, see 486\nU. S., at 681,5 and that the concern about compulsion is\nespecially serious for a detainee who has requested a\nlawyer, an act that signals his \u201cinability to cope with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMichael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719 (1979). Counsel can curb an officer\u2019s\noverbearing conduct, advise a suspect of his rights, and ensure that\nthere is an accurate record of any interrogation. \u201cBecause of this\nspecial ability of the lawyer to help the client preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights once the client becomes enmeshed in the adversary\nprocess, the Court found that the right to have counsel present at the\ninterrogation is indispensible to the protection of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege.\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682, n. 4 (1988) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201conce the accused has requested\ncounsel,\u201d courts must be especially wary of \u201ccoercive form[s] of custodial\ninterrogation.\u201d Bradshaw, 462 U.

But its opinion gives\nno strong basis for believing that this is the case.7 A 14\u00ad\nday break in custody does not eliminate the rationale for\nthe initial Edwards rule: The detainee has been told that\nhe may remain silent and speak only through a lawyer\nand that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be pro\u00ad\nvided for him. He has asked for a lawyer. He does not\nhave one. He is in custody. And police are still question\u00ad\ning him. A 14-day break in custody does not change the\nfact that custodial interrogation is inherently compelling.\nIt is unlikely to change the fact that a detainee \u201cconsiders\nhimself unable to deal with the pressures of custodial\ninterrogation without legal assistance.\u201d Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 683.8 And in some instances, a 14-day break in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See  Roberson, 486 U. S., at 681 (\u201c[I]f a suspect believes that he is not\ncapable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then\nit is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the au\u00ad\nthorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the\nproduct of the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 \u201d); Michigan v. Mosley,\n423 U. S. 96, 110, n. 2 (1975) (White, J., concurring in result) (\u201c[T]he\naccused having expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal\nwith the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the au\u00ad\nthorities\u2019 insistence to make a statement without counsel\u2019s presence\nmay properly be viewed with skepticism\u201d).\n   7 Today\u2019s decision, moreover, offers no reason for its 14-day time pe\u00ad\n\nriod. To be sure, it may be difficult to marshal conclusive evidence\nwhen setting an arbitrary time period. But in light of the basis for\nEdwards, we should tread carefully. Instead, the only reason for\nchoosing a 14-day time period, the Court tells us, is that \u201c[i]t seems to\nus that period is 14 days.\u201d Ante, at 11. That time period is \u201cplenty of\ntime for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult\nwith friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects\nof his prior custody.\u201d Ibid. But the Court gives no reason for that\nspeculation, which may well prove inaccurate in many circumstances.\n   8 In Roberson, for example, we observed that once a suspect has as\u00ad\n6                       MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncustody may make matters worse 9 \u201c[w]hen a suspect\nunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored\u201d\nand thus \u201cmay well see further objection as futile and\nconfession (true or not) as the only way to end his interro\u00ad\ngation.\u201d Davis, 512 U. S., at 472\u2013473 (Souter, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment).10\n  The Court ignores these understandings from the Ed\nwards line of cases and instead speculates that if a suspect\nis reinterrogated and eventually talks, it must be that\n\u201cfurther deliberation in familiar surroundings has caused\nhim to believe (rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with\nthe investigation is in his interest.\u201d Ante, at 9. But it is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nserted his right to an attorney, courts must presume he does \u201cnot feel\nsufficiently comfortable with the pressures of custodial interrogation to\nanswer questions without an attorney. This discomfort is precisely the\nstate of mind that Edwards presumes to persist . . . .\u201d 486 U. S., at 684.\nWe held in Roberson that just because different police come to speak\nabout a different investigation, that presumption does not change:\n\u201c[T]here is no reason to assume that a suspect\u2019s state of mind is in any\nway investigation-specific.\u201d Ibid. Nor is there any reason to believe\nthat it is arrest specific.\n    9 The compulsion is heightened by the fact that \u201c[t]he uncertainty of\n\nfate that being released from custody and then reapprehended entails\nis, in some circumstances, more coercive than continual custody.\u201d\nStrauss, Reinterrogation, 22 Hastings Const. L. Q. 359, 390 (1995).\n    10 Not only is this a likely effect of reinterrogation, but police may use\n\nthis effect to their advantage. Indeed, the Court\u2019s rule creates a\nstrange incentive to delay formal proceedings, in order to gain addi\u00ad\ntional information by way of interrogation after the time limit lapses.\nThe justification for Fifth Amendment rules \u201cmust be consistent with\n. . . practical realities,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 688 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting), and the reality is that police may operate within the\nconfines of the Fifth Amendment in order to extract as many confes\u00ad\nsions as possible, see Leo & White, Adapting to Miranda: Modern\nInterrogators\u2019 Strategies for Dealing with the Obstacles Posed by\nMiranda, 84 Minn. L. Rev. 397 (1999). With a time limit as short as 14\ndays, police who hope that they can eventually extract a confession may\nfeel comfortable releasing a suspect for a short period of time. The\nresulting delay will only increase the compelling pressures on the\nsuspect.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnot apparent why that is the case. The answer, we are\ntold, is that once a suspect has been out of Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody for 14 days, \u201c[h]e has likely been able to seek advice\nfrom an attorney, family members, and friends.\u201d Ante, at\n8. This speculation, however, is overconfident and only\nquestionably relevant. As a factual matter, we do not\nknow whether the defendant has been able to seek advice:\nFirst of all, suspects are told that if they cannot afford a\nlawyer, one will be provided for them. Yet under the\nmajority\u2019s rule, an indigent suspect who took the police at\ntheir word when he asked for a lawyer will nonetheless be\nassumed to have \u201cbeen able to seek advice from an attor\u00ad\nney.\u201d Second, even suspects who are not indigent cannot\nnecessarily access legal advice (or social advice as the\nCourt presumes) within 14 days. Third, suspects may not\nrealize that they need to seek advice from an attorney.\nUnless police warn suspects that the interrogation will\nresume in 14 days, why contact a lawyer? When a suspect\nis let go, he may assume that the police were satisfied. In\nany event, it is not apparent why interim advice matters.11\nIn Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990), we\nheld that it is not sufficient that a detainee happened to\nspeak at some point with a lawyer. See ibid. (noting that\n\u201cconsultation with an attorney\u201d does not prevent \u201cpersis\u00ad\ntent attempts by officials to persuade [a suspect] to waive\nhis rights\u201d or shield against the \u201ccoercive pressures that\naccompany custody\u201d). If the actual interim advice of an\nattorney is not sufficient, the hypothetical, interim advice\nof \u201can attorney, family members, and friends,\u201d ante, at 8,\nis not enough.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 It is important to distinguish this from the point that I make above\n\nabout indigent suspects. If the police promise to provide a lawyer and\nnever do so, it sends a message to the suspect that the police have lied\nand that the rights read to him are hollow. But the mere fact that a\nsuspect consulted a lawyer does not itself reduce the compulsion when\npolice reinterrogate him.\n8                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The many problems with the Court\u2019s new rule are exac\u00ad\nerbated in the very situation in this case: a suspect who is\nin prison. Even if, as the Court assumes, a trip to one\u2019s\nhome significantly changes the Edwards calculus, a trip to\none\u2019s prison cell is not the same. A prisoner\u2019s freedom is\nseverely limited, and his entire life remains subject to\ngovernment control. Such an environment is not condu\u00ad\ncive to \u201cshak[ing] off any residual coercive effects of his\nprior custody.\u201d Ante, at 11.12 Nor can a prisoner easily\n\u201cseek advice from an attorney, family members, and\nfriends,\u201d ante, at 8, especially not within 14 days; prison\u00ad\ners are frequently subject to restrictions on communica\u00ad\ntions. Nor, in most cases, can he live comfortably knowing\nthat he cannot be badgered by police; prison is not like a\nnormal situation in which a suspect \u201cis in control, and\nneed only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badg\u00ad\nering.\u201d Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 16). Indeed, for a person whose every move is\ncontrolled by the State, it is likely that \u201chis sense of de\u00ad\npendence on, and trust in, counsel as the guardian of his\ninterests in dealing with government officials intensified.\u201d\nUnited States v. Green, 592 A. 2d 985, 989 (D. C. 1991); cf.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 153 (explaining that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged\u201d).13 The Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Cf. Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 326 (1969) (holding that a sus\u00ad\n\npect was in custody while being held in own home, despite his comfort\nand familiarity with the surroundings); Mathis v. United States, 391\nU. S. 1, 5 (1968) (holding that a person serving a prison sentence for\none crime was in custody when he was interrogated in prison about\nanother, unrelated crime); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 478\n(1966) (\u201c[W]hen an individual is . . . deprived of his freedom by the\nauthorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the\nprivilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized\u201d).\n   13 Prison also presents a troubling set of incentives for police. First,\n\nbecause investigators know that their suspect is also a prisoner, there\nis no need formally to place him under arrest. Thus, police generally\ncan interview prisoners even without probable cause to hold them.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nignores these realities of prison, and instead rests its\nargument on the supposition that a prisoner\u2019s \u201cdetention\n. . . is relatively disconnected from their prior unwilling\u00ad\nness to cooperate in an investigation.\u201d Ante, at 14. But\nthat is not necessarily the case. Prisoners are uniquely\nvulnerable to the officials who control every aspect of their\nlives; prison guards may not look kindly upon a prisoner\nwho refuses to cooperate with police. And cooperation\nfrequently is relevant to whether the prisoner can obtain\nparole. See, e.g., Code of Md. Regs., tit. 12, \u00a708.01.18(A)(3)\n(2008). Moreover, even if it is true as a factual matter\nthat a prisoner\u2019s fate is not controlled by the police who\ncome to interrogate him, how is the prisoner supposed to\nknow that? As the Court itself admits, compulsion is\nlikely when a suspect\u2019s \u201ccaptors appear to control [his]\nfate,\u201d ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nwhen a guard informs a suspect that he must go speak\nwith police, it will \u201cappear\u201d to the prisoner that the guard\nand police are not independent. \u201cQuestioning by captors,\nwho appear to control the suspect\u2019s fate, may create mutu\u00ad\nally reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will\nweaken the suspect\u2019s will.\u201d Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S.\n292, 297 (1990) (emphasis added).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis means that police can interrogate suspects with little or no evi\u00ad\ndence of guilt, and police can do so time after time, without fear of\nbeing sued for wrongful arrest. Second, because police know that their\nsuspect is otherwise detained, there is no need necessarily to resolve\nthe case quickly. Police can comfortably bide their time, interrogating\nand reinterrogating their suspect until he slips up. Third, because\npolice need not hold their suspect, they do not need to arraign him or\notherwise initiate formal legal proceedings that would trigger various\nprotections.\n   14 The Court attempts to distinguish detention in prison from the\n\n\u201cparadigm Edwards case,\u201d ante, at 7, but it is not clear why that is so.\nThe difference cannot be simply that convicted prisoners\u2019 \u201cdetention . . .\nis relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in\nan investigation,\u201d ante, at 14, because in many instances of pretrial\n10                     MARYLAND v. SHATZER \n\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                             III \n\n  Because, at the very least, we do not know whether\nShatzer could obtain a lawyer, and thus would have felt\nthat police had lied about providing one, I cannot join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. I concur in today\u2019s judgment, however, on\nanother ground: Even if Shatzer could not consult a law\u00ad\nyer and the police never provided him one, the 2\u00bd-year\nbreak in custody is a basis for treating the second interro\u00ad\ngation as no more coercive than the first. Neither a break\nin custody nor the passage of time has an inherent, cura\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncustody, the custody will continue regardless of whether a detainee\nanswers questions. Take Roberson for example. Roberson was arrested\nand being held for one crime when, days later, a different officer inter\u00ad\nrogated him about a different crime. 486 U. S., at 678. Regardless of\nwhether he cooperated with the second investigation, he was still being\nheld for the first crime. Yet under the Court\u2019s analysis, had Roberson\nbeen held long enough that he had become \u201caccustomed\u201d to the deten\u00ad\ntion facility, ante, at 14, there would have been a break in custody\nbetween each interrogation. Thus, despite the fact that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick, 498 U. S., at\n153, the real problem in Roberson may have been that the police did not\nleave him sitting in jail for long enough.\n   This problem of pretrial custody also highlights a tension with the\nCourt\u2019s decision last Term in Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009). In Montejo, the Court overturned Michigan v. Jackson, 475\nU. S. 625, 636 (1986), which had protected an accused\u2019s Sixth Amend\u00ad\nment right to counsel by \u201cforbidding police to initiate interrogation of a\ncriminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or\nsimilar proceeding.\u201d 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). In so doing, the\nCourt emphasized that because the Edwards \u201cregime suffices to protect\nthe integrity of \u2018a suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his\nlawyer\u2019s presence,\u2019 before his arraignment, it is hard to see why it\nwould not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment.\u201d\n556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162,\n175 (2001) (KENNEDY, J., concurring); citation omitted). But typically,\nafter arraignment, defendants are released on bail or placed in deten\u00ad\ntion facilities, both of which, according to the majority\u2019s logic, some\u00ad\ntimes constitute breaks in custody. How then, under the Court\u2019s\ndecision today, will Edwards serve the role that the Court placed on it\nin Montejo?\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntive power. But certain things change over time. An\nindigent suspect who took police at their word that they\nwould provide an attorney probably will feel that he has\n\u201cbeen denied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d\nRoberson, 486 U. S., at 686, when police begin to question\nhim, without a lawyer, only 14 days later.15 But, when a\nsuspect has been left alone for a significant period of time,\nhe is not as likely to draw such conclusions when the\npolice interrogate him again.16 It is concededly \u201cimpossi\u00ad\nble to determine with precision\u201d where to draw such a line.\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 521 (1972). In the case\nbefore us, however, the suspect was returned to the gen\u00ad\neral prison population for 2\u00bd years. I am convinced that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The Court responds that \u201c[i]f confidence in the police\u2019s promise to\n\nprovide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards would not have applied\nin Minnick, where the suspect in continuing custody actually met with\nappointed counsel.\u201d Ante, at 17\u201318. But my view is not that \u201cconfi\u00ad\ndence in the police\u2019s promise to provide counsel\u201d is \u201cthe touchtone.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. Rather, my view is that although an appropriate break in\ncustody will mitigate many of the reasons that custodial reinterrogation\nof a suspect who requested counsel is inherently compelling, it will not\nmitigate the effect of an indigent detainee believing that he has \u201cbeen\ndenied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at\n686. If police tell an indigent suspect that he is not required to speak\nwithout an attorney, and that they will provide him with an attorney,\nand that suspect asserts his right to an attorney, but police nonetheless\ndo not provide an attorney and reinterrogate him (even if there was a\nbreak in custody between the interrogations), the indigent suspect is\nlikely to feel that the police lied to him or are ignoring his rights. This\nview is not in tension with Minnick. Minnick holds only that consulta\u00ad\ntion with an attorney between interrogations is not sufficient to end the\nEdwards presumption and therefore that when there has been no break\nin custody, \u201ccounsel\u2019s presence at interrogation,\u201d 498 U. S., at 152, is\nnecessary to address the compulsion with which the Edwards line of\ncases is concerned.\n    16 I do not doubt that some of the compulsion caused by reinterrogat\u00ad\n\ning an indigent suspect without providing a lawyer may survive even a\nbreak in custody and a very long passage of time. The relevant point\nhere is more limited: A long break in time, far longer than 14 days,\ndiminishes, rather than eliminates, that compulsion.\n12                MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthis period of time is sufficient. I therefore concur in the\njudgment.\n",

SHATZER\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND\n\n   No. 08\u2013680.      Argued October 5, 2009\u2014Decided February 24, 2010\nIn 2003, a police detective tried to question respondent Shatzer, who\n  was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction,\n  about allegations that he had sexually abused his son. Shatzer in\n  voked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interroga\n  tion, so the detective terminated the interview. Shatzer was released\n  back into the general prison population, and the investigation was\n  closed. Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and at\n  tempted to interrogate Shatzer, who was still incarcerated. Shatzer\n  waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements. The\n  trial court refused to suppress those statements, reasoning that Ed\n  wards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, did not apply because Shatzer had\n  experienced a break in Miranda custody prior to the 2006 interroga\n  tion. Shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse. The Court of Ap\n  peals of Maryland reversed, holding that the mere passage of time\n  does not end the Edwards protections, and that, assuming, arguendo,\n  a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed, Shatzer\u2019s release\n  back into the general prison population did not constitute such a\n  break.\nHeld: Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting\n more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at inter\n rogation, Edwards does not mandate suppression of his 2006 state\n ments. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the\n Miranda right to the presence of counsel, any waiver of that right in\n response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is\n involuntary. Edwards\u2019 fundamental purpose is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the\n integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only\n through counsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291, by \u201cpre\n vent[ing] police from badgering [him] into waiving his previously as\n2                        MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    serted Miranda rights,\u201d Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350. It is\n    easy to believe that a suspect\u2019s later waiver was coerced or badgered\n    when he has been held in uninterrupted Miranda custody since his\n    first refusal to waive. He remains cut off from his normal life and\n    isolated in a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n    U. S. 436, 456, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d Illi\n    nois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297. But where a suspect has been re\n    leased from custody and returned to his normal life for some time be\n    fore the later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to think\n    that his change of heart has been coerced. Because the Edwards pre\n    sumption has been established by opinion of this Court, it is appro\n    priate for this Court to specify the period of release from custody that\n    will terminate its application. See County of Riverside v. McLaugh\n    lin, 500 U. S. 44. The Court concludes that the appropriate period is\n    14 days, which provides ample time for the suspect to get reaccli\n    mated to his normal life, consult with friends and counsel, and shake\n    off any residual coercive effects of prior custody. Pp. 4\u201313.\n       (b) Shatzer\u2019s release back into the general prison population consti\n    tutes a break in Miranda custody. Lawful imprisonment imposed\n    upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by\n    investigative custody that justify Edwards. When previously incar\n    cerated suspects are released back into the general prison population,\n    they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014\n    they regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the\n    attempted interrogation. Their continued detention is relatively dis\n    connected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investiga\n    tion. The \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation\n    ended when Shatzer returned to his normal life.

S. 477 (1981).\n                             I\n  In August 2003, a social worker assigned to the Child\nAdvocacy Center in the Criminal Investigation Division of\nthe Hagerstown Police Department referred to the de\u00ad\npartment allegations that respondent Michael Shatzer,\nSr., had sexually abused his 3-year-old son. At that time,\nShatzer was incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional\nInstitution-Hagerstown, serving a sentence for an unre\u00ad\nlated child-sexual-abuse offense. Detective Shane Blank\u00ad\nenship was assigned to the investigation and interviewed\nShatzer at the correctional institution on August 7, 2003.\nBefore asking any questions, Blankenship reviewed\nShatzer\u2019s Miranda rights with him, and obtained a writ\u00ad\nten waiver of those rights. When Blankenship explained\nthat he was there to question Shatzer about sexually\nabusing his son, Shatzer expressed confusion\u2014he had\nthought Blankenship was an attorney there to discuss the\n2                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprior crime for which he was incarcerated. Blankenship\nclarified the purpose of his visit, and Shatzer declined to\nspeak without an attorney. Accordingly, Blankenship\nended the interview, and Shatzer was released back into\nthe general prison population.          Shortly thereafter,\nBlankenship closed the investigation.\n   Two years and six months later, the same social worker\nreferred more specific allegations to the department about\nthe same incident involving Shatzer. Detective Paul\nHoover, from the same division, was assigned to the inves\u00ad\ntigation. He and the social worker interviewed the victim,\nthen eight years old, who described the incident in more\ndetail. With this new information in hand, on March 2,\n2006, they went to the Roxbury Correctional Institute, to\nwhich Shatzer had since been transferred, and inter\u00ad\nviewed Shatzer in a maintenance room outfitted with a\ndesk and three chairs. Hoover explained that he wanted\nto ask Shatzer about the alleged incident involving\nShatzer\u2019s son. Shatzer was surprised because he thought\nthat the investigation had been closed, but Hoover ex\u00ad\nplained they had opened a new file. Hoover then read\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtained a written waiver\non a standard department form.\n   Hoover interrogated Shatzer about the incident for\napproximately 30 minutes. Shatzer denied ordering his\nson to perform fellatio on him, but admitted to masturbat\u00ad\ning in front of his son from a distance of less than three\nfeet. Before the interview ended, Shatzer agreed to Hoo\u00ad\nver\u2019s request that he submit to a polygraph examination.\nAt no point during the interrogation did Shatzer request\nto speak with an attorney or refer to his prior refusal to\nanswer questions without one.\n   Five days later, on March 7, 2006, Hoover and another\ndetective met with Shatzer at the correctional facility to\nadminister the polygraph examination. After reading\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtaining a written\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

When the detectives\nthen questioned Shatzer, he became upset, started to cry,\nand incriminated himself by saying, \u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t force him.

After making this inculpatory statement, Shatzer\nrequested an attorney, and Hoover promptly ended the\ninterrogation.\n   The State\u2019s Attorney for Washington County charged\nShatzer with second-degree sexual offense, sexual child\nabuse, second-degree assault, and contributing to condi\u00ad\ntions rendering a child in need of assistance. Shatzer\nmoved to suppress his March 2006 statements pursuant to\nEdwards. The trial court held a suppression hearing and\nlater denied Shatzer\u2019s motion. The Edwards protections\ndid not apply, it reasoned, because Shatzer had experi\u00ad\nenced a break in custody for Miranda purposes between\nthe 2003 and 2006 interrogations.

In accordance with the agreement, the\nState described the interview with the victim and\nShatzer\u2019s 2006 statements to the detectives. Based on the\nproffered testimony of the victim and the \u201cadmission of the\ndefendant as to the act of masturbation,\u201d the trial court\nfound Shatzer guilty of sexual child abuse of his son.1 No.\n21\u2013K\u201306\u201337799 (Cir.

SHATZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntections afforded by Edwards,\u201d and that, assuming, ar\nguendo, a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed,\nShatzer\u2019s release back into the general prison population\nbetween interrogations did not constitute a break in cus\u00ad\ntody. 405 Md., at 606\u2013607, 954 A. 2d, at 1131. We\ngranted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n   The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the States by\nvirtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan,\n378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964), provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall\nbe compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. In Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted a set of prophylac\u00ad\ntic measures to protect a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment right\nfrom the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial\ninterrogation. Id., at 467. The Court observed that \u201cin\u00ad\ncommunicado interrogation\u201d in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d \u201cpolice\u00ad\ndominated atmosphere,\u201d id., at 456\u2013457, involves psycho\u00ad\nlogical pressures \u201cwhich work to undermine the individ\u00ad\nual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he\nwould not otherwise do so freely,\u201d id., at 467. Conse\u00ad\nquently, it reasoned, \u201c[u]nless adequate protective devices\nare employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custo\u00ad\ndial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defen\u00ad\ndant can truly be the product of his free choice.\u201d Id., at\n458.\n   To counteract the coercive pressure, Miranda an\u00ad\nnounced that police officers must warn a suspect prior to\nquestioning that he has a right to remain silent, and a\nright to the presence of an attorney. Id., at 444. After the\nwarnings are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes\nto remain silent, the interrogation must cease. Id., at\n473\u2013474. Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an\nattorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is\npresent. Id., at 474. Critically, however, a suspect can\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwaive these rights. Id., at 475. To establish a valid\nwaiver, the State must show that the waiver was knowing,\nintelligent, and voluntary under the \u201chigh standar[d] of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in]\nJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).\u201d Id., at 475.\n   In Edwards, the Court determined that Zerbst\u2019s tradi\u00ad\ntional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a\nsuspect\u2019s right to have counsel present at a subsequent\ninterrogation if he had previously requested counsel;\n\u201cadditional safeguards\u201d were necessary. 451 U. S., at 484.\nThe Court therefore superimposed a \u201csecond layer of\nprophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176\n(1991). Edwards held:\n    \u201c[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have\n    counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid\n    waiver of that right cannot be established by showing\n    only that he responded to further police-initiated cus\u00ad\n    todial interrogation even if he has been advised of his\n    rights. . . . [He] is not subject to further interrogation\n    by the authorities until counsel has been made avail\u00ad\n    able to him, unless the accused himself initiates fur\u00ad\n    ther communication, exchanges, or conversations with\n    the police.\u201d 451 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\nThe rationale of Edwards is that once a suspect indicates\nthat \u201che is not capable of undergoing [custodial] question\u00ad\ning without advice of counsel,\u201d \u201cany subsequent waiver\nthat has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the\nsuspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of the \u2018in\u00ad\nherently compelling pressures\u2019 and not the purely volun\u00ad\ntary choice of the suspect.\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.\n675, 681 (1988). Under this rule, a voluntary Miranda\nwaiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted\ninterrogation to protect a suspect\u2019s right to have counsel\npresent, but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent\nattempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of\n6                  MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the\nsubsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly\ngreater risk of coercion. That increased risk results not\nonly from the police\u2019s persistence in trying to get the sus\u00ad\npect to talk, but also from the continued pressure that\nbegins when the individual is taken into custody as a\nsuspect and sought to be interrogated\u2014pressure likely to\n\u201cincrease as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick v. Mississippi,\n498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990). The Edwards presumption of\ninvoluntariness ensures that police will not take advan\u00ad\ntage of the mounting coercive pressures of \u201cprolonged\npolice custody,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, by repeatedly\nattempting to question a suspect who previously requested\ncounsel until the suspect is \u201cbadgered into submission,\u201d\nid., at 690 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   We have frequently emphasized that the Edwards rule\nis not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed\nprophylaxis. See, e.g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 7\u20138); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S.\n344, 349 (1990); Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, 644, n. 4\n(1984). Because Edwards is \u201cour rule, not a constitutional\ncommand,\u201d \u201cit is our obligation to justify its expansion.\u201d\nRoberson, supra, at 688 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Lower\ncourts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends\nthe Edwards presumption, see, e.g., People v. Storm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519785\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519785/people-v-storm/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023\u20131024, and n. 6, 52 P. 3d 52, 61\u201362,\nand n. 6 (2002) (collecting state and federal cases), but we\nhave previously addressed the issue only in dicta, see\nMcNeil, supra, at 177 (Edwards applies \u201cassuming there\nhas been no break in custody\u201d).\n   A judicially crafted rule is \u201cjustified only by reference to\nits prophylactic purpose,\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S.\n452, 458 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\napplies only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Montejo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). We begin with the benefits.\nEdwards\u2019 presumption of involuntariness has the inciden\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntal effect of \u201cconserv[ing] judicial resources which would\notherwise be expended in making difficult determinations\nof voluntariness.\u201d Minnick, supra, at 151. Its fundamen\u00ad\ntal purpose, however, is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the integrity of an\naccused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through\ncounsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988), by\n\u201cprevent[ing] police from badgering a defendant into waiv\u00ad\ning his previously asserted Miranda rights,\u201d Harvey,\nsupra, at 350. Thus, the benefits of the rule are measured\nby the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that\notherwise would have been admitted. See Montejo, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   It is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or\nbadgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be ques\u00ad\ntioned without counsel in the paradigm Edwards case.\nThat is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a\nparticular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial\ncustody while that crime is being actively investigated.\nAfter the initial interrogation, and up to and including the\nsecond one, he remains cut off from his normal life and\ncompanions, \u201cthrust into\u201d and isolated in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d\n\u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at\n456\u2013457, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d\nIllinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297 (1990). That was the\nsituation confronted by the suspects in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, the three cases in which we have\nheld the Edwards rule applicable. Edwards was arrested\npursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where\nhe was interrogated until he requested counsel. Edwards,\n451 U. S., at 478\u2013479. The officer ended the interrogation\nand took him to the county jail,2 but at 9:15 the next\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Jail is a \u201clocal government\u2019s detention center where persons await\u00ad\ning trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 910 (9th ed. 2009). Prison, by contrast, is a \u201cstate or federal\nfacility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp. felons.\u201d Id., at 1314.\n8                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmorning, two of the officer\u2019s colleagues reinterrogated\nEdwards at the jail. Id., at 479. Roberson was arrested\n\u201cat the scene of a just-completed burglary\u201d and interro\u00ad\ngated there until he requested a lawyer. Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 678. A different officer interrogated him three\ndays later while he \u201cwas still in custody pursuant to the\narrest.\u201d Ibid. Minnick was arrested by local police and\ntaken to the San Diego jail, where two FBI agents interro\u00ad\ngated him the next morning until he requested counsel.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 148\u2013149. Two days later a Missis\u00ad\nsippi Deputy Sheriff reinterrogated him at the jail. Id., at\n149. None of these suspects regained a sense of control or\nnormalcy after they were initially taken into custody for\nthe crime under investigation.\n   When, unlike what happened in these three cases, a\nsuspect has been released from his pretrial custody and\nhas returned to his normal life for some time before the\nlater attempted interrogation, there is little reason to\nthink that his change of heart regarding interrogation\nwithout counsel has been coerced. He has no longer been\nisolated. He has likely been able to seek advice from an\nattorney, family members, and friends.3 And he knows\nfrom his earlier experience that he need only demand\ncounsel to bring the interrogation to a halt; and that in\u00ad\nvestigative custody does not last indefinitely. In these\ncircumstances, it is far fetched to think that a police offi\u00ad\ncer\u2019s asking the suspect whether he would like to waive\nhis Miranda rights will any more \u201cwear down the ac\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 JUSTICESTEVENS points out, post, at 7 (opinion concurring in judg\u00ad\nment), that in Minnick, actual pre-reinterrogation consultation with an\nattorney during continued custody did not suffice to avoid application of\nEdwards. That does not mean that the ability to consult freely with\nattorneys and others does not reduce the level of coercion at all, or that\nit is \u201conly questionably relevant,\u201d post, at 7, to whether termination of\ncustody reduces the coercive pressure that is the basis for Edwards\u2019\nsuper-prophylactic rule.\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncused,\u201d Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98 (1984) (per cu\nriam), than did the first such request at the original at\u00ad\ntempted interrogation\u2014which is of course not deemed\ncoercive. His change of heart is less likely attributable to\n\u201cbadgering\u201d than it is to the fact that further deliberation\nin familiar surroundings has caused him to believe\n(rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with the investiga\u00ad\ntion is in his interest. Uncritical extension of Edwards to\nthis situation would not significantly increase the number\nof genuinely coerced confessions excluded. The \u201cjustifica\u00ad\ntion for a conclusive presumption disappears when appli\u00ad\ncation of the presumption will not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n737 (1991).\n   At the same time that extending the Edwards rule\nyields diminished benefits, extending the rule also in\u00ad\ncreases its costs: the in-fact voluntary confessions it ex\u00ad\ncludes from trial, and the voluntary confessions it deters\nlaw enforcement officers from even trying to obtain. Vol\u00ad\nuntary confessions are not merely \u201ca proper element in\nlaw enforcement,\u201d Miranda, supra, at 478, they are an\n\u201cunmitigated good,\u201d McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181, \u201c \u2018essential\nto society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and\npunishing those who violate the law,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).\n   The only logical endpoint of Edwards disability is ter\u00ad\nmination of Miranda custody and any of its lingering\neffects. Without that limitation\u2014and barring some purely\narbitrary time-limit4\u2014every Edwards prohibition of cus\u00ad\ntodial interrogation of a particular suspect would be eter\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  State\u2019s alternative argument in the present case is that the\nsubstantial lapse in time between the 2003 and 2006 attempts at\ninterrogation independently ended the Edwards presumption. Our\ndisposition makes it unnecessary to address that argument.\n10                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal. The prohibition applies, of course, when the subse\u00ad\nquent interrogation pertains to a different crime,\nRoberson, supra, when it is conducted by a different law\nenforcement authority, Minnick, 498 U. S. 146, and even\nwhen the suspect has met with an attorney after the first\ninterrogation, ibid. And it not only prevents questioning\nex ante; it would render invalid ex post, confessions invited\nand obtained from suspects who (unbeknownst to the\ninterrogators) have acquired Edwards immunity previ\u00ad\nously in connection with any offense in any jurisdiction.5\nIn a country that harbors a large number of repeat offend\u00ad\ners,6 this consequence is disastrous.\n  We conclude that such an extension of Edwards is not\njustified; we have opened its \u201cprotective umbrella,\u201d Solem,\n465 U. S., at 644, n. 4, far enough. The protections offered\nby Miranda, which we have deemed sufficient to ensure\nthat the police respect the suspect\u2019s desire to have an\nattorney present the first time police interrogate him,\nadequately ensure that result when a suspect who initially\nrequested counsel is reinterrogated after a break in cus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 This assumes that Roberson\u2019s extension of Edwards to subsequent\n\ninterrogation for a different crime, and Minnick\u2019s extension of Edwards\nto subsequent interrogation by a different law enforcement agency\nwould apply even when the place of custody and the identity of the\ncustodial agency are not the same (as they were in Roberson and\nMinnick) as those of the original interrogation. That assumption would\nseem reasonable if the Edwards-suspending effect of a termination of\ncustody is rejected. Reinterrogation in different custody or by a differ\u00ad\nent interrogating agency would seem, if anything, less likely than\ntermination of custody to reduce coercive pressures. At the original\nsite, and with respect to the original interrogating agency, the suspect\nhas already experienced cessation of interrogation when he demands\ncounsel\u2014which he may have no reason to expect elsewhere.\n   6 According to a recent study, 67.5% of prisoners released from 15\n\nStates in 1994 were rearrested within three years. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report, Recidivism of Prisoners\nReleased in 1994 (NCJ 193427, 2002).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive\neffects.\n  If Shatzer\u2019s return to the general prison population\nqualified as a break in custody (a question we address in\nPart III, infra), there is no doubt that it lasted long\nenough (2\u00bd years) to meet that durational requirement.\nBut what about a break that has lasted only one year? Or\nonly one week? It is impractical to leave the answer to\nthat question for clarification in future case-by-case adju\u00ad\ndication; law enforcement officers need to know, with\ncertainty and beforehand, when renewed interrogation is\nlawful. And while it is certainly unusual for this Court to\nset forth precise time limits governing police action, it is\nnot unheard-of. In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n500 U. S. 44 (1991), we specified 48 hours as the time\nwithin which the police must comply with the requirement\nof Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), that a person\narrested without a warrant be brought before a magistrate\nto establish probable cause for continued detention.\n  Like McLaughlin, this is a case in which the requisite\npolice action (there, presentation to a magistrate; here,\nabstention from further interrogation) has not been pre\u00ad\nscribed by statute but has been established by opinion of\nthis Court. We think it appropriate to specify a period of\ntime to avoid the consequence that continuation of the\nEdwards presumption \u201cwill not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman, supra, at 737. It seems to us\nthat period is 14 days. That provides plenty of time for\nthe suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to con\u00ad\nsult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any resid\u00ad\nual coercive effects of his prior custody.\n  The 14-day limitation meets Shatzer\u2019s concern that a\nbreak-in-custody rule lends itself to police abuse. He\nenvisions that once a suspect invokes his Miranda right to\ncounsel, the police will release the suspect briefly (to end\nthe Edwards presumption) and then promptly bring him\n12                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nback into custody for reinterrogation. But once the sus\u00ad\npect has been out of custody long enough (14 days) to\neliminate its coercive effect, there will be nothing to gain\nby such gamesmanship\u2014nothing, that is, except the en\u00ad\ntirely appropriate gain of being able to interrogate a sus\u00ad\npect who has made a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.7\n   Shatzer argues that ending the Edwards protections at\na break in custody will undermine Edwards\u2019 purpose to\nconserve judicial resources. To be sure, we have said that\n\u201c[t]he merit of the Edwards decision lies in the clarity of\nits command and the certainty of its application.\u201d\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 151. But clarity and certainty are\nnot goals in themselves. They are valuable only when\nthey reasonably further the achievement of some substan\u00ad\ntive end\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions.\nConfessions obtained after a 2-week break in custody and\na waiver of Miranda rights are most unlikely to be com\u00ad\npelled, and hence are unreasonably excluded. In any case,\na break-in-custody exception will dim only marginally, if\nat all, the bright-line nature of Edwards. In every case\ninvolving Edwards, the courts must determine whether\nthe suspect was in custody when he requested counsel and\nwhen he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.\nNow, in cases where there is an alleged break in custody,\nthey simply have to repeat the inquiry for the time be\u00ad\ntween the initial invocation and reinterrogation. In most\ncases that determination will be easy. And when it is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A defendant who experiences a 14-day break in custody after invok\u00ad\n\ning the Miranda right to counsel is not left without protection. Ed\nwards establishes a presumption that a suspect\u2019s waiver of Miranda\nrights is involuntary. See Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 681\n(1988). Even without this \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), a defendant is still free to claim\nthe prophylactic protection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of\nMiranda rights was in fact involuntary under Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938). See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

No\none questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda\npurposes during the interviews with Detective\nBlankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006. Like\u00ad\nwise, no one questions that Shatzer triggered the Edwards\nprotections when, according to Detective Blankenship\u2019s\nnotes of the 2003 interview, he stated that \u201c \u2018he would not\ntalk about this case without having an attorney present,\u2019 \u201d\n405 Md., at 589, 954 A. 2d, at 1120. After the 2003 inter\u00ad\nview, Shatzer was released back into the general prison\npopulation where he was serving an unrelated sentence.\nThe issue is whether that constitutes a break in Miranda\ncustody.\n  We have never decided whether incarceration consti\u00ad\ntutes custody for Miranda purposes, and have indeed\nexplicitly declined to address the issue. See Perkins, 496\nU. S., at 299. See also Bradley v. Ohio, 497 U. S. 1011,\n1013 (1990) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). Whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the\ncoercive pressure that Miranda was designed to guard\nagainst\u2014the \u201cdanger of coercion [that] results from the\ninteraction of custody and official interrogation.\u201d Perkins,\nsupra, at 297 (emphasis added). To determine whether a\nsuspect was in Miranda custody we have asked whether\n\u201cthere is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of move\u00ad\nment\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d New\nYork v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984); see also Stans\nbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam).\nThis test, no doubt, is satisfied by all forms of incarcera\u00ad\n14                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion. Our cases make clear, however, that the freedom-of\u00ad\nmovement test identifies only a necessary and not a suffi\u00ad\ncient condition for Miranda custody. We have declined to\naccord it \u201ctalismanic power,\u201d because Miranda is to be\nenforced \u201conly in those types of situations in which the\nconcerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d\nBerkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, the\ntemporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in\u00ad\nvolved in a traffic stop or Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968), does not constitute Miranda custody.\nMcCarty, supra, at 439\u2013440. See also Perkins, supra, at\n296.\n   Here, we are addressing the interim period during\nwhich a suspect was not interrogated, but was subject to a\nbaseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior\nconviction. Without minimizing the harsh realities of\nincarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed\nupon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive\npressures identified in Miranda.\n   Interrogated suspects who have previously been con\u00ad\nvicted of crime live in prison. When they are released\nback into the general prison population, they return to\ntheir accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014they\nregain the degree of control they had over their lives prior\nto the interrogation. Sentenced prisoners, in contrast to\nthe Miranda paradigm, are not isolated with their accus\u00ad\ners. They live among other inmates, guards, and workers,\nand often can receive visitors and communicate with\npeople on the outside by mail or telephone.\n   Their detention, moreover, is relatively disconnected\nfrom their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investi\u00ad\ngation. The former interrogator has no power to increase\nthe duration of incarceration, which was determined at\nsentencing.8 And even where the possibility of parole\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 We   distinguish the duration of incarceration from the duration of\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nexists, the former interrogator has no apparent power to\ndecrease the time served. This is in stark contrast to the\ncircumstances faced by the defendants in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, whose continued detention as\nsuspects rested with those controlling their interrogation,\nand who confronted the uncertainties of what final\ncharges they would face, whether they would be convicted,\nand what sentence they would receive.\n   Shatzer\u2019s experience illustrates the vast differences\nbetween Miranda custody and incarceration pursuant to\nconviction. At the time of the 2003 attempted interroga\u00ad\ntion, Shatzer was already serving a sentence for a prior\nconviction. After that, he returned to the general prison\npopulation in the Maryland Correctional Institution-\nHagerstown and was later transferred, for unrelated\nreasons, down the street to the Roxbury Correctional\nInstitute. Both are medium-security state correctional\nfacilities. See Maryland Div. of Correction Inmate Hand\u00ad\nbook 7 (2007), online at http://dpscs.md.gov/rehabservs/\ndoc/pdfs/2007_Inmate_Handbook.pdf (all Internet materi\u00ad\nals as visited Feb. 22, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).

When a prisoner is\nremoved from the general prison population and taken to a separate\nlocation for questioning, the duration of that separation is assuredly\ndependent upon his interrogators. For which reason once he has\nasserted a refusal to speak without assistance of counsel Edwards\nprevents any efforts to get him to change his mind during that inter\u00ad\nrogative custody.\n16                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntention after the 2003 interrogation did not depend on\nwhat he said (or did not say) to Detective Blankenship,\nand he has not alleged that he was placed in a higher level\nof security or faced any continuing restraints as a result of\nthe 2003 interrogation. The \u201cinherently compelling pres\u00ad\nsures\u201d of custodial interrogation ended when he returned\nto his normal life.\n                                IV\n  A few words in response to JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 concur\u00ad\nrence: It claims we ignore that \u201c[w]hen police tell an indi\u00ad\ngent suspect that he has the right to an attorney\u201d and\nthen \u201creinterrogate\u201d him without providing a lawyer, \u201cthe\nsuspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that\nhe really does not have any right to a lawyer.\u201d Post, at 2\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (hereinafter concur\u00ad\nrence). See also post, at 4, 7, n. 11, 11, n. 16. The fallacy\nhere is that we are not talking about \u201creinterrogating\u201d the\nsuspect; we are talking about asking his permission to be\ninterrogated. An officer has in no sense lied to a suspect\nwhen, after advising, as Miranda requires, \u201cYou have the\nright to remain silent, and if you choose to speak you have\nthe right to the presence of an attorney,\u201d he promptly ends\nthe attempted interrogation because the suspect declines\nto speak without counsel present, and then, two weeks\nlater, reapproaches the suspect and asks, \u201cAre you now\nwilling to speak without a lawyer present?\u201d\n  The \u201cconcer[n] that motivated the Edwards line of\ncases,\u201d post, at 2\u20133, n. 2, is that the suspect will be coerced\ninto saying yes. That concern guides our decision today.\nContrary to the concurrence\u2019s conclusion, post, at 3, 5\u20136,\nthere is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession\nas \u201c \u2018the only way to end his interrogation\u2019 \u201d when, before\nthe interrogation begins, he is told that he can avoid it by\nsimply requesting that he not be interrogated without\ncounsel present\u2014an option that worked before.

S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcurrence argues will often be the case, post, at 5, a\nbreak in custody does not change the suspect\u2019s mind, he\nneed only say so.\n   The concurrence also accuses the Court of \u201cignor[ing]\nthat when a suspect asks for counsel, until his request is\nanswered, there are still the same \u2018inherently compelling\u2019\npressures of custodial interrogation on which the Miranda\nline of cases is based.\u201d Post, at 4. We do not ignore these\npressures; nor do we suggest that they disappear when\ncustody is recommenced after a break, see post, at 5. But\nif those pressures are merely \u201cthe same\u201d as before, then\nMiranda provides sufficient protection\u2014as it did before.\nThe Edwards presumption of involuntariness is justified\nonly in circumstances where the coercive pressures have\nincreased so much that suspects\u2019 waivers of Miranda\nrights are likely to be involuntary most of the time. Con\u00ad\ntrary to the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, post, at 3, it is only\nin those narrow circumstances\u2014when custody is unbro\u00ad\nken\u2014that the Court has concluded a \u201cfresh se[t] of\nMiranda warnings\u201d is not sufficient. See Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 686.\n   In the last analysis, it turns out that the concurrence\naccepts our principal points. It agrees that Edwards\nprophylaxis is not perpetual; it agrees that a break in\ncustody reduces the inherently compelling pressure upon\nwhich Edwards was based; it agrees that Shatzer\u2019s release\nback into the general prison population constituted a\nbreak in custody; and it agrees that in this case the break\nwas long enough to render Edwards inapplicable. Post, at\n10\u201312. We differ in two respects: Instead of terminating\nEdwards protection when the custodial pressures that\nwere the basis for that protection dissipate, the concur\u00ad\nrence would terminate it when the suspect would no\nlonger \u201cfeel that he has \u2018been denied the counsel he has\nclearly requested,\u2019 \u201d post, at 11. This is entirely unrelated\nto the rationale of Edwards. If confidence in the police\u2019s\n18                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npromise to provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards\nwould not have applied in Minnick, where the suspect in\ncontinuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.\nThe concurrence\u2019s rule is also entirely unrelated to the\nexistence of a break in custody. While that may relieve\nthe accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the\nfoundation for Edwards, it is hard to see how it bolsters\nthe suspect\u2019s confidence that if he asks for counsel he will\nget one.\n   And secondly, the concurrence differs from us in declin\u00ad\ning to say how long after a break in custody the termina\u00ad\ntion of Edwards protection occurs. Two and one-half\nyears, it says, is clearly enough\u2014but it gives law enforce\u00ad\nment authorities no further guidance. The concurrence\ncriticizes our use of 14 days as arbitrary and unexplained,\npost, at 5, and n. 7. But in fact that rests upon the same\nbasis as the concurrence\u2019s own approval of a 21\u20442-year\nbreak in custody: how much time will justify \u201ctreating the\nsecond interrogation as no more coercive than the first,\u201d\npost, at 10. Failure to say where the line falls short of 21\u20442\nyears, and leaving that for future case-by-case determina\u00ad\ntion, is certainly less helpful, but not at all less arbitrary.\n                        *     *     *\n  Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody lasting more than two weeks between the first and\nsecond attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not man\u00ad\ndate suppression of his March 2006 statements. Accord\u00ad\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals of\nMaryland, and remand the case for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

I do not join the Court\u2019s decision to\nextend the presumption of involuntariness established in\nEdwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), for 14 days after\ncustody ends.\n   It is not apparent to me that the presumption of in\nvoluntariness the Court recognized in Edwards is justifi\nable even in the custodial setting to which Edwards ap\nplies it. See, e.g., Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146,\n160 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I would\nnot extend the Edwards rule \u201cbeyond the circumstances\npresent in Edwards itself.\u201d Id., at 162. But even if one\nbelieves that the Court is obliged to apply Edwards to any\ncase involving continuing custody, the Court\u2019s opinion\ntoday goes well beyond that. It extends the presumption\nof involuntariness Edwards applies in custodial settings to\ninterrogations that occur after custody ends.\n   The Court concedes that this extension, like the Ed\nwards presumption itself, is not constitutionally required.\nThe Court nevertheless defends the extension as a judi\ncially created prophylaxis against compelled confessions.\nEven if one accepts that such prophylaxis is both permis\n2                     MARYLAND v.

Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), maintain \u201cthe closest possible fit\u201d\nbetween the rule and the Fifth Amendment interests they\nseek to protect. United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,\n640\u2013641 (2004) (plurality opinion); see generally Montejo\nv. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18);\nChavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 772 (2003) (plurality\nopinion). The Court\u2019s 14-day rule does not satisfy this\ntest. The Court relates its 14-day rule to the Fifth\nAmendment simply by asserting that 14 days between\nrelease and recapture should provide \u201cplenty of time for\nthe suspect . . . to shake off any residual coercive effects of\nhis prior custody,\u201d ante, at 11.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At a minimum the latter proposition is questionable. I concede that\n\nsome police officers might badger a suspect during a subsequent inter\nrogation after a break in custody, or might use catch-and-release tactics\nto suggest they will not take no for an answer. But if a suspect reenters\ncustody after being questioned and released, he need only invoke his\nright to counsel to ensure Edwards\u2019 protection for the duration of the\nsubsequent detention. And, if law enforcement officers repeatedly\nrelease and recapture a suspect to wear down his will\u2014such that his\nparticipation in a subsequent interrogation is no longer truly volun\ntary\u2014the \u201chigh standar[d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional\nrights [set forth in] Johnson v.

The Zerbst inquiry\ntakes into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the\nwaiver\u2014including any improper pressures by police. See id., at 464; cf.\nante, at 11\u201312, n. 6 (stating that \u201c[e]ven without [Edwards\u2019] second\nlayer of prophylaxis, a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic\nprotection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of Miranda rights was\nin fact involuntary under Johnson v.

Nor does it explain how the benefits of a prophy\nlactic 14-day rule (either on its own terms or compared\nwith other possible rules) \u201coutweigh its costs\u201d (which\nwould include the loss of law enforcement information as\nwell as the exclusion of confessions that are in fact volun\ntary). Ante, at 6 (citing Montejo, supra, at __ (slip op., at\n14)).\n   To be sure, the Court\u2019s rule has the benefit of providing\na bright line. Ante, at 12. But bright-line rules are not\nnecessary to prevent Fifth Amendment violations, as the\nCourt has made clear when refusing to adopt such rules in\ncases involving other Miranda rights. See, e.g., Michigan\nv. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103\u2013104 (1975). And an otherwise\narbitrary rule is not justifiable merely because it gives\nclear instruction to law enforcement officers.2\n   As the Court concedes, \u201cclarity and certainty are not\ngoals in themselves. They are valuable only when they\nreasonably further the achievement of some substantive\nend\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions\u201d that\nthe Fifth Amendment prohibits. Ante, at 12. The Court\u2019s\narbitrary 14-day rule fails this test, even under the rela\ntively permissive criteria set forth in our precedents.\nAccordingly, I do not join that portion of the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Though the Court asserts that its 14-day rule will tell \u201claw enforce\n\nment officers . . . with certainty and beforehand, when renewed interro\ngation is lawful,\u201d ante, at 10, that is not so clear. Determining whether\na suspect was previously in custody, and when the suspect was re\nleased, may be difficult without questioning the suspect, especially if\nstate and federal authorities are conducting simultaneous investiga\ntions.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

See Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686. The Court,\nmoreover, ignores that when a suspect asks for counsel,\nuntil his request is answered, there are still the same\n\u201cinherently compelling\u201d pressures of custodial interroga\u00ad\ntion on which the Miranda line of cases is based, see 486\nU. S., at 681,5 and that the concern about compulsion is\nespecially serious for a detainee who has requested a\nlawyer, an act that signals his \u201cinability to cope with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMichael C., 442 U.

Counsel can curb an officer\u2019s\noverbearing conduct, advise a suspect of his rights, and ensure that\nthere is an accurate record of any interrogation. \u201cBecause of this\nspecial ability of the lawyer to help the client preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights once the client becomes enmeshed in the adversary\nprocess, the Court found that the right to have counsel present at the\ninterrogation is indispensible to the protection of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege.\u201d Arizona v.

But its opinion gives\nno strong basis for believing that this is the case.7 A 14\u00ad\nday break in custody does not eliminate the rationale for\nthe initial Edwards rule: The detainee has been told that\nhe may remain silent and speak only through a lawyer\nand that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be pro\u00ad\nvided for him. He has asked for a lawyer. He does not\nhave one. He is in custody. And police are still question\u00ad\ning him. A 14-day break in custody does not change the\nfact that custodial interrogation is inherently compelling.\nIt is unlikely to change the fact that a detainee \u201cconsiders\nhimself unable to deal with the pressures of custodial\ninterrogation without legal assistance.\u201d Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 683.8 And in some instances, a 14-day break in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See  Roberson, 486 U. S., at 681 (\u201c[I]f a suspect believes that he is not\ncapable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then\nit is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the au\u00ad\nthorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the\nproduct of the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 \u201d); Michigan v.

To be sure, it may be difficult to marshal conclusive evidence\nwhen setting an arbitrary time period. But in light of the basis for\nEdwards, we should tread carefully. Instead, the only reason for\nchoosing a 14-day time period, the Court tells us, is that \u201c[i]t seems to\nus that period is 14 days.\u201d Ante, at 11. That time period is \u201cplenty of\ntime for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult\nwith friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects\nof his prior custody.\u201d Ibid. But the Court gives no reason for that\nspeculation, which may well prove inaccurate in many circumstances.\n   8 In Roberson, for example, we observed that once a suspect has as\u00ad\n6                       MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncustody may make matters worse 9 \u201c[w]hen a suspect\nunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored\u201d\nand thus \u201cmay well see further objection as futile and\nconfession (true or not) as the only way to end his interro\u00ad\ngation.\u201d Davis, 512 U. S., at 472\u2013473 (Souter, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment).10\n  The Court ignores these understandings from the Ed\nwards line of cases and instead speculates that if a suspect\nis reinterrogated and eventually talks, it must be that\n\u201cfurther deliberation in familiar surroundings has caused\nhim to believe (rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with\nthe investigation is in his interest.\u201d Ante, at 9. But it is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nserted his right to an attorney, courts must presume he does \u201cnot feel\nsufficiently comfortable with the pressures of custodial interrogation to\nanswer questions without an attorney. This discomfort is precisely the\nstate of mind that Edwards presumes to persist . . . .\u201d 486 U. S., at 684.\nWe held in Roberson that just because different police come to speak\nabout a different investigation, that presumption does not change:\n\u201c[T]here is no reason to assume that a suspect\u2019s state of mind is in any\nway investigation-specific.\u201d Ibid. Nor is there any reason to believe\nthat it is arrest specific.\n    9 The compulsion is heightened by the fact that \u201c[t]he uncertainty of\n\nfate that being released from custody and then reapprehended entails\nis, in some circumstances, more coercive than continual custody.\u201d\nStrauss, Reinterrogation, 22 Hastings Const. L. Q. 359, 390 (1995).\n    10 Not only is this a likely effect of reinterrogation, but police may use\n\nthis effect to their advantage. Indeed, the Court\u2019s rule creates a\nstrange incentive to delay formal proceedings, in order to gain addi\u00ad\ntional information by way of interrogation after the time limit lapses.\nThe justification for Fifth Amendment rules \u201cmust be consistent with\n. . . practical realities,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 688 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting), and the reality is that police may operate within the\nconfines of the Fifth Amendment in order to extract as many confes\u00ad\nsions as possible, see Leo & White, Adapting to Miranda: Modern\nInterrogators\u2019 Strategies for Dealing with the Obstacles Posed by\nMiranda, 84 Minn. L. Rev. 397 (1999). With a time limit as short as 14\ndays, police who hope that they can eventually extract a confession may\nfeel comfortable releasing a suspect for a short period of time. The\nresulting delay will only increase the compelling pressures on the\nsuspect.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnot apparent why that is the case. The answer, we are\ntold, is that once a suspect has been out of Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody for 14 days, \u201c[h]e has likely been able to seek advice\nfrom an attorney, family members, and friends.\u201d Ante, at\n8. This speculation, however, is overconfident and only\nquestionably relevant. As a factual matter, we do not\nknow whether the defendant has been able to seek advice:\nFirst of all, suspects are told that if they cannot afford a\nlawyer, one will be provided for them. Yet under the\nmajority\u2019s rule, an indigent suspect who took the police at\ntheir word when he asked for a lawyer will nonetheless be\nassumed to have \u201cbeen able to seek advice from an attor\u00ad\nney.\u201d Second, even suspects who are not indigent cannot\nnecessarily access legal advice (or social advice as the\nCourt presumes) within 14 days. Third, suspects may not\nrealize that they need to seek advice from an attorney.\nUnless police warn suspects that the interrogation will\nresume in 14 days, why contact a lawyer? When a suspect\nis let go, he may assume that the police were satisfied. In\nany event, it is not apparent why interim advice matters.11\nIn Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990), we\nheld that it is not sufficient that a detainee happened to\nspeak at some point with a lawyer. See ibid. (noting that\n\u201cconsultation with an attorney\u201d does not prevent \u201cpersis\u00ad\ntent attempts by officials to persuade [a suspect] to waive\nhis rights\u201d or shield against the \u201ccoercive pressures that\naccompany custody\u201d). If the actual interim advice of an\nattorney is not sufficient, the hypothetical, interim advice\nof \u201can attorney, family members, and friends,\u201d ante, at 8,\nis not enough.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 It is important to distinguish this from the point that I make above\n\nabout indigent suspects. If the police promise to provide a lawyer and\nnever do so, it sends a message to the suspect that the police have lied\nand that the rights read to him are hollow. But the mere fact that a\nsuspect consulted a lawyer does not itself reduce the compulsion when\npolice reinterrogate him.\n8                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The many problems with the Court\u2019s new rule are exac\u00ad\nerbated in the very situation in this case: a suspect who is\nin prison. Even if, as the Court assumes, a trip to one\u2019s\nhome significantly changes the Edwards calculus, a trip to\none\u2019s prison cell is not the same. A prisoner\u2019s freedom is\nseverely limited, and his entire life remains subject to\ngovernment control. Such an environment is not condu\u00ad\ncive to \u201cshak[ing] off any residual coercive effects of his\nprior custody.\u201d Ante, at 11.12 Nor can a prisoner easily\n\u201cseek advice from an attorney, family members, and\nfriends,\u201d ante, at 8, especially not within 14 days; prison\u00ad\ners are frequently subject to restrictions on communica\u00ad\ntions. Nor, in most cases, can he live comfortably knowing\nthat he cannot be badgered by police; prison is not like a\nnormal situation in which a suspect \u201cis in control, and\nneed only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badg\u00ad\nering.\u201d Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 16). Indeed, for a person whose every move is\ncontrolled by the State, it is likely that \u201chis sense of de\u00ad\npendence on, and trust in, counsel as the guardian of his\ninterests in dealing with government officials intensified.\u201d\nUnited States v. Green, 592 A. 2d 985, 989 (D. C. 1991); cf.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 153 (explaining that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged\u201d).13 The Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Cf. Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 326 (1969) (holding that a sus\u00ad\n\npect was in custody while being held in own home, despite his comfort\nand familiarity with the surroundings); Mathis v. United States, 391\nU. S. 1, 5 (1968) (holding that a person serving a prison sentence for\none crime was in custody when he was interrogated in prison about\nanother, unrelated crime); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.

First,\n\nbecause investigators know that their suspect is also a prisoner, there\nis no need formally to place him under arrest. Thus, police generally\ncan interview prisoners even without probable cause to hold them.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nignores these realities of prison, and instead rests its\nargument on the supposition that a prisoner\u2019s \u201cdetention\n. . . is relatively disconnected from their prior unwilling\u00ad\nness to cooperate in an investigation.\u201d Ante, at 14. But\nthat is not necessarily the case. Prisoners are uniquely\nvulnerable to the officials who control every aspect of their\nlives; prison guards may not look kindly upon a prisoner\nwho refuses to cooperate with police. And cooperation\nfrequently is relevant to whether the prisoner can obtain\nparole. See, e.g., Code of Md. Regs., tit. 12, \u00a708.01.18(A)(3)\n(2008). Moreover, even if it is true as a factual matter\nthat a prisoner\u2019s fate is not controlled by the police who\ncome to interrogate him, how is the prisoner supposed to\nknow that? As the Court itself admits, compulsion is\nlikely when a suspect\u2019s \u201ccaptors appear to control [his]\nfate,\u201d ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nwhen a guard informs a suspect that he must go speak\nwith police, it will \u201cappear\u201d to the prisoner that the guard\nand police are not independent. \u201cQuestioning by captors,\nwho appear to control the suspect\u2019s fate, may create mutu\u00ad\nally reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will\nweaken the suspect\u2019s will.\u201d Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S.\n292, 297 (1990) (emphasis added).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis means that police can interrogate suspects with little or no evi\u00ad\ndence of guilt, and police can do so time after time, without fear of\nbeing sued for wrongful arrest. Second, because police know that their\nsuspect is otherwise detained, there is no need necessarily to resolve\nthe case quickly. Police can comfortably bide their time, interrogating\nand reinterrogating their suspect until he slips up. Third, because\npolice need not hold their suspect, they do not need to arraign him or\notherwise initiate formal legal proceedings that would trigger various\nprotections.\n   14 The Court attempts to distinguish detention in prison from the\n\n\u201cparadigm Edwards case,\u201d ante, at 7, but it is not clear why that is so.\nThe difference cannot be simply that convicted prisoners\u2019 \u201cdetention . . .\nis relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in\nan investigation,\u201d ante, at 14, because in many instances of pretrial\n10                     MARYLAND v. SHATZER \n\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                             III \n\n  Because, at the very least, we do not know whether\nShatzer could obtain a lawyer, and thus would have felt\nthat police had lied about providing one, I cannot join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. I concur in today\u2019s judgment, however, on\nanother ground: Even if Shatzer could not consult a law\u00ad\nyer and the police never provided him one, the 2\u00bd-year\nbreak in custody is a basis for treating the second interro\u00ad\ngation as no more coercive than the first. Neither a break\nin custody nor the passage of time has an inherent, cura\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncustody, the custody will continue regardless of whether a detainee\nanswers questions. Take Roberson for example. Roberson was arrested\nand being held for one crime when, days later, a different officer inter\u00ad\nrogated him about a different crime. 486 U. S., at 678. Regardless of\nwhether he cooperated with the second investigation, he was still being\nheld for the first crime. Yet under the Court\u2019s analysis, had Roberson\nbeen held long enough that he had become \u201caccustomed\u201d to the deten\u00ad\ntion facility, ante, at 14, there would have been a break in custody\nbetween each interrogation. Thus, despite the fact that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick, 498 U. S., at\n153, the real problem in Roberson may have been that the police did not\nleave him sitting in jail for long enough.\n   This problem of pretrial custody also highlights a tension with the\nCourt\u2019s decision last Term in Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009). In Montejo, the Court overturned Michigan v. Jackson, 475\nU. S. 625, 636 (1986), which had protected an accused\u2019s Sixth Amend\u00ad\nment right to counsel by \u201cforbidding police to initiate interrogation of a\ncriminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or\nsimilar proceeding.\u201d 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). In so doing, the\nCourt emphasized that because the Edwards \u201cregime suffices to protect\nthe integrity of \u2018a suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his\nlawyer\u2019s presence,\u2019 before his arraignment, it is hard to see why it\nwould not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment.\u201d\n556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162,\n175 (2001) (KENNEDY, J., concurring); citation omitted). But typically,\nafter arraignment, defendants are released on bail or placed in deten\u00ad\ntion facilities, both of which, according to the majority\u2019s logic, some\u00ad\ntimes constitute breaks in custody. How then, under the Court\u2019s\ndecision today, will Edwards serve the role that the Court placed on it\nin Montejo?\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

An\nindigent suspect who took police at their word that they\nwould provide an attorney probably will feel that he has\n\u201cbeen denied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d\nRoberson, 486 U. S., at 686, when police begin to question\nhim, without a lawyer, only 14 days later.15 But, when a\nsuspect has been left alone for a significant period of time,\nhe is not as likely to draw such conclusions when the\npolice interrogate him again.16 It is concededly \u201cimpossi\u00ad\nble to determine with precision\u201d where to draw such a line.\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 521 (1972). In the case\nbefore us, however, the suspect was returned to the gen\u00ad\neral prison population for 2\u00bd years. I am convinced that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The Court responds that \u201c[i]f confidence in the police\u2019s promise to\n\nprovide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards would not have applied\nin Minnick, where the suspect in continuing custody actually met with\nappointed counsel.\u201d Ante, at 17\u201318. But my view is not that \u201cconfi\u00ad\ndence in the police\u2019s promise to provide counsel\u201d is \u201cthe touchtone.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. Rather, my view is that although an appropriate break in\ncustody will mitigate many of the reasons that custodial reinterrogation\nof a suspect who requested counsel is inherently compelling, it will not\nmitigate the effect of an indigent detainee believing that he has \u201cbeen\ndenied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at\n686. If police tell an indigent suspect that he is not required to speak\nwithout an attorney, and that they will provide him with an attorney,\nand that suspect asserts his right to an attorney, but police nonetheless\ndo not provide an attorney and reinterrogate him (even if there was a\nbreak in custody between the interrogations), the indigent suspect is\nlikely to feel that the police lied to him or are ignoring his rights. This\nview is not in tension with Minnick. Minnick holds only that consulta\u00ad\ntion with an attorney between interrogations is not sufficient to end the\nEdwards presumption and therefore that when there has been no break\nin custody, \u201ccounsel\u2019s presence at interrogation,\u201d 498 U. S., at 152, is\nnecessary to address the compulsion with which the Edwards line of\ncases is concerned.\n    16 I do not doubt that some of the compulsion caused by reinterrogat\u00ad\n\ning an indigent suspect without providing a lawyer may survive even a\nbreak in custody and a very long passage of time. The relevant point\nhere is more limited: A long break in time, far longer than 14 days,\ndiminishes, rather than eliminates, that compulsion.\n12                MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthis period of time is sufficient. I therefore concur in the\njudgment.\n</pre>",
