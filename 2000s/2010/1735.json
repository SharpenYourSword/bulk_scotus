FRIEND ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 08–1107. Argued November 10, 2009––Decided February 23, 2010\nRespondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a\n  California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought\n  removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2),\n  1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif\n  ferent States, §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver\n  sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that\n  Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di\n  versity jurisdiction was lacking under §1332(c)(1), which provides\n  that “a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\n  which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin\n  cipal place of business.” To show that its “principal place of business”\n  was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration\n  stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,\n  that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,\n  that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,\n  and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar\n  ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di\n  versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under\n  Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount\n  of the corporation’s business activity is “significantly larger” or “sub\n  stantially predominates” in one State. Finding that California was\n  Hertz’s “principal place of business” under that test because a plural\n  ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court\n  remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents’ argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under\n §1453(c)—which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as\n the District Court’s only to “court[s] of appeals,” not to the Supreme\n2                        HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court, and provides that if “a final judgment on the appeal” in a court\n    of appeals “is not issued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible\n    10-day extension), “the appeal shall be denied”—makes far too much\n    of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as\n    implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute\n    specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660–661.\n    Here, replicating similar, older statutes, §1254 specifically gives the\n    Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari” cases that\n    are “in the courts of appeals” when it grants the writ. The Court thus\n    interprets §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as simply requiring a\n    court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time—not to\n    deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,\n    e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       2. The phrase “principal place of business” in §1332(c)(1) refers to\n    the place where a corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and\n    coordinate the corporation’s activities, i.e., its “nerve center,” which\n    will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5–19.\n          (a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic\n    tion demonstrates that Congress added §1332(c)(1)’s “principal place\n    of business” language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in\n    order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris\n    diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5–10.\n          (b) However, the phrase “principal place of business” has proved\n    more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After\n    Congress’ amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to\n    determine a corporation’s “principal place of business” for diversity\n    purposes. If a corporation’s headquarters and executive offices were\n    in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed\n    straightforward. The “principal place of business” was in that State.\n    But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were\n    in one State, while the corporation’s plants or other centers of busi\n    ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with “far-flung”\n    business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation’s\n    “nerve center,” from which the corporation radiates out to its con\n    stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi\n    nate the corporation’s activities. However, this test did not go far\n    enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora\n    tion’s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few\n    States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused\n    more heavily on where a corporation’s actual business activities are\n    located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter\n    pret the statute. Pp. 10–13.\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n     (c) In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of\nthe statutory phrase, this Court returns to the “nerve center” ap\nproach: “[P]rincipal place of business” is best read as referring to the\nplace where a corporation’s officers direct, control, and coordinate the\ncorporation’s activities. In practice it should normally be the place\nwhere the corporation maintains its headquarters—provided that the\nheadquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina\ntion, i.e., the “nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpo\nration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13–19.\n        (i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the\nCourt that the “nerve center” approach, while imperfect, is superior\nto other possibilities. First, §1332(c)(1)’s language supports the ap\nproach. The statute’s word “place” is singular, not plural. Its word\n“principal” requires that the main, prominent, or most important\nplace be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,\n174. And the fact that the word “place” follows the words “State\nwhere” means that the “place” is a place within a State, not the State\nitself. A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main headquarters,\nis a single place. The public often considers it the corporation’s main\nplace of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\napplication of a more general business activities test has led some\ncourts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within\na State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total\namount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and\ndetermining whether they are significantly larger than in the next\nranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in\na jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A “nerve\ncenter” approach, which ordinarily equates that “center” with a cor\nporation’s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.\nBy contrast, a corporation’s general business activities more often\nlack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat\nute’s legislative history suggests that the words “principal place of\nbusiness” should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear\nlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical\nto apply. A “nerve center” test offers such a possibility. A general\nbusiness activities test does not. Pp. 14–17.\n        (ii) While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all admin\nistrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under\nthe “nerve center” test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to\napply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets\nor revenues different in kind, one from the other. And though this\ntest may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale\nof diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive re\nsults is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex\n4                       HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that ac\n    company a more uniform legal system. Pp. 17–18.\n         (iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula\n    tion—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is nothing more\n    than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of\n    an annual executive retreat—the courts should instead take as the\n    “nerve center” the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,\n    in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18–19.\n         (d) Although petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that\n    Hertz’s “nerve center” and its corporate headquarters are one and the\n    same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re\n    spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their\n    case in light of today’s holding.

S. C. §1332(c)(1)\n(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter\npretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In\ndoing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi\ncial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as\nsimple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase\n“principal place of business” refers to the place where the\ncorporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordi\nnate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts\nhave often metaphorically called that place the corpora\ntion’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.\nNational Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);\nScot Typewriter Co. v.

We believe that the\n“nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s\nheadquarters.\n2                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and\nJohn Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the\nHertz Corporation, in a California state court. They\nsought damages for what they claimed were violations of\nCalifornia’s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential\nclass composed of California citizens who had allegedly\nsuffered similar harms.\n   Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.\n28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the\nplaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different\nStates. §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court\npossessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and\nNhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a\nCalifornia citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver\nsity jurisdiction was lacking.\n   To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration\nby an employee relations manager that sought to show\nthat Hertz’s “principal place of business” was in New\nJersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among\nother things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;\nand that California—which had about 12% of the Nation’s\npopulation, Pet. for Cert. 8—accounted for 273 of Hertz’s\n1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full\ntime employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in\nannual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately\n21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara\ntion also stated that the “leadership of Hertz and its do\nmestic subsidiaries” is located at Hertz’s “corporate head\nquarters” in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its “core\nexecutive and administrative functions . . . are carried out”\nthere and “to a lesser extent” in Oklahoma City, Okla\nhoma; and that its “major administrative operations . . .\nare found” at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court of the Northern District of California\naccepted Hertz’s statement of the facts as undisputed.\nBut it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi\nzen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court\napplied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to\nidentify a corporation’s “principal place of business” by\nfirst determining the amount of a corporation’s business\nactivity State by State. If the amount of activity is “sig\nnificantly larger” or “substantially predominates” in one\nState, then that State is the corporation’s “principal place\nof business.” If there is no such State, then the “principal\nplace of business” is the corporation’s “ ‘nerve center,’ ” i.e.,\nthe place where “ ‘the majority of its executive and admin\nistrative functions are performed.’ ” Friend v. Hertz, No.\nC–07–5222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf\nter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi\nronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500–502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).\n   Applying this test, the District Court found that the\n“plurality of each of the relevant business activities” was\nin California, and that “the differential between the\namount of those activities” in California and the amount\nin “the next closest state” was “significant.” Order 4.\nHence, Hertz’s “principal place of business” was Califor\nnia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The\nDistrict Court consequently remanded the case to the\nstate courts.\n   Hertz appealed the District Court’s remand order. 28\nU. S. C. §1453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief\nmemorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz\nfiled a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences\namong the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo\nrate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco\nCorp., supra, at 500–502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.\nRussellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap\nplying “total activity” test and looking at “all corporate\nactivities”), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282\n4                   HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(applying “nerve center” test).\n                               II\n   At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.\nRespondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz\nto appeal the District Court’s remand order to the Court of\nAppeals, 28 U. S. C. §1453(c), constitutes an exception to a\nmore general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are\n“not reviewable on appeal.” §1447(d). They add that the\nlanguage of §1453(c) refers only to “court[s] of appeals,”\nnot to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if “a\nfinal judgment on the appeal” in a court of appeals “is not\nissued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible 10-day\nextension), “the appeal shall be denied.” And respondents\ndraw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion\nthat Congress intended to permit review of a remand\norder only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court\n(at least not if, as here, this Court’s grant of certiorari\ncomes after §1453(c)’s time period has elapsed).\n   This argument, however, makes far too much of too\nlittle. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic\nitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that\nanother statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518\nU. S. 651, 660–661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n104–105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat\nute gives this Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ\nof certiorari” cases that, like this case, are “in the courts of\nappeals” when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. §1254. This\nstatutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants\nthat yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., §1254, 62 Stat.\n928; §1, 43 Stat. 938–939 (amending §240, 36 Stat. 1157);\n§240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, §6, 26 Stat. 828. This\nhistory provides particularly strong reasons not to read\n§1453(c)’s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or\nlimiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.\n    We thus interpret §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision\nwithin a specified time—not to deprive this Court of sub\nsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See Aetna Casu\nalty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467\n(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25, 28–31 (1934).\n                              III\n   We begin our “principal place of business” discussion\nwith a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution\nprovides that the “judicial Power shall extend” to “Contro\nversies . . . between Citizens of different States.” Art. III,\n§2. This language, however, does not automatically confer\ndiversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it\nauthorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine\nthe scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction within constitu\ntional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,\n233–234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87913\"><a href=\"/opinion/87913/mayor-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (1868).\n   Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise\ndiversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary\nAct, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear\nsuits “between a citizen of the State where the suit is\nbrought, and a citizen of another State.” §11, 1 Stat. 78.\nThe statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,\nChief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,\ndescribed a corporation as an “invisible, intangible, and\nartificial being” which was “certainly not a citizen.” Bank\nof United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But\nthe Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal\ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the\ncorporation’s shareholders were all citizens of a different\nState from the defendants, as “the term citizen ought to be\nunderstood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is\nused in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons\nwho come into court, in this case, under their corporate\nname.” Id., at 91–92.\n   In Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n6                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held\nthat a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of\nthe State by which it had been created, and its citizenship\nfor jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at\n558–559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti\nmore & Ohio R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1854), held that the\nreason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora\ntion was that, for the limited purpose of determining\ncorporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi\ncially) presume that a corporation’s shareholders were\ncitizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327–328.\nAnd it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325–326. Whatever\nthe rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity\npurposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be\na citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§3623, pp. 1–7 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\n   In 1928 this Court made clear that the “state of incorpo\nration” rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora\ntion closely identified with State A could proceed in a\nfederal court located in that State as long as the corpora\ntion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps\na State where the corporation did no business at all. See\nBlack and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and\nYellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522–525\n(refusing to question corporation’s reincorporation motives\nand finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in\nCongress and those who testified before it pointed out that\nthis interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction’s\nbasic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts’ doors\nto those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice\nagainst out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d\nCong., 1st Sess., 2, 4–7 (1932). Through its choice of the\nState of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate\nfederal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal\ncourts’ doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at\n4 (“Since the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora\ntion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for\ncorporations to be incorporated in one State while they do\nbusiness in another. And there is no doubt but that it\noften occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have\nthe advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of\nlitigation”). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4–5 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George\nW. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May\n24, 1930)) (citing a “common practice for individuals to\nincorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of\ntaking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts”).\nAlthough various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo\nrate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,\nS. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),\nnone of these proposals were enacted into law.\n   At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,\nmany judges began to believe those dockets contained too\nmany diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer\nence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports\nof the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and\nSpecial Meeting (Sept. 24–26 & Mar. 19–20, 1951), in\nH. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26–27 (1952).\nAnd on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on\nJurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.\nCommittee Rept.).\n   Among its observations, the committee found a general\nneed “to prevent frauds and abuses” with respect to juris\ndiction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against\neliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead\nit recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory\namendment that would make a corporation a citizen both\nof the State of its incorporation and any State from which\nit received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14–\n8                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15 (requiring corporation to show that “less than fifty per\ncent of its gross income was derived from business trans\nacted within the state where the Federal court is held”).\nIf, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state\nlaw in state court) a corporation that received half or more\nof its gross income from California, that corporation would\nnot be able to remove the case to federal court, even if\nDelaware was its State of incorporation.\n   During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem\nbers circulated their report and attended circuit confer\nences at which federal judges discussed the report’s rec\nommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee\nfiled a new report in September, in which it revised its\ncorporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed\nthat “ ‘a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state\nof its original creation . . . [and] shall also be deemed a\ncitizen of a state where it has its principal place of busi\nness.’ ” Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of\nthe Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24,\n1951) (hereinafter Sept. Committee Rept.)—the source of\nthe present-day statutory language. See Hearings on\nH. R. 2516 et al. before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House\nCommittee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 9\n(1957) (hereinafter House Hearings). The committee\nwrote that this new language would provide a “simpler\nand more practical formula” than the “gross income” test.\nSept. Committee Rept. 2. It added that the language\n“ha[d] a precedent in the jurisdictional provisions of the\nBankruptcy Act.” Id., at 2–3.\n   In mid-1957 the committee presented its reports to the\nHouse of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary.\nHouse Hearings 9–27; see also H.

In respect to the “principal place of\nbusiness” proposal, he said that the relevant language\n“ha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.” House Hear\nings 37. He added:\n    “All of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy\n    cases, and as I recall the cases—and I wouldn’t want\n    to be bound by this statement because I haven’t them\n    before me—I think the courts have generally taken\n    the view that where a corporation’s interests are\n    rather widespread, the principal place of business is\n    an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is\n    the actual place where its business operations are co\n    ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or\n    dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its\n    day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,\n    where its payments are made, and not necessarily a\n    State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo\n    ration, or something of that sort.\n      “But that has been pretty well worked out in the\n    bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,\n    you see, to be applied here without having to go over it\n    again from the beginning.” Ibid.\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference\nCommittee Reports along with other reports and relevant\ntestimony and circulated it to the general public “for the\npurpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.”\nId., at III. Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified\nthe courts’ traditional place of incorporation test and also\nenacted into law a slightly modified version of the Confer\nence Committee’s proposed “principal place of business”\nlanguage. A corporation was to “be deemed a citizen of\nany State by which it has been incorporated and of the\n10                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nState where it has its principal place of business.” §2, 72\nStat. 415.\n                             IV\n   The phrase “principal place of business” has proved\nmore difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.\nDecisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the\nfirm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because\ncourts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about\nhow to determine a corporation’s “principal place of busi\nness.” Compare Burdick v. Dillon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (CA1\n1906) (holding that a corporation’s “principal office, rather\nthan a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the ‘principal\nplace of business’ ”), with Continental Coal Corp. v.\nRoszelle Bros., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the\n“principal place of business” as the location of mining\nactivities, rather than the “principal office”); see also\nFriedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11\nStan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (“The cases under the Bank\nruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi\nnation of the principal place of business”).\n   After Congress’ amendment, courts were similarly\nuncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation’s\n“principal place of business” for diversity purposes. If a\ncorporation’s headquarters and executive offices were in\nthe same State in which it did most of its business, the\ntest seemed straightforward. The “principal place of\nbusiness” was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.\nSilver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314–315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con\nsultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906–\n907 (CA2 1996).\n   But suppose those corporate headquarters, including\nexecutive offices, are in one State, while the corporation’s\nplants or other centers of business activity are located in\nother States? In 1959 a distinguished federal district\njudge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit’s\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this ques\ntion in part:\n    “Where a corporation is engaged in far-flung and var\n    ied activities which are carried on in different states,\n    its principal place of business is the nerve center from\n    which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from\n    which its officers direct, control and coordinate all ac\n    tivities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of\n    the corporate objective. The test applied by our Court\n    of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an\n    ‘office from which its business was directed and con\n    trolled’—the place where ‘all of its business was under\n    the supreme direction and control of its officers.’ ”\n    Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.\nNumerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying\nthe “nerve center” test for corporations with “far-flung”\nbusiness activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814\nF. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et al.,\nMoore’s Federal Practice §102.54[2], p. 102–112.1 (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore’s).\n   Scot’s analysis, however, did not go far enough. For it\ndid not answer what courts should do when the operations\nof the corporation are not “far-flung” but rather limited to\nonly a few States. When faced with this question, various\ncourts have focused more heavily on where a corporation’s\nactual business activities are located. See, e.g., Diaz-\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60–61 (CA1\n2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612\nF. 2d 651, 656–657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore’s\n§102.54, at 102–112.1.\n   Perhaps because corporations come in many different\nforms, involve many different kinds of business activities,\nand locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ\nent ways in different regions, a general “business activi\nties” approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.\n12                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts must decide which factors are more important than\nothers: for example, plant location, sales or servicing\ncenters; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.\nSee, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656–657 (place of\nsales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);\nDiaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61–62 (place of stores and in\nventory, employees, income, and sales).\n   The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com\nbined aspects of the “nerve center” and “business activity”\ntests to look to a corporation’s “total activities,” sometimes\nto try to determine what treatises have described as the\ncorporation’s “center of gravity.” See, e.g., Gafford v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162–163 (CA6 1993);\nAmoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915\n(CA10 1993); 13F Wright & Miller §3625, at 100. A major\ntreatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit\nby Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha\nsize similar factors differently, and reporting that the\n“federal courts of appeals have employed various tests”—\ntests which “tend to overlap” and which are sometimes\ndescribed in “language” that “is imprecise.” 15 Moore’s\n§102.54[2], at 102–112. See also id., §§102.54[2], [13], at\n102–112 to 102–122 (describing, in 14 pages, major tests\nas looking to the “nerve center,” “locus of operations,” or\n“center of corporate activities”). Not surprisingly, differ\nent circuits (and sometimes different courts within a\nsingle circuit) have applied these highly general multifac\ntor tests in different ways. Id., §§102.54[3]–[7], [11]–[13]\n(noting that the First Circuit “has never explained a basis\nfor choosing between ‘the center of corporate activity’ test\nand the ‘locus of operations’ test”; the Second Circuit uses\na “two-part test” similar to that of the Fifth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits involving an initial determination as to\nwhether “a corporation’s activities are centralized or de\ncentralized” followed by an application of either the “place\nof operations” or “nerve center” test; the Third Circuit\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplies the “center of corporate activities” test searching\nfor the “headquarters of a corporation’s day-to-day activ\nity”; the Fourth Circuit has “endorsed neither [the ‘nerve\ncenter’ or ‘place of operations’] test to the exclusion of the\nother”; the Tenth Circuit directs consideration of the “total\nactivity of the company considered as a whole”). See also\n13F Wright & Miller §3625 (describing, in 73 pages, the\n“nerve center,” “corporate activities,” and “total activity”\ntests as part of an effort to locate the corporation’s “center\nof gravity,” while specifying different ways in which differ\nent circuits apply these or other factors).\n   This complexity may reflect an unmediated judicial\neffort to apply the statutory phrase “principal place of\nbusiness” in light of the general purpose of diversity juris\ndiction, i.e., an effort to find the State where a corporation\nis least likely to suffer out-of-state prejudice when it is\nsued in a local court, Pease v. Peck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87055\"><a href=\"/opinion/87055/pease-v-peck/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599\n(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.\nAfter all, the relevant purposive concern—prejudice\nagainst an out-of-state party—will often depend upon\nfactors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a\ncorporation’s image, its history, and its advertising, while\nthe factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam\nple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or\nthe nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some\ntimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli\nhood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at\nwar with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to\nachieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,\nan unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation\nof the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of\nAppeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpreta\n14                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,\nJudge Weinfeld’s approach, as applied in the Seventh\nCircuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at\n865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con\nclude that “principal place of business” is best read as\nreferring to the place where a corporation’s officers direct,\ncontrol, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. It is\nthe place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora\ntion’s “nerve center.” And in practice it should normally\nbe the place where the corporation maintains its head\nquarters—provided that the headquarters is the actual\ncenter of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the\n“nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpora\ntion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by\ndirectors and officers who have traveled there for the\noccasion).\n   Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us\nthat this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other\npossibilities. First, the statute’s language supports the\napproach. The statute’s text deems a corporation a citizen\nof the “State where it has its principal place of business. ”\n28 U. S. C. §1332(c)(1).           The word “place” is\nin the singular, not the plural. The word “principal” re\nquires us to pick out the “main, prominent” or “leading”\nplace. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.\n168, 174 (1993) (interpreting “principal place of business”\nfor tax purposes to require an assessment of “whether any\none business location is the ‘most important, consequen\ntial, or influential’ one”). And the fact that the word\n“place” follows the words “State where” means that the\n“place” is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.\n   A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main head\nquarters, is a single place. The public often (though not\nalways) considers it the corporation’s main place of busi\nness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of a more general business activities test has\nled some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a\nparticular place within a State, but incorrectly at the\nState itself, measuring the total amount of business activi\nties that the corporation conducts there and determining\nwhether they are “significantly larger” than in the next\nranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.\n   This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to\nstrange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.\nNamely, if a “corporation may be deemed a citizen of\nCalifornia on th[e] basis” of “activities [that] roughly\nreflect California’s larger population . . . nearly every\nnational retailer—no matter how far flung its operations—\nwill be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur\nposes.” Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,\n1029–1030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity\njurisdiction on the basis of a State’s population, whether\nmeasured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with\nmodifications?\n   Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375\n(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing\n“the sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the\narea of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible”).\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of\ntheir claims, but which court is the right court to decide\nthose claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.\n458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish\nthe likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a\nclaim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are\nat stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de\ntermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nwhen no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil\n16                HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCo., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,\nat 514.\n   Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict\nability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making\nbusiness and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City\nBank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462\nU. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the “need for certainty\nand predictability of result while generally protecting the\njustified expectations of parties with interests in the cor\nporation”). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding\nwhether to file suit in a state or federal court.\n   A “nerve center” approach, which ordinarily equates\nthat “center” with a corporation’s headquarters, is simple\nto apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor\nporate “brain,” while not precise, suggests a single loca\ntion. By contrast, a corporation’s general business activi\nties more often lack a single principal place where they\ntake place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev\neral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in\nmany different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de\ntermine which of these different business locales is the\n“principal” or most important “place.”\n   Third, the statute’s legislative history, for those who\naccept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench\nmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version\nof its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora\ntion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted\nfor more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee\nRept. 14–15; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its\nmind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too\ncomplex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.\n2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That\nhistory suggests that the words “principal place of busi\nness” should be interpreted to be no more complex than\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test\noffers such a possibility. A general business activities test\ndoes not.\n                                 B\n   We recognize that there may be no perfect test that\nsatisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We\nrecognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we\nadopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this\nera of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their\ncommand and coordinating functions among officers who\nwork at several different locations, perhaps communicat\ning over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless\npoints courts in a single direction, towards the center of\noverall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not\nhave to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve\nnues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach\nprovides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,\nnot a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener\nate a result.\n   We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test\nmay in some cases produce results that seem to cut\nagainst the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. §1332, see su\npra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business\nactivities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,\nwhile its top officers direct those activities just across the\nriver in New York, the “principal place of business” is New\nYork. One could argue that members of the public in New\nJersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the\ncorporation than persons in New York—yet the corpora\ntion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case\nto federal court. And note too that the same corporation\nwould be unable to remove a New York state case to fed\neral court, despite the New York public’s presumed preju\ndice against the corporation.\n   We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.\n18                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHowever, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,\nwe must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin\ntuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to\navoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while\nproducing the benefits that accompany a more uniform\nlegal system.\n   The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity\njurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance\nCorp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &\nMiller §3602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of\njurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega\ntions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15\nMoore’s §102.14, at 102–32 to 102–32.1. And when faced\nwith such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere\nfiling of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis\nsion’s Form 10–K listing a corporation’s “principal execu\ntive offices” would, without more, be sufficient proof to\nestablish a corporation’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., SEC\nForm 10–K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan\ncial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190–1192 (CA7\n1986) (distinguishing “principal executive office” in the tax\nlien context, see 26 U. S. C. §6323(f)(2), from “principal\nplace of business” under 28 U. S. C. §1332(c)). Such possi\nbilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,\nthereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the\n“principal place of business” language in the diversity\nstatute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu\nlation—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is\nnothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a\ncomputer, or the location of an annual executive retreat—\nthe courts should instead take as the “nerve center” the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Argued November 10, 2009––Decided February 23, 2010\nRespondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a\n  California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought\n  removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2),\n  1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif\n  ferent States, §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver\n  sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that\n  Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di\n  versity jurisdiction was lacking under §1332(c)(1), which provides\n  that “a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\n  which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin\n  cipal place of business.” To show that its “principal place of business”\n  was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration\n  stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,\n  that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,\n  that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,\n  and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar\n  ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di\n  versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under\n  Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount\n  of the corporation’s business activity is “significantly larger” or “sub\n  stantially predominates” in one State. Finding that California was\n  Hertz’s “principal place of business” under that test because a plural\n  ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court\n  remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents’ argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under\n §1453(c)—which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as\n the District Court’s only to “court[s] of appeals,” not to the Supreme\n2                        HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court, and provides that if “a final judgment on the appeal” in a court\n    of appeals “is not issued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible\n    10-day extension), “the appeal shall be denied”—makes far too much\n    of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as\n    implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute\n    specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660–661.\n    Here, replicating similar, older statutes, §1254 specifically gives the\n    Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari” cases that\n    are “in the courts of appeals” when it grants the writ. The Court thus\n    interprets §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as simply requiring a\n    court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time—not to\n    deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,\n    e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       2. The phrase “principal place of business” in §1332(c)(1) refers to\n    the place where a corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and\n    coordinate the corporation’s activities, i.e., its “nerve center,” which\n    will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5–19.\n          (a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic\n    tion demonstrates that Congress added §1332(c)(1)’s “principal place\n    of business” language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in\n    order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris\n    diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5–10.\n          (b) However, the phrase “principal place of business” has proved\n    more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After\n    Congress’ amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to\n    determine a corporation’s “principal place of business” for diversity\n    purposes. If a corporation’s headquarters and executive offices were\n    in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed\n    straightforward. The “principal place of business” was in that State.\n    But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were\n    in one State, while the corporation’s plants or other centers of busi\n    ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with “far-flung”\n    business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation’s\n    “nerve center,” from which the corporation radiates out to its con\n    stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi\n    nate the corporation’s activities. However, this test did not go far\n    enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora\n    tion’s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few\n    States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused\n    more heavily on where a corporation’s actual business activities are\n    located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter\n    pret the statute. Pp. 10–13.\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n     (c) In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of\nthe statutory phrase, this Court returns to the “nerve center” ap\nproach: “[P]rincipal place of business” is best read as referring to the\nplace where a corporation’s officers direct, control, and coordinate the\ncorporation’s activities. In practice it should normally be the place\nwhere the corporation maintains its headquarters—provided that the\nheadquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina\ntion, i.e., the “nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpo\nration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13–19.\n        (i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the\nCourt that the “nerve center” approach, while imperfect, is superior\nto other possibilities. First, §1332(c)(1)’s language supports the ap\nproach. The statute’s word “place” is singular, not plural. Its word\n“principal” requires that the main, prominent, or most important\nplace be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,\n174. And the fact that the word “place” follows the words “State\nwhere” means that the “place” is a place within a State, not the State\nitself. A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main headquarters,\nis a single place. The public often considers it the corporation’s main\nplace of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\napplication of a more general business activities test has led some\ncourts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within\na State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total\namount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and\ndetermining whether they are significantly larger than in the next\nranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in\na jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A “nerve\ncenter” approach, which ordinarily equates that “center” with a cor\nporation’s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.\nBy contrast, a corporation’s general business activities more often\nlack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat\nute’s legislative history suggests that the words “principal place of\nbusiness” should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear\nlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical\nto apply. A “nerve center” test offers such a possibility. A general\nbusiness activities test does not. Pp. 14–17.\n        (ii) While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all admin\nistrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under\nthe “nerve center” test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to\napply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets\nor revenues different in kind, one from the other. And though this\ntest may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale\nof diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive re\nsults is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex\n4                       HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that ac\n    company a more uniform legal system. Pp. 17–18.\n         (iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula\n    tion—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is nothing more\n    than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of\n    an annual executive retreat—the courts should instead take as the\n    “nerve center” the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,\n    in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18–19.\n         (d) Although petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that\n    Hertz’s “nerve center” and its corporate headquarters are one and the\n    same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re\n    spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their\n    case in light of today’s holding.

S. C. §1332(c)(1)\n(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter\npretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In\ndoing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi\ncial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as\nsimple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase\n“principal place of business” refers to the place where the\ncorporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordi\nnate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts\nhave often metaphorically called that place the corpora\ntion’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.\nNational Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);\nScot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., 170 F. Supp. 862,\n865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.). We believe that the\n“nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s\nheadquarters.\n2                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and\nJohn Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the\nHertz Corporation, in a California state court. They\nsought damages for what they claimed were violations of\nCalifornia’s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential\nclass composed of California citizens who had allegedly\nsuffered similar harms.\n   Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.\n28 U. S. C. §§1332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the\nplaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different\nStates. §§1332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court\npossessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and\nNhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a\nCalifornia citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver\nsity jurisdiction was lacking.\n   To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration\nby an employee relations manager that sought to show\nthat Hertz’s “principal place of business” was in New\nJersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among\nother things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;\nand that California—which had about 12% of the Nation’s\npopulation, Pet. for Cert. 8—accounted for 273 of Hertz’s\n1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full\ntime employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in\nannual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately\n21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara\ntion also stated that the “leadership of Hertz and its do\nmestic subsidiaries” is located at Hertz’s “corporate head\nquarters” in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its “core\nexecutive and administrative functions . . . are carried out”\nthere and “to a lesser extent” in Oklahoma City, Okla\nhoma; and that its “major administrative operations . . .\nare found” at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court of the Northern District of California\naccepted Hertz’s statement of the facts as undisputed.\nBut it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi\nzen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court\napplied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to\nidentify a corporation’s “principal place of business” by\nfirst determining the amount of a corporation’s business\nactivity State by State. If the amount of activity is “sig\nnificantly larger” or “substantially predominates” in one\nState, then that State is the corporation’s “principal place\nof business.” If there is no such State, then the “principal\nplace of business” is the corporation’s “ ‘nerve center,’ ” i.e.,\nthe place where “ ‘the majority of its executive and admin\nistrative functions are performed.’ ” Friend v. Hertz, No.\nC–07–5222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf\nter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi\nronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500–502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).\n   Applying this test, the District Court found that the\n“plurality of each of the relevant business activities” was\nin California, and that “the differential between the\namount of those activities” in California and the amount\nin “the next closest state” was “significant.” Order 4.\nHence, Hertz’s “principal place of business” was Califor\nnia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The\nDistrict Court consequently remanded the case to the\nstate courts.\n   Hertz appealed the District Court’s remand order. 28\nU. S. C. §1453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief\nmemorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz\nfiled a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences\namong the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo\nrate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco\nCorp., supra, at 500–502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.\nRussellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap\nplying “total activity” test and looking at “all corporate\nactivities”), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282\n4                   HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(applying “nerve center” test).\n                               II\n   At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.\nRespondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz\nto appeal the District Court’s remand order to the Court of\nAppeals, 28 U. S. C. §1453(c), constitutes an exception to a\nmore general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are\n“not reviewable on appeal.” §1447(d). They add that the\nlanguage of §1453(c) refers only to “court[s] of appeals,”\nnot to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if “a\nfinal judgment on the appeal” in a court of appeals “is not\nissued before the end” of 60 days (with a possible 10-day\nextension), “the appeal shall be denied.” And respondents\ndraw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion\nthat Congress intended to permit review of a remand\norder only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court\n(at least not if, as here, this Court’s grant of certiorari\ncomes after §1453(c)’s time period has elapsed).\n   This argument, however, makes far too much of too\nlittle. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic\nitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that\nanother statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518\nU. S. 651, 660–661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,\n104–105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat\nute gives this Court jurisdiction to “revie[w] . . . [b]y writ\nof certiorari” cases that, like this case, are “in the courts of\nappeals” when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. §1254. This\nstatutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants\nthat yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., §1254, 62 Stat.\n928; §1, 43 Stat. 938–939 (amending §240, 36 Stat. 1157);\n§240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, §6, 26 Stat. 828. This\nhistory provides particularly strong reasons not to read\n§1453(c)’s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or\nlimiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.\n    We thus interpret §1453(c)’s “60-day” requirement as\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision\nwithin a specified time—not to deprive this Court of sub\nsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See Aetna Casu\nalty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466–467\n(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25, 28–31 (1934).\n                              III\n   We begin our “principal place of business” discussion\nwith a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution\nprovides that the “judicial Power shall extend” to “Contro\nversies . . . between Citizens of different States.” Art. III,\n§2. This language, however, does not automatically confer\ndiversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it\nauthorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine\nthe scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction within constitu\ntional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,\n233–234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).\n   Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise\ndiversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary\nAct, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear\nsuits “between a citizen of the State where the suit is\nbrought, and a citizen of another State.” §11, 1 Stat. 78.\nThe statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,\nChief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,\ndescribed a corporation as an “invisible, intangible, and\nartificial being” which was “certainly not a citizen.” Bank\nof United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But\nthe Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal\ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the\ncorporation’s shareholders were all citizens of a different\nState from the defendants, as “the term citizen ought to be\nunderstood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is\nused in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons\nwho come into court, in this case, under their corporate\nname.” Id., at 91–92.\n   In Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497\n6                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held\nthat a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of\nthe State by which it had been created, and its citizenship\nfor jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at\n558–559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the\nreason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora\ntion was that, for the limited purpose of determining\ncorporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi\ncially) presume that a corporation’s shareholders were\ncitizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327–328.\nAnd it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325–326. Whatever\nthe rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity\npurposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be\na citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§3623, pp. 1–7 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\n   In 1928 this Court made clear that the “state of incorpo\nration” rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora\ntion closely identified with State A could proceed in a\nfederal court located in that State as long as the corpora\ntion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps\na State where the corporation did no business at all. See\nBlack and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and\nYellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522–525\n(refusing to question corporation’s reincorporation motives\nand finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in\nCongress and those who testified before it pointed out that\nthis interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction’s\nbasic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts’ doors\nto those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice\nagainst out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d\nCong., 1st Sess., 2, 4–7 (1932). Through its choice of the\nState of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate\nfederal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal\ncourts’ doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at\n4 (“Since the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora\ntion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for\ncorporations to be incorporated in one State while they do\nbusiness in another. And there is no doubt but that it\noften occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have\nthe advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of\nlitigation”).

Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May\n24, 1930)) (citing a “common practice for individuals to\nincorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of\ntaking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts”).\nAlthough various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo\nrate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,\nS. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),\nnone of these proposals were enacted into law.\n   At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,\nmany judges began to believe those dockets contained too\nmany diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer\nence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports\nof the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and\nSpecial Meeting (Sept. 24–26 & Mar. 19–20, 1951), in\nH. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26–27 (1952).\nAnd on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on\nJurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.\nCommittee Rept.).\n   Among its observations, the committee found a general\nneed “to prevent frauds and abuses” with respect to juris\ndiction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against\neliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead\nit recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory\namendment that would make a corporation a citizen both\nof the State of its incorporation and any State from which\nit received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14–\n8                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15 (requiring corporation to show that “less than fifty per\ncent of its gross income was derived from business trans\nacted within the state where the Federal court is held”).\nIf, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state\nlaw in state court) a corporation that received half or more\nof its gross income from California, that corporation would\nnot be able to remove the case to federal court, even if\nDelaware was its State of incorporation.\n   During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem\nbers circulated their report and attended circuit confer\nences at which federal judges discussed the report’s rec\nommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee\nfiled a new report in September, in which it revised its\ncorporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed\nthat “ ‘a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state\nof its original creation . . . [and] shall also be deemed a\ncitizen of a state where it has its principal place of busi\nness.’ ” Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of\nthe Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24,\n1951) (hereinafter Sept.

In respect to the “principal place of\nbusiness” proposal, he said that the relevant language\n“ha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.” House Hear\nings 37. He added:\n    “All of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy\n    cases, and as I recall the cases—and I wouldn’t want\n    to be bound by this statement because I haven’t them\n    before me—I think the courts have generally taken\n    the view that where a corporation’s interests are\n    rather widespread, the principal place of business is\n    an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is\n    the actual place where its business operations are co\n    ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or\n    dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its\n    day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,\n    where its payments are made, and not necessarily a\n    State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo\n    ration, or something of that sort.\n      “But that has been pretty well worked out in the\n    bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,\n    you see, to be applied here without having to go over it\n    again from the beginning.” Ibid.\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference\nCommittee Reports along with other reports and relevant\ntestimony and circulated it to the general public “for the\npurpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.”\nId., at III. Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified\nthe courts’ traditional place of incorporation test and also\nenacted into law a slightly modified version of the Confer\nence Committee’s proposed “principal place of business”\nlanguage. A corporation was to “be deemed a citizen of\nany State by which it has been incorporated and of the\n10                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nState where it has its principal place of business.” §2, 72\nStat. 415.\n                             IV\n   The phrase “principal place of business” has proved\nmore difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.\nDecisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the\nfirm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because\ncourts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about\nhow to determine a corporation’s “principal place of busi\nness.” Compare Burdick v. Dillon, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1\n1906) (holding that a corporation’s “principal office, rather\nthan a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the ‘principal\nplace of business’ ”), with Continental Coal Corp. v.\nRoszelle Bros., 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the\n“principal place of business” as the location of mining\nactivities, rather than the “principal office”); see also\nFriedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11\nStan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (“The cases under the Bank\nruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi\nnation of the principal place of business”).\n   After Congress’ amendment, courts were similarly\nuncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation’s\n“principal place of business” for diversity purposes. If a\ncorporation’s headquarters and executive offices were in\nthe same State in which it did most of its business, the\ntest seemed straightforward. The “principal place of\nbusiness” was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.\nSilver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314–315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con\nsultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906–\n907 (CA2 1996).\n   But suppose those corporate headquarters, including\nexecutive offices, are in one State, while the corporation’s\nplants or other centers of business activity are located in\nother States? In 1959 a distinguished federal district\njudge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit’s\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this ques\ntion in part:\n    “Where a corporation is engaged in far-flung and var\n    ied activities which are carried on in different states,\n    its principal place of business is the nerve center from\n    which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from\n    which its officers direct, control and coordinate all ac\n    tivities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of\n    the corporate objective. The test applied by our Court\n    of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an\n    ‘office from which its business was directed and con\n    trolled’—the place where ‘all of its business was under\n    the supreme direction and control of its officers.’ ”\n    Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.\nNumerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying\nthe “nerve center” test for corporations with “far-flung”\nbusiness activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814\nF. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et al.,\nMoore’s Federal Practice §102.54[2], p. 102–112.1 (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore’s).\n   Scot’s analysis, however, did not go far enough. For it\ndid not answer what courts should do when the operations\nof the corporation are not “far-flung” but rather limited to\nonly a few States. When faced with this question, various\ncourts have focused more heavily on where a corporation’s\nactual business activities are located. See, e.g., Diaz-\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60–61 (CA1\n2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612\nF. 2d 651, 656–657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore’s\n§102.54, at 102–112.1.\n   Perhaps because corporations come in many different\nforms, involve many different kinds of business activities,\nand locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ\nent ways in different regions, a general “business activi\nties” approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.\n12                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts must decide which factors are more important than\nothers: for example, plant location, sales or servicing\ncenters; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.\nSee, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656–657 (place of\nsales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);\nDiaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61–62 (place of stores and in\nventory, employees, income, and sales).\n   The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com\nbined aspects of the “nerve center” and “business activity”\ntests to look to a corporation’s “total activities,” sometimes\nto try to determine what treatises have described as the\ncorporation’s “center of gravity.” See, e.g., Gafford v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162–163 (CA6 1993);\nAmoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915\n(CA10 1993); 13F Wright & Miller §3625, at 100. A major\ntreatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit\nby Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha\nsize similar factors differently, and reporting that the\n“federal courts of appeals have employed various tests”—\ntests which “tend to overlap” and which are sometimes\ndescribed in “language” that “is imprecise.” 15 Moore’s\n§102.54[2], at 102–112. See also id., §§102.54[2], [13], at\n102–112 to 102–122 (describing, in 14 pages, major tests\nas looking to the “nerve center,” “locus of operations,” or\n“center of corporate activities”). Not surprisingly, differ\nent circuits (and sometimes different courts within a\nsingle circuit) have applied these highly general multifac\ntor tests in different ways. Id., §§102.54[3]–[7], [11]–[13]\n(noting that the First Circuit “has never explained a basis\nfor choosing between ‘the center of corporate activity’ test\nand the ‘locus of operations’ test”; the Second Circuit uses\na “two-part test” similar to that of the Fifth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits involving an initial determination as to\nwhether “a corporation’s activities are centralized or de\ncentralized” followed by an application of either the “place\nof operations” or “nerve center” test; the Third Circuit\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplies the “center of corporate activities” test searching\nfor the “headquarters of a corporation’s day-to-day activ\nity”; the Fourth Circuit has “endorsed neither [the ‘nerve\ncenter’ or ‘place of operations’] test to the exclusion of the\nother”; the Tenth Circuit directs consideration of the “total\nactivity of the company considered as a whole”). See also\n13F Wright & Miller §3625 (describing, in 73 pages, the\n“nerve center,” “corporate activities,” and “total activity”\ntests as part of an effort to locate the corporation’s “center\nof gravity,” while specifying different ways in which differ\nent circuits apply these or other factors).\n   This complexity may reflect an unmediated judicial\neffort to apply the statutory phrase “principal place of\nbusiness” in light of the general purpose of diversity juris\ndiction, i.e., an effort to find the State where a corporation\nis least likely to suffer out-of-state prejudice when it is\nsued in a local court, Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 599\n(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.\nAfter all, the relevant purposive concern—prejudice\nagainst an out-of-state party—will often depend upon\nfactors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a\ncorporation’s image, its history, and its advertising, while\nthe factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam\nple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or\nthe nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some\ntimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli\nhood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at\nwar with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to\nachieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,\nan unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation\nof the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of\nAppeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpreta\n14                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,\nJudge Weinfeld’s approach, as applied in the Seventh\nCircuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at\n865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con\nclude that “principal place of business” is best read as\nreferring to the place where a corporation’s officers direct,\ncontrol, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. It is\nthe place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora\ntion’s “nerve center.” And in practice it should normally\nbe the place where the corporation maintains its head\nquarters—provided that the headquarters is the actual\ncenter of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the\n“nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corpora\ntion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by\ndirectors and officers who have traveled there for the\noccasion).\n   Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us\nthat this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other\npossibilities. First, the statute’s language supports the\napproach. The statute’s text deems a corporation a citizen\nof the “State where it has its principal place of business. ”\n28 U. S. C. §1332(c)(1).           The word “place” is\nin the singular, not the plural. The word “principal” re\nquires us to pick out the “main, prominent” or “leading”\nplace. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.\n168, 174 (1993) (interpreting “principal place of business”\nfor tax purposes to require an assessment of “whether any\none business location is the ‘most important, consequen\ntial, or influential’ one”). And the fact that the word\n“place” follows the words “State where” means that the\n“place” is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.\n   A corporation’s “nerve center,” usually its main head\nquarters, is a single place. The public often (though not\nalways) considers it the corporation’s main place of busi\nness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of a more general business activities test has\nled some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a\nparticular place within a State, but incorrectly at the\nState itself, measuring the total amount of business activi\nties that the corporation conducts there and determining\nwhether they are “significantly larger” than in the next\nranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.\n   This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to\nstrange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.\nNamely, if a “corporation may be deemed a citizen of\nCalifornia on th[e] basis” of “activities [that] roughly\nreflect California’s larger population . . . nearly every\nnational retailer—no matter how far flung its operations—\nwill be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur\nposes.” Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,\n1029–1030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity\njurisdiction on the basis of a State’s population, whether\nmeasured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with\nmodifications?\n   Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375\n(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing\n“the sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the\narea of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible”).\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of\ntheir claims, but which court is the right court to decide\nthose claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.\n458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish\nthe likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a\nclaim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are\nat stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de\ntermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nwhen no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil\n16                HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCo., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,\nat 514.\n   Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict\nability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making\nbusiness and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City\nBank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462\nU. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the “need for certainty\nand predictability of result while generally protecting the\njustified expectations of parties with interests in the cor\nporation”). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding\nwhether to file suit in a state or federal court.\n   A “nerve center” approach, which ordinarily equates\nthat “center” with a corporation’s headquarters, is simple\nto apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor\nporate “brain,” while not precise, suggests a single loca\ntion. By contrast, a corporation’s general business activi\nties more often lack a single principal place where they\ntake place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev\neral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in\nmany different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de\ntermine which of these different business locales is the\n“principal” or most important “place.”\n   Third, the statute’s legislative history, for those who\naccept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench\nmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version\nof its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora\ntion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted\nfor more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee\nRept. 14–15; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its\nmind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too\ncomplex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.\n2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That\nhistory suggests that the words “principal place of busi\nness” should be interpreted to be no more complex than\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test\noffers such a possibility. A general business activities test\ndoes not.\n                                 B\n   We recognize that there may be no perfect test that\nsatisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We\nrecognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we\nadopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this\nera of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their\ncommand and coordinating functions among officers who\nwork at several different locations, perhaps communicat\ning over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless\npoints courts in a single direction, towards the center of\noverall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not\nhave to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve\nnues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach\nprovides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,\nnot a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener\nate a result.\n   We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test\nmay in some cases produce results that seem to cut\nagainst the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. §1332, see su\npra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business\nactivities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,\nwhile its top officers direct those activities just across the\nriver in New York, the “principal place of business” is New\nYork. One could argue that members of the public in New\nJersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the\ncorporation than persons in New York—yet the corpora\ntion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case\nto federal court. And note too that the same corporation\nwould be unable to remove a New York state case to fed\neral court, despite the New York public’s presumed preju\ndice against the corporation.\n   We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.\n18                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHowever, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,\nwe must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin\ntuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to\navoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while\nproducing the benefits that accompany a more uniform\nlegal system.\n   The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity\njurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance\nCorp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &\nMiller §3602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of\njurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega\ntions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15\nMoore’s §102.14, at 102–32 to 102–32.1. And when faced\nwith such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere\nfiling of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis\nsion’s Form 10–K listing a corporation’s “principal execu\ntive offices” would, without more, be sufficient proof to\nestablish a corporation’s “nerve center.” See, e.g., SEC\nForm 10–K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan\ncial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190–1192 (CA7\n1986) (distinguishing “principal executive office” in the tax\nlien context, see 26 U. S. C. §6323(f)(2), from “principal\nplace of business” under 28 U. S. C. §1332(c)). Such possi\nbilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,\nthereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the\n“principal place of business” language in the diversity\nstatute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu\nlation—for example, that the alleged “nerve center” is\nnothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a\ncomputer, or the location of an annual executive retreat—\nthe courts should instead take as the “nerve center” the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplace of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the\nabsence of such manipulation.\n                             VI\n  Petitioner’s unchallenged declaration suggests that\nHertz’s center of direction, control, and coordination, its\n“nerve center,” and its corporate headquarters are one and\nthe same, and they are located in New Jersey, not in\nCalifornia. Because respondents should have a fair op-\nportunity to litigate their case in light of our holding,\nhowever, we vacate the Ninth Circuit’s judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1735/", "sha1": "d9a57beb04d1993c5ccbb557001eec1defb9e0ab", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-023", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:10"}
