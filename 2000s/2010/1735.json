FRIEND ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 08\u20131107. Argued November 10, 2009\u2013\u2013Decided February 23, 2010\nRespondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a\n  California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought\n  removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2),\n  1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif\n  ferent States, \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver\n  sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that\n  Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di\n  versity jurisdiction was lacking under \u00a71332(c)(1), which provides\n  that \u201ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\n  which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin\n  cipal place of business.\u201d To show that its \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\n  was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration\n  stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,\n  that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,\n  that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,\n  and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar\n  ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di\n  versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under\n  Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount\n  of the corporation\u2019s business activity is \u201csignificantly larger\u201d or \u201csub\n  stantially predominates\u201d in one State. Finding that California was\n  Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d under that test because a plural\n  ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court\n  remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents\u2019 argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under\n \u00a71453(c)\u2014which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as\n the District Court\u2019s only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d not to the Supreme\n2                        HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court, and provides that if \u201ca final judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court\n    of appeals \u201cis not issued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible\n    10-day extension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied\u201d\u2014makes far too much\n    of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as\n    implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute\n    specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660\u2013661.\n    Here, replicating similar, older statutes, \u00a71254 specifically gives the\n    Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari\u201d cases that\n    are \u201cin the courts of appeals\u201d when it grants the writ. The Court thus\n    interprets \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as simply requiring a\n    court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time\u2014not to\n    deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,\n    e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466\u2013467.\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       2. The phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d in \u00a71332(c)(1) refers to\n    the place where a corporation\u2019s high level officers direct, control, and\n    coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities, i.e., its \u201cnerve center,\u201d which\n    will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5\u201319.\n          (a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic\n    tion demonstrates that Congress added \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\n    of business\u201d language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in\n    order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris\n    diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5\u201310.\n          (b) However, the phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d has proved\n    more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After\n    Congress\u2019 amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to\n    determine a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d for diversity\n    purposes. If a corporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were\n    in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed\n    straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in that State.\n    But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were\n    in one State, while the corporation\u2019s plants or other centers of busi\n    ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with \u201cfar-flung\u201d\n    business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation\u2019s\n    \u201cnerve center,\u201d from which the corporation radiates out to its con\n    stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi\n    nate the corporation\u2019s activities. However, this test did not go far\n    enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora\n    tion\u2019s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few\n    States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused\n    more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s actual business activities are\n    located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter\n    pret the statute. Pp. 10\u201313.\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n     (c) In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of\nthe statutory phrase, this Court returns to the \u201cnerve center\u201d ap\nproach: \u201c[P]rincipal place of business\u201d is best read as referring to the\nplace where a corporation\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate the\ncorporation\u2019s activities. In practice it should normally be the place\nwhere the corporation maintains its headquarters\u2014provided that the\nheadquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina\ntion, i.e., the \u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpo\nration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13\u201319.\n        (i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the\nCourt that the \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, while imperfect, is superior\nto other possibilities. First, \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s language supports the ap\nproach. The statute\u2019s word \u201cplace\u201d is singular, not plural. Its word\n\u201cprincipal\u201d requires that the main, prominent, or most important\nplace be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,\n174. And the fact that the word \u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState\nwhere\u201d means that the \u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State, not the State\nitself. A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main headquarters,\nis a single place. The public often considers it the corporation\u2019s main\nplace of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\napplication of a more general business activities test has led some\ncourts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within\na State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total\namount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and\ndetermining whether they are significantly larger than in the next\nranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in\na jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A \u201cnerve\ncenter\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates that \u201ccenter\u201d with a cor\nporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.\nBy contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activities more often\nlack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat\nute\u2019s legislative history suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear\nlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical\nto apply. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test offers such a possibility. A general\nbusiness activities test does not. Pp. 14\u201317.\n        (ii) While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all admin\nistrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under\nthe \u201cnerve center\u201d test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to\napply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets\nor revenues different in kind, one from the other. And though this\ntest may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale\nof diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive re\nsults is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex\n4                       HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that ac\n    company a more uniform legal system. Pp. 17\u201318.\n         (iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula\n    tion\u2014for example, that the alleged \u201cnerve center\u201d is nothing more\n    than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of\n    an annual executive retreat\u2014the courts should instead take as the\n    \u201cnerve center\u201d the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,\n    in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18\u201319.\n         (d) Although petitioner\u2019s unchallenged declaration suggests that\n    Hertz\u2019s \u201cnerve center\u201d and its corporate headquarters are one and the\n    same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re\n    spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their\n    case in light of today\u2019s holding.

S. C. \u00a71332(c)(1)\n(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter\npretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In\ndoing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi\ncial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as\nsimple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d refers to the place where the\ncorporation\u2019s high level officers direct, control, and coordi\nnate the corporation\u2019s activities. Lower federal courts\nhave often metaphorically called that place the corpora\ntion\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.\nNational Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);\nScot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., 170 F. Supp. 862,\n865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.). We believe that the\n\u201cnerve center\u201d will typically be found at a corporation\u2019s\nheadquarters.\n2                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and\nJohn Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the\nHertz Corporation, in a California state court. They\nsought damages for what they claimed were violations of\nCalifornia\u2019s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential\nclass composed of California citizens who had allegedly\nsuffered similar harms.\n   Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the\nplaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different\nStates. \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court\npossessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and\nNhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a\nCalifornia citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver\nsity jurisdiction was lacking.\n   To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration\nby an employee relations manager that sought to show\nthat Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in New\nJersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among\nother things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;\nand that California\u2014which had about 12% of the Nation\u2019s\npopulation, Pet. for Cert. 8\u2014accounted for 273 of Hertz\u2019s\n1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full\ntime employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in\nannual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately\n21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara\ntion also stated that the \u201cleadership of Hertz and its do\nmestic subsidiaries\u201d is located at Hertz\u2019s \u201ccorporate head\nquarters\u201d in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its \u201ccore\nexecutive and administrative functions . . . are carried out\u201d\nthere and \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d in Oklahoma City, Okla\nhoma; and that its \u201cmajor administrative operations . . .\nare found\u201d at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court of the Northern District of California\naccepted Hertz\u2019s statement of the facts as undisputed.\nBut it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi\nzen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court\napplied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to\nidentify a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d by\nfirst determining the amount of a corporation\u2019s business\nactivity State by State. If the amount of activity is \u201csig\nnificantly larger\u201d or \u201csubstantially predominates\u201d in one\nState, then that State is the corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\nof business.\u201d If there is no such State, then the \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d is the corporation\u2019s \u201c \u2018nerve center,\u2019 \u201d i.e.,\nthe place where \u201c \u2018the majority of its executive and admin\nistrative functions are performed.\u2019 \u201d Friend v. Hertz, No.\nC\u201307\u20135222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf\nter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi\nronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500\u2013502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).\n   Applying this test, the District Court found that the\n\u201cplurality of each of the relevant business activities\u201d was\nin California, and that \u201cthe differential between the\namount of those activities\u201d in California and the amount\nin \u201cthe next closest state\u201d was \u201csignificant.\u201d Order 4.\nHence, Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was Califor\nnia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The\nDistrict Court consequently remanded the case to the\nstate courts.\n   Hertz appealed the District Court\u2019s remand order. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief\nmemorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz\nfiled a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences\namong the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo\nrate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco\nCorp., supra, at 500\u2013502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.\nRussellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap\nplying \u201ctotal activity\u201d test and looking at \u201call corporate\nactivities\u201d), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282\n4                   HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(applying \u201cnerve center\u201d test).\n                               II\n   At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.\nRespondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz\nto appeal the District Court\u2019s remand order to the Court of\nAppeals, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71453(c), constitutes an exception to a\nmore general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are\n\u201cnot reviewable on appeal.\u201d \u00a71447(d). They add that the\nlanguage of \u00a71453(c) refers only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d\nnot to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if \u201ca\nfinal judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court of appeals \u201cis not\nissued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible 10-day\nextension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied.\u201d And respondents\ndraw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion\nthat Congress intended to permit review of a remand\norder only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court\n(at least not if, as here, this Court\u2019s grant of certiorari\ncomes after \u00a71453(c)\u2019s time period has elapsed).\n   This argument, however, makes far too much of too\nlittle. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic\nitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that\nanother statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518\nU. S. 651, 660\u2013661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,\n104\u2013105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat\nute gives this Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . . [b]y writ\nof certiorari\u201d cases that, like this case, are \u201cin the courts of\nappeals\u201d when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254. This\nstatutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants\nthat yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., \u00a71254, 62 Stat.\n928; \u00a71, 43 Stat. 938\u2013939 (amending \u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157);\n\u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, \u00a76, 26 Stat. 828. This\nhistory provides particularly strong reasons not to read\n\u00a71453(c)\u2019s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or\nlimiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.\n    We thus interpret \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

S. 25, 28\u201331 (1934).\n                              III\n   We begin our \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d discussion\nwith a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution\nprovides that the \u201cjudicial Power shall extend\u201d to \u201cContro\nversies . . . between Citizens of different States.\u201d Art. III,\n\u00a72. This language, however, does not automatically confer\ndiversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it\nauthorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine\nthe scope of the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction within constitu\ntional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,\n233\u2013234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).\n   Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise\ndiversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary\nAct, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear\nsuits \u201cbetween a citizen of the State where the suit is\nbrought, and a citizen of another State.\u201d \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78.\nThe statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,\nChief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,\ndescribed a corporation as an \u201cinvisible, intangible, and\nartificial being\u201d which was \u201ccertainly not a citizen.\u201d Bank\nof United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But\nthe Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal\ncourts\u2019 diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the\ncorporation\u2019s shareholders were all citizens of a different\nState from the defendants, as \u201cthe term citizen ought to be\nunderstood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is\nused in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons\nwho come into court, in this case, under their corporate\nname.\u201d Id., at 91\u201392.\n   In Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497\n6                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held\nthat a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of\nthe State by which it had been created, and its citizenship\nfor jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at\n558\u2013559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the\nreason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora\ntion was that, for the limited purpose of determining\ncorporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi\ncially) presume that a corporation\u2019s shareholders were\ncitizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327\u2013328.\nAnd it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325\u2013326. Whatever\nthe rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity\npurposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be\na citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73623, pp. 1\u20137 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\n   In 1928 this Court made clear that the \u201cstate of incorpo\nration\u201d rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora\ntion closely identified with State A could proceed in a\nfederal court located in that State as long as the corpora\ntion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps\na State where the corporation did no business at all. See\nBlack and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and\nYellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522\u2013525\n(refusing to question corporation\u2019s reincorporation motives\nand finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in\nCongress and those who testified before it pointed out that\nthis interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction\u2019s\nbasic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts\u2019 doors\nto those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice\nagainst out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d\nCong., 1st Sess., 2, 4\u20137 (1932). Through its choice of the\nState of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate\nfederal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal\ncourts\u2019 doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness by filing incorporation papers elsewhere. Id., at\n4 (\u201cSince the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora\ntion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for\ncorporations to be incorporated in one State while they do\nbusiness in another. And there is no doubt but that it\noften occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have\nthe advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of\nlitigation\u201d). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4\u20135 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George\nW. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May\n24, 1930)) (citing a \u201ccommon practice for individuals to\nincorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of\ntaking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts\u201d).\nAlthough various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo\nrate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,\nS. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),\nnone of these proposals were enacted into law.\n   At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,\nmany judges began to believe those dockets contained too\nmany diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer\nence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports\nof the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and\nSpecial Meeting (Sept. 24\u201326 & Mar. 19\u201320, 1951), in\nH. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26\u201327 (1952).\nAnd on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on\nJurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.\nCommittee Rept.).\n   Among its observations, the committee found a general\nneed \u201cto prevent frauds and abuses\u201d with respect to juris\ndiction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against\neliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead\nit recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory\namendment that would make a corporation a citizen both\nof the State of its incorporation and any State from which\nit received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14\u2013\n8                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15 (requiring corporation to show that \u201cless than fifty per\ncent of its gross income was derived from business trans\nacted within the state where the Federal court is held\u201d).\nIf, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state\nlaw in state court) a corporation that received half or more\nof its gross income from California, that corporation would\nnot be able to remove the case to federal court, even if\nDelaware was its State of incorporation.\n   During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem\nbers circulated their report and attended circuit confer\nences at which federal judges discussed the report\u2019s rec\nommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee\nfiled a new report in September, in which it revised its\ncorporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed\nthat \u201c \u2018a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state\nof its original creation . . . [and] shall also be deemed a\ncitizen of a state where it has its principal place of busi\nness.\u2019 \u201d Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of\nthe Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24,\n1951) (hereinafter Sept.

R. 2516 et al. before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House\nCommittee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 9\n(1957) (hereinafter House Hearings).

In respect to the \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d proposal, he said that the relevant language\n\u201cha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d House Hear\nings 37. He added:\n    \u201cAll of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy\n    cases, and as I recall the cases\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t want\n    to be bound by this statement because I haven\u2019t them\n    before me\u2014I think the courts have generally taken\n    the view that where a corporation\u2019s interests are\n    rather widespread, the principal place of business is\n    an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is\n    the actual place where its business operations are co\n    ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or\n    dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its\n    day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,\n    where its payments are made, and not necessarily a\n    State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo\n    ration, or something of that sort.\n      \u201cBut that has been pretty well worked out in the\n    bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,\n    you see, to be applied here without having to go over it\n    again from the beginning.\u201d Ibid.\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference\nCommittee Reports along with other reports and relevant\ntestimony and circulated it to the general public \u201cfor the\npurpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.\u201d\nId., at III. Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified\nthe courts\u2019 traditional place of incorporation test and also\nenacted into law a slightly modified version of the Confer\nence Committee\u2019s proposed \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\nlanguage. A corporation was to \u201cbe deemed a citizen of\nany State by which it has been incorporated and of the\n10                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nState where it has its principal place of business.\u201d \u00a72, 72\nStat. 415.\n                             IV\n   The phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d has proved\nmore difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.\nDecisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the\nfirm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because\ncourts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about\nhow to determine a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of busi\nness.\u201d Compare Burdick v. Dillon, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1\n1906) (holding that a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal office, rather\nthan a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the \u2018principal\nplace of business\u2019 \u201d), with Continental Coal Corp. v.\nRoszelle Bros., 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d as the location of mining\nactivities, rather than the \u201cprincipal office\u201d); see also\nFriedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11\nStan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (\u201cThe cases under the Bank\nruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi\nnation of the principal place of business\u201d).\n   After Congress\u2019 amendment, courts were similarly\nuncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation\u2019s\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d for diversity purposes. If a\ncorporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were in\nthe same State in which it did most of its business, the\ntest seemed straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.\nSilver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314\u2013315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con\nsultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906\u2013\n907 (CA2 1996).\n   But suppose those corporate headquarters, including\nexecutive offices, are in one State, while the corporation\u2019s\nplants or other centers of business activity are located in\nother States?

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this ques\ntion in part:\n    \u201cWhere a corporation is engaged in far-flung and var\n    ied activities which are carried on in different states,\n    its principal place of business is the nerve center from\n    which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from\n    which its officers direct, control and coordinate all ac\n    tivities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of\n    the corporate objective. The test applied by our Court\n    of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an\n    \u2018office from which its business was directed and con\n    trolled\u2019\u2014the place where \u2018all of its business was under\n    the supreme direction and control of its officers.\u2019 \u201d\n    Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.\nNumerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying\nthe \u201cnerve center\u201d test for corporations with \u201cfar-flung\u201d\nbusiness activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814\nF. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et al.,\nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7102.54[2], p. 102\u2013112.1 (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore\u2019s).\n   Scot\u2019s analysis, however, did not go far enough. For it\ndid not answer what courts should do when the operations\nof the corporation are not \u201cfar-flung\u201d but rather limited to\nonly a few States. When faced with this question, various\ncourts have focused more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s\nactual business activities are located. See, e.g., Diaz-\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60\u201361 (CA1\n2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612\nF. 2d 651, 656\u2013657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore\u2019s\n\u00a7102.54, at 102\u2013112.1.\n   Perhaps because corporations come in many different\nforms, involve many different kinds of business activities,\nand locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ\nent ways in different regions, a general \u201cbusiness activi\nties\u201d approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.\n12                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts must decide which factors are more important than\nothers: for example, plant location, sales or servicing\ncenters; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.\nSee, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656\u2013657 (place of\nsales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);\nDiaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61\u201362 (place of stores and in\nventory, employees, income, and sales).\n   The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com\nbined aspects of the \u201cnerve center\u201d and \u201cbusiness activity\u201d\ntests to look to a corporation\u2019s \u201ctotal activities,\u201d sometimes\nto try to determine what treatises have described as the\ncorporation\u2019s \u201ccenter of gravity.\u201d See, e.g., Gafford v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162\u2013163 (CA6 1993);\nAmoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915\n(CA10 1993); 13F Wright & Miller \u00a73625, at 100. A major\ntreatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit\nby Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha\nsize similar factors differently, and reporting that the\n\u201cfederal courts of appeals have employed various tests\u201d\u2014\ntests which \u201ctend to overlap\u201d and which are sometimes\ndescribed in \u201clanguage\u201d that \u201cis imprecise.\u201d 15 Moore\u2019s\n\u00a7102.54[2], at 102\u2013112.

Peck, 18 How. 595, 599\n(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.\nAfter all, the relevant purposive concern\u2014prejudice\nagainst an out-of-state party\u2014will often depend upon\nfactors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a\ncorporation\u2019s image, its history, and its advertising, while\nthe factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam\nple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or\nthe nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some\ntimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli\nhood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at\nwar with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to\nachieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,\nan unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation\nof the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of\nAppeals\u2019 divergent and increasingly complex interpreta\n14                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,\nJudge Weinfeld\u2019s approach, as applied in the Seventh\nCircuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at\n865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con\nclude that \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is best read as\nreferring to the place where a corporation\u2019s officers direct,\ncontrol, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities. It is\nthe place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora\ntion\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d And in practice it should normally\nbe the place where the corporation maintains its head\nquarters\u2014provided that the headquarters is the actual\ncenter of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the\n\u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpora\ntion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by\ndirectors and officers who have traveled there for the\noccasion).\n   Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us\nthat this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other\npossibilities. First, the statute\u2019s language supports the\napproach. The statute\u2019s text deems a corporation a citizen\nof the \u201cState where it has its principal place of business. \u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)(1).           The word \u201cplace\u201d is\nin the singular, not the plural. The word \u201cprincipal\u201d re\nquires us to pick out the \u201cmain, prominent\u201d or \u201cleading\u201d\nplace. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.\n168, 174 (1993) (interpreting \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\nfor tax purposes to require an assessment of \u201cwhether any\none business location is the \u2018most important, consequen\ntial, or influential\u2019 one\u201d). And the fact that the word\n\u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState where\u201d means that the\n\u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.\n   A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main head\nquarters, is a single place. The public often (though not\nalways) considers it the corporation\u2019s main place of busi\nness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Appx. 690.\n   This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to\nstrange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.\nNamely, if a \u201ccorporation may be deemed a citizen of\nCalifornia on th[e] basis\u201d of \u201cactivities [that] roughly\nreflect California\u2019s larger population . . . nearly every\nnational retailer\u2014no matter how far flung its operations\u2014\nwill be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur\nposes.\u201d Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,\n1029\u20131030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity\njurisdiction on the basis of a State\u2019s population, whether\nmeasured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with\nmodifications?\n   Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375\n(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing\n\u201cthe sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the\narea of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible\u201d).\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of\ntheir claims, but which court is the right court to decide\nthose claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.\n458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish\nthe likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a\nclaim\u2019s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are\nat stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de\ntermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nwhen no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil\n16                HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCo., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,\nat 514.\n   Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict\nability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making\nbusiness and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City\nBank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462\nU. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the \u201cneed for certainty\nand predictability of result while generally protecting the\njustified expectations of parties with interests in the cor\nporation\u201d). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding\nwhether to file suit in a state or federal court.\n   A \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates\nthat \u201ccenter\u201d with a corporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple\nto apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor\nporate \u201cbrain,\u201d while not precise, suggests a single loca\ntion. By contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activi\nties more often lack a single principal place where they\ntake place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev\neral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in\nmany different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de\ntermine which of these different business locales is the\n\u201cprincipal\u201d or most important \u201cplace.\u201d\n   Third, the statute\u2019s legislative history, for those who\naccept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench\nmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version\nof its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora\ntion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted\nfor more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee\nRept. 14\u201315; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its\nmind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too\ncomplex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.\n2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That\nhistory suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of busi\nness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe initial \u201chalf of gross income\u201d test. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test\noffers such a possibility. A general business activities test\ndoes not.\n                                 B\n   We recognize that there may be no perfect test that\nsatisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We\nrecognize as well that, under the \u201cnerve center\u201d test we\nadopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this\nera of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their\ncommand and coordinating functions among officers who\nwork at several different locations, perhaps communicat\ning over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless\npoints courts in a single direction, towards the center of\noverall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not\nhave to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve\nnues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach\nprovides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,\nnot a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener\nate a result.\n   We also recognize that the use of a \u201cnerve center\u201d test\nmay in some cases produce results that seem to cut\nagainst the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, see su\npra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company\u2019s business\nactivities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,\nwhile its top officers direct those activities just across the\nriver in New York, the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is New\nYork. One could argue that members of the public in New\nJersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the\ncorporation than persons in New York\u2014yet the corpora\ntion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case\nto federal court. And note too that the same corporation\nwould be unable to remove a New York state case to fed\neral court, despite the New York public\u2019s presumed preju\ndice against the corporation.\n   We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.\n18                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHowever, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,\nwe must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin\ntuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to\navoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while\nproducing the benefits that accompany a more uniform\nlegal system.\n   The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity\njurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance\nCorp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &\nMiller \u00a73602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of\njurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega\ntions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15\nMoore\u2019s \u00a7102.14, at 102\u201332 to 102\u201332.1. And when faced\nwith such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere\nfiling of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis\nsion\u2019s Form 10\u2013K listing a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal execu\ntive offices\u201d would, without more, be sufficient proof to\nestablish a corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d See, e.g., SEC\nForm 10\u2013K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan\ncial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190\u20131192 (CA7\n1986) (distinguishing \u201cprincipal executive office\u201d in the tax\nlien context, see 26 U. S. C. \u00a76323(f)(2), from \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)). Such possi\nbilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,\nthereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d language in the diversity\nstatute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu\nlation\u2014for example, that the alleged \u201cnerve center\u201d is\nnothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a\ncomputer, or the location of an annual executive retreat\u2014\nthe courts should instead take as the \u201cnerve center\u201d the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

FRIEND ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 08\u20131107. Argued November 10, 2009\u2013\u2013Decided February 23, 2010\nRespondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a\n  California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought\n  removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2),\n  1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif\n  ferent States, \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver\n  sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that\n  Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di\n  versity jurisdiction was lacking under \u00a71332(c)(1), which provides\n  that \u201ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\n  which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin\n  cipal place of business.\u201d To show that its \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\n  was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration\n  stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,\n  that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,\n  that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,\n  and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar\n  ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di\n  versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under\n  Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount\n  of the corporation\u2019s business activity is \u201csignificantly larger\u201d or \u201csub\n  stantially predominates\u201d in one State. Finding that California was\n  Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d under that test because a plural\n  ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court\n  remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents\u2019 argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under\n \u00a71453(c)\u2014which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as\n the District Court\u2019s only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d not to the Supreme\n2                        HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court, and provides that if \u201ca final judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court\n    of appeals \u201cis not issued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible\n    10-day extension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied\u201d\u2014makes far too much\n    of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as\n    implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute\n    specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660\u2013661.\n    Here, replicating similar, older statutes, \u00a71254 specifically gives the\n    Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari\u201d cases that\n    are \u201cin the courts of appeals\u201d when it grants the writ. The Court thus\n    interprets \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as simply requiring a\n    court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time\u2014not to\n    deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,\n    e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466\u2013467.\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       2. The phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d in \u00a71332(c)(1) refers to\n    the place where a corporation\u2019s high level officers direct, control, and\n    coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities, i.e., its \u201cnerve center,\u201d which\n    will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5\u201319.\n          (a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic\n    tion demonstrates that Congress added \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\n    of business\u201d language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in\n    order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris\n    diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5\u201310.\n          (b) However, the phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d has proved\n    more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After\n    Congress\u2019 amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to\n    determine a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d for diversity\n    purposes. If a corporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were\n    in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed\n    straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in that State.\n    But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were\n    in one State, while the corporation\u2019s plants or other centers of busi\n    ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with \u201cfar-flung\u201d\n    business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation\u2019s\n    \u201cnerve center,\u201d from which the corporation radiates out to its con\n    stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi\n    nate the corporation\u2019s activities. However, this test did not go far\n    enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora\n    tion\u2019s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few\n    States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused\n    more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s actual business activities are\n    located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter\n    pret the statute. Pp. 10\u201313.\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n     (c) In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of\nthe statutory phrase, this Court returns to the \u201cnerve center\u201d ap\nproach: \u201c[P]rincipal place of business\u201d is best read as referring to the\nplace where a corporation\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate the\ncorporation\u2019s activities. In practice it should normally be the place\nwhere the corporation maintains its headquarters\u2014provided that the\nheadquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina\ntion, i.e., the \u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpo\nration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13\u201319.\n        (i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the\nCourt that the \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, while imperfect, is superior\nto other possibilities. First, \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s language supports the ap\nproach. The statute\u2019s word \u201cplace\u201d is singular, not plural. Its word\n\u201cprincipal\u201d requires that the main, prominent, or most important\nplace be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,\n174. And the fact that the word \u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState\nwhere\u201d means that the \u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State, not the State\nitself. A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main headquarters,\nis a single place. The public often considers it the corporation\u2019s main\nplace of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\napplication of a more general business activities test has led some\ncourts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within\na State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total\namount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and\ndetermining whether they are significantly larger than in the next\nranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in\na jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A \u201cnerve\ncenter\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates that \u201ccenter\u201d with a cor\nporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.\nBy contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activities more often\nlack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat\nute\u2019s legislative history suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear\nlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical\nto apply. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test offers such a possibility. A general\nbusiness activities test does not. Pp. 14\u201317.\n        (ii) While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all admin\nistrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under\nthe \u201cnerve center\u201d test adopted today, this test is relatively easier to\napply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets\nor revenues different in kind, one from the other. And though this\ntest may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale\nof diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive re\nsults is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex\n4                       HERTZ CORP. v.

Pp. 17\u201318.\n         (iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipula\n    tion\u2014for example, that the alleged \u201cnerve center\u201d is nothing more\n    than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of\n    an annual executive retreat\u2014the courts should instead take as the\n    \u201cnerve center\u201d the place of actual direction, control, and coordination,\n    in the absence of such manipulation. Pp. 18\u201319.\n         (d) Although petitioner\u2019s unchallenged declaration suggests that\n    Hertz\u2019s \u201cnerve center\u201d and its corporate headquarters are one and the\n    same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, re\n    spondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their\n    case in light of today\u2019s holding.

FRIEND \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and\nJohn Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the\nHertz Corporation, in a California state court. They\nsought damages for what they claimed were violations of\nCalifornia\u2019s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential\nclass composed of California citizens who had allegedly\nsuffered similar harms.\n   Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the\nplaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different\nStates. \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court\npossessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and\nNhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a\nCalifornia citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver\nsity jurisdiction was lacking.\n   To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration\nby an employee relations manager that sought to show\nthat Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in New\nJersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among\nother things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;\nand that California\u2014which had about 12% of the Nation\u2019s\npopulation, Pet. for Cert. 8\u2014accounted for 273 of Hertz\u2019s\n1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full\ntime employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in\nannual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately\n21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara\ntion also stated that the \u201cleadership of Hertz and its do\nmestic subsidiaries\u201d is located at Hertz\u2019s \u201ccorporate head\nquarters\u201d in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its \u201ccore\nexecutive and administrative functions . . . are carried out\u201d\nthere and \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d in Oklahoma City, Okla\nhoma; and that its \u201cmajor administrative operations . . .\nare found\u201d at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court of the Northern District of California\naccepted Hertz\u2019s statement of the facts as undisputed.\nBut it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi\nzen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court\napplied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to\nidentify a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d by\nfirst determining the amount of a corporation\u2019s business\nactivity State by State. If the amount of activity is \u201csig\nnificantly larger\u201d or \u201csubstantially predominates\u201d in one\nState, then that State is the corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\nof business.\u201d If there is no such State, then the \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d is the corporation\u2019s \u201c \u2018nerve center,\u2019 \u201d i.e.,\nthe place where \u201c \u2018the majority of its executive and admin\nistrative functions are performed.\u2019 \u201d Friend v. Hertz, No.\nC\u201307\u20135222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf\nter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi\nronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500\u2013502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).\n   Applying this test, the District Court found that the\n\u201cplurality of each of the relevant business activities\u201d was\nin California, and that \u201cthe differential between the\namount of those activities\u201d in California and the amount\nin \u201cthe next closest state\u201d was \u201csignificant.\u201d Order 4.\nHence, Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was Califor\nnia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The\nDistrict Court consequently remanded the case to the\nstate courts.\n   Hertz appealed the District Court\u2019s remand order. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief\nmemorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz\nfiled a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences\namong the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo\nrate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco\nCorp., supra, at 500\u2013502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.\nRussellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap\nplying \u201ctotal activity\u201d test and looking at \u201call corporate\nactivities\u201d), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282\n4                   HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(applying \u201cnerve center\u201d test).\n                               II\n   At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.\nRespondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz\nto appeal the District Court\u2019s remand order to the Court of\nAppeals, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71453(c), constitutes an exception to a\nmore general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are\n\u201cnot reviewable on appeal.\u201d \u00a71447(d). They add that the\nlanguage of \u00a71453(c) refers only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d\nnot to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if \u201ca\nfinal judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court of appeals \u201cis not\nissued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible 10-day\nextension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied.\u201d And respondents\ndraw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion\nthat Congress intended to permit review of a remand\norder only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court\n(at least not if, as here, this Court\u2019s grant of certiorari\ncomes after \u00a71453(c)\u2019s time period has elapsed).\n   This argument, however, makes far too much of too\nlittle. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic\nitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that\nanother statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518\nU. S. 651, 660\u2013661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n104\u2013105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat\nute gives this Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . .

This\nstatutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants\nthat yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., \u00a71254, 62 Stat.\n928; \u00a71, 43 Stat. 938\u2013939 (amending \u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157);\n\u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, \u00a76, 26 Stat. 828. This\nhistory provides particularly strong reasons not to read\n\u00a71453(c)\u2019s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or\nlimiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.\n    We thus interpret \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

See Aetna Casu\nalty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466\u2013467\n(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U.

The Constitution\nprovides that the \u201cjudicial Power shall extend\u201d to \u201cContro\nversies . . . between Citizens of different States.\u201d Art. III,\n\u00a72. This language, however, does not automatically confer\ndiversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it\nauthorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine\nthe scope of the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction within constitu\ntional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,\n233\u2013234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87913\"><a href=\"/opinion/87913/mayor-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (1868).\n   Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise\ndiversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary\nAct, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear\nsuits \u201cbetween a citizen of the State where the suit is\nbrought, and a citizen of another State.\u201d \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78.\nThe statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,\nChief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,\ndescribed a corporation as an \u201cinvisible, intangible, and\nartificial being\u201d which was \u201ccertainly not a citizen.\u201d Bank\nof United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But\nthe Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal\ncourts\u2019 diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the\ncorporation\u2019s shareholders were all citizens of a different\nState from the defendants, as \u201cthe term citizen ought to be\nunderstood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is\nused in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons\nwho come into court, in this case, under their corporate\nname.\u201d Id., at 91\u201392.\n   In Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n6                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held\nthat a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of\nthe State by which it had been created, and its citizenship\nfor jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at\n558\u2013559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti\nmore & Ohio R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1854), held that the\nreason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora\ntion was that, for the limited purpose of determining\ncorporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi\ncially) presume that a corporation\u2019s shareholders were\ncitizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327\u2013328.\nAnd it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325\u2013326. Whatever\nthe rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity\npurposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be\na citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73623, pp. 1\u20137 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\n   In 1928 this Court made clear that the \u201cstate of incorpo\nration\u201d rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora\ntion closely identified with State A could proceed in a\nfederal court located in that State as long as the corpora\ntion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps\na State where the corporation did no business at all. See\nBlack and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and\nYellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522\u2013525\n(refusing to question corporation\u2019s reincorporation motives\nand finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in\nCongress and those who testified before it pointed out that\nthis interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction\u2019s\nbasic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts\u2019 doors\nto those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice\nagainst out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d\nCong., 1st Sess., 2, 4\u20137 (1932). Through its choice of the\nState of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate\nfederal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal\ncourts\u2019 doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at\n4 (\u201cSince the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora\ntion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for\ncorporations to be incorporated in one State while they do\nbusiness in another. And there is no doubt but that it\noften occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have\nthe advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of\nlitigation\u201d). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4\u20135 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George\nW.

Mitchell (May\n24, 1930)) (citing a \u201ccommon practice for individuals to\nincorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of\ntaking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts\u201d).\nAlthough various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo\nrate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,\nS. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),\nnone of these proposals were enacted into law.\n   At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,\nmany judges began to believe those dockets contained too\nmany diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer\nence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports\nof the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and\nSpecial Meeting (Sept. 24\u201326 & Mar. 19\u201320, 1951), in\nH. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26\u201327 (1952).\nAnd on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on\nJurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.\nCommittee Rept.).\n   Among its observations, the committee found a general\nneed \u201cto prevent frauds and abuses\u201d with respect to juris\ndiction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against\neliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead\nit recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory\namendment that would make a corporation a citizen both\nof the State of its incorporation and any State from which\nit received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14\u2013\n8                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15 (requiring corporation to show that \u201cless than fifty per\ncent of its gross income was derived from business trans\nacted within the state where the Federal court is held\u201d).\nIf, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state\nlaw in state court) a corporation that received half or more\nof its gross income from California, that corporation would\nnot be able to remove the case to federal court, even if\nDelaware was its State of incorporation.\n   During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem\nbers circulated their report and attended circuit confer\nences at which federal judges discussed the report\u2019s rec\nommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee\nfiled a new report in September, in which it revised its\ncorporate citizenship recommendation. It now proposed\nthat \u201c \u2018a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state\nof its original creation . . .

In respect to the \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d proposal, he said that the relevant language\n\u201cha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d House Hear\nings 37. He added:\n    \u201cAll of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy\n    cases, and as I recall the cases\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t want\n    to be bound by this statement because I haven\u2019t them\n    before me\u2014I think the courts have generally taken\n    the view that where a corporation\u2019s interests are\n    rather widespread, the principal place of business is\n    an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is\n    the actual place where its business operations are co\n    ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or\n    dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its\n    day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,\n    where its payments are made, and not necessarily a\n    State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo\n    ration, or something of that sort.\n      \u201cBut that has been pretty well worked out in the\n    bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,\n    you see, to be applied here without having to go over it\n    again from the beginning.\u201d Ibid.\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference\nCommittee Reports along with other reports and relevant\ntestimony and circulated it to the general public \u201cfor the\npurpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.\u201d\nId., at III. Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified\nthe courts\u2019 traditional place of incorporation test and also\nenacted into law a slightly modified version of the Confer\nence Committee\u2019s proposed \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\nlanguage.

If a\ncorporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were in\nthe same State in which it did most of its business, the\ntest seemed straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.\nSilver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314\u2013315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con\nsultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat.

The test applied by our Court\n    of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an\n    \u2018office from which its business was directed and con\n    trolled\u2019\u2014the place where \u2018all of its business was under\n    the supreme direction and control of its officers.\u2019 \u201d\n    Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F.

For it\ndid not answer what courts should do when the operations\nof the corporation are not \u201cfar-flung\u201d but rather limited to\nonly a few States. When faced with this question, various\ncourts have focused more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s\nactual business activities are located. See, e.g., Diaz-\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60\u201361 (CA1\n2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v. Mushroom Makers, Inc., 612\nF. 2d 651, 656\u2013657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore\u2019s\n\u00a7102.54, at 102\u2013112.1.\n   Perhaps because corporations come in many different\nforms, involve many different kinds of business activities,\nand locate offices and plants for different reasons in differ\nent ways in different regions, a general \u201cbusiness activi\nties\u201d approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.\n12                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts must decide which factors are more important than\nothers: for example, plant location, sales or servicing\ncenters; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.\nSee, e.g., R. G. Barry Corp., supra, at 656\u2013657 (place of\nsales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees);\nDiaz-Rodriguez, supra, at 61\u201362 (place of stores and in\nventory, employees, income, and sales).\n   The number of factors grew as courts explicitly com\nbined aspects of the \u201cnerve center\u201d and \u201cbusiness activity\u201d\ntests to look to a corporation\u2019s \u201ctotal activities,\u201d sometimes\nto try to determine what treatises have described as the\ncorporation\u2019s \u201ccenter of gravity.\u201d See, e.g., Gafford v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 997 F. 2d 150, 162\u2013163 (CA6 1993);\nAmoco Rocmount Co. v. Anschutz Corp., 7 F. 3d 909, 915\n(CA10 1993); 13F Wright & Miller \u00a73625, at 100. A major\ntreatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit\nby Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha\nsize similar factors differently, and reporting that the\n\u201cfederal courts of appeals have employed various tests\u201d\u2014\ntests which \u201ctend to overlap\u201d and which are sometimes\ndescribed in \u201clanguage\u201d that \u201cis imprecise.\u201d 15 Moore\u2019s\n\u00a7102.54[2], at 102\u2013112.

Not surprisingly, differ\nent circuits (and sometimes different courts within a\nsingle circuit) have applied these highly general multifac\ntor tests in different ways.

Peck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87055\"><a href=\"/opinion/87055/pease-v-peck/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599\n(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.\nAfter all, the relevant purposive concern\u2014prejudice\nagainst an out-of-state party\u2014will often depend upon\nfactors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a\ncorporation\u2019s image, its history, and its advertising, while\nthe factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam\nple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or\nthe nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some\ntimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli\nhood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at\nwar with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to\nachieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,\nan unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation\nof the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of\nAppeals\u2019 divergent and increasingly complex interpreta\n14                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,\nJudge Weinfeld\u2019s approach, as applied in the Seventh\nCircuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at\n865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con\nclude that \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is best read as\nreferring to the place where a corporation\u2019s officers direct,\ncontrol, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities. It is\nthe place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora\ntion\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d And in practice it should normally\nbe the place where the corporation maintains its head\nquarters\u2014provided that the headquarters is the actual\ncenter of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the\n\u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpora\ntion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by\ndirectors and officers who have traveled there for the\noccasion).\n   Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us\nthat this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other\npossibilities. First, the statute\u2019s language supports the\napproach. The statute\u2019s text deems a corporation a citizen\nof the \u201cState where it has its principal place of business. \u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)(1).           The word \u201cplace\u201d is\nin the singular, not the plural. The word \u201cprincipal\u201d re\nquires us to pick out the \u201cmain, prominent\u201d or \u201cleading\u201d\nplace. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.\n168, 174 (1993) (interpreting \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\nfor tax purposes to require an assessment of \u201cwhether any\none business location is the \u2018most important, consequen\ntial, or influential\u2019 one\u201d). And the fact that the word\n\u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState where\u201d means that the\n\u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.\n   A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main head\nquarters, is a single place. The public often (though not\nalways) considers it the corporation\u2019s main place of busi\nness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of a more general business activities test has\nled some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a\nparticular place within a State, but incorrectly at the\nState itself, measuring the total amount of business activi\nties that the corporation conducts there and determining\nwhether they are \u201csignificantly larger\u201d than in the next\nranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.\n   This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to\nstrange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.\nNamely, if a \u201ccorporation may be deemed a citizen of\nCalifornia on th[e] basis\u201d of \u201cactivities [that] roughly\nreflect California\u2019s larger population . . . nearly every\nnational retailer\u2014no matter how far flung its operations\u2014\nwill be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur\nposes.\u201d Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,\n1029\u20131030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity\njurisdiction on the basis of a State\u2019s population, whether\nmeasured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with\nmodifications?\n   Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375\n(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing\n\u201cthe sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the\narea of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible\u201d).\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of\ntheir claims, but which court is the right court to decide\nthose claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.\n458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish\nthe likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a\nclaim\u2019s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are\nat stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de\ntermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nwhen no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil\n16                HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCo., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,\nat 514.\n   Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict\nability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making\nbusiness and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City\nBank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462\nU. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the \u201cneed for certainty\nand predictability of result while generally protecting the\njustified expectations of parties with interests in the cor\nporation\u201d). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding\nwhether to file suit in a state or federal court.\n   A \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates\nthat \u201ccenter\u201d with a corporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple\nto apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor\nporate \u201cbrain,\u201d while not precise, suggests a single loca\ntion. By contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activi\nties more often lack a single principal place where they\ntake place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev\neral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in\nmany different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de\ntermine which of these different business locales is the\n\u201cprincipal\u201d or most important \u201cplace.\u201d\n   Third, the statute\u2019s legislative history, for those who\naccept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench\nmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version\nof its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora\ntion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted\nfor more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee\nRept. 14\u201315; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its\nmind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too\ncomplex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.\n2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That\nhistory suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of busi\nness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe initial \u201chalf of gross income\u201d test. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test\noffers such a possibility. A general business activities test\ndoes not.\n                                 B\n   We recognize that there may be no perfect test that\nsatisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We\nrecognize as well that, under the \u201cnerve center\u201d test we\nadopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this\nera of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their\ncommand and coordinating functions among officers who\nwork at several different locations, perhaps communicat\ning over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless\npoints courts in a single direction, towards the center of\noverall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not\nhave to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve\nnues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach\nprovides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,\nnot a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener\nate a result.\n   We also recognize that the use of a \u201cnerve center\u201d test\nmay in some cases produce results that seem to cut\nagainst the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, see su\npra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company\u2019s business\nactivities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,\nwhile its top officers direct those activities just across the\nriver in New York, the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is New\nYork. One could argue that members of the public in New\nJersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the\ncorporation than persons in New York\u2014yet the corpora\ntion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case\nto federal court. And note too that the same corporation\nwould be unable to remove a New York state case to fed\neral court, despite the New York public\u2019s presumed preju\ndice against the corporation.\n   We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.\n18                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHowever, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,\nwe must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin\ntuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to\navoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while\nproducing the benefits that accompany a more uniform\nlegal system.\n   The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity\njurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance\nCorp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &\nMiller \u00a73602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of\njurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega\ntions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15\nMoore\u2019s \u00a7102.14, at 102\u201332 to 102\u201332.1. And when faced\nwith such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere\nfiling of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis\nsion\u2019s Form 10\u2013K listing a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal execu\ntive offices\u201d would, without more, be sufficient proof to\nestablish a corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d See, e.g., SEC\nForm 10\u2013K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan\ncial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190\u20131192 (CA7\n1986) (distinguishing \u201cprincipal executive office\u201d in the tax\nlien context, see 26 U. S. C. \u00a76323(f)(2), from \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)). Such possi\nbilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,\nthereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d language in the diversity\nstatute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu\nlation\u2014for example, that the alleged \u201cnerve center\u201d is\nnothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a\ncomputer, or the location of an annual executive retreat\u2014\nthe courts should instead take as the \u201cnerve center\u201d the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplace of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the\nabsence of such manipulation.\n                             VI\n  Petitioner\u2019s unchallenged declaration suggests that\nHertz\u2019s center of direction, control, and coordination, its\n\u201cnerve center,\u201d and its corporate headquarters are one and\nthe same, and they are located in New Jersey, not in\nCalifornia. Because respondents should have a fair op-\nportunity to litigate their case in light of our holding,\nhowever, we vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
