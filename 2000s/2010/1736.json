Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                          FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n No. 08\u20131175. Argued December 7, 2009\u2014Decided February 23, 2010\nIn a pathmarking decision, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 471, this\n  Court held that an individual must be \u201cclearly informed,\u201d prior to\n  custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to\n  consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n  rogation.\u201d\n    After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him,\n  Tampa Police read him their standard Miranda form, stating, inter\n  alia: \u201cYou have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of\n  our questions\u201d and \u201c[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at\n  any time you want during this interview.\u201d Powell then admitted he\n  owned a handgun found in a police search. He was charged with pos\n  session of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.\n  The trial court denied Powell\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory\n  statements, which was based on the contention that the Miranda\n  warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the pres\n  ence of an attorney during questioning. Powell was convicted of the\n  gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that\n  the trial court should have suppressed the statements. The Florida\n  Supreme Court agreed. It noted that both Miranda and the State\n  Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to\n  have a lawyer present during questioning. The advice Powell re\n  ceived was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that\n  he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to\n  question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsel\u2019s presence\n  throughout the interrogation.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case. Powell contends\n that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied\n on the State\u2019s Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision\n2                          FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rested on an adequate and independent state ground. See Coleman\n    v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n    1032, 1040\u20131041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears\n    to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,\n    and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground\n    is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that fed\n    eral law controlled the state court\u2019s decision. Although invoking Flor\n    ida\u2019s Constitution and precedent in addition to this Court\u2019s decisions,\n    the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave\n    Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\n    Miranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044. The state-court opinion con\n    sistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what\n    Florida law independently requires. This Court therefore cannot\n    identify, \u201cfrom the face of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the de\n    cision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See Long,\n    463 U. S., at 1041. Because the opinion does not \u201cindicat[e] clearly\n    and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate,\n    adequate, and independent [state] grounds,\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at 1041,\n    this Court has jurisdiction. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       2. Advice that a suspect has \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\n    answering any of [the law enforcement officers\u2019] questions,\u201d and that\n    he can invoke this right \u201cat any time . . . during th[e] interview,\u201d sat\n    isfies Miranda. Pp. 7\u201313.\n          (a) Miranda requires that a suspect \u201cbe warned prior to any\n    questioning . . . that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d\n    384 U. S., at 479. This Miranda warning addresses the Court\u2019s par\n    ticular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody in\n    terrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one\n    merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interro\n    gators.\u201d Id., at 469. Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as\n    \u201can absolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual held\n    for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to\n    consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n    rogation.\u201d Id., at 471. While the warnings prescribed by Miranda\n    are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the es\n    sential information must be conveyed. See, e.g., California v. Pry\n    sock, 453 U. S. 355, 359. In determining whether police warnings\n    were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to \u201cexamine\n    [them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.\n    The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to\n    [a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth v.\n    Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203. Pp. 7\u20139.\n          (b) The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard. By in\n    forming Powell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before an\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  swering any of [their] questions,\u201d the Tampa officers communicated\n  that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular\n  question. And the statement that Powell had \u201cthe right to use any of\n  [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview\u201d con\n  firmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the inter\n  rogation was underway. In combination, the two warnings reasona\n  bly conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the\n  outset of interrogation, but at all times. To reach the opposite con\n  clusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the\n  interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive\n  and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be\n  obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each\n  query. Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclu\n  sion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language\n  that Powell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the offi\n  cers\u2019] questions\u201d suggested he could consult with an attorney only be\n  fore the interrogation started. In context, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely\n  conveyed that Powell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective before he\n  answered any questions at all. Nothing in the words used indicated\n  that counsel\u2019s presence would be restricted after the questioning\n  commenced. Powell suggests that today\u2019s holding will tempt law en\n  forcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings\n  to introduce ambiguity. But, as the Federal Government explains, it\n  is in law enforcement\u2019s own interest to state warnings with maxi\n  mum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the\n  advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspect\u2019s statement. The\n  standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are\n  admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise\n  formulation necessary to meet Miranda\u2019s requirements. Different\n  words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communi\n  cated the same message.

Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436, 471 (1966), the Court held that an individual\nmust be \u201cclearly informed,\u201d prior to custodial questioning,\nthat he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to consult with\na lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interro\ngation.\u201d The question presented in this case is whether\nadvice that a suspect has \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer\nbefore answering any of [the law enforcement officers\u2019]\nquestions,\u201d and that he can invoke this right \u201cat any time\n. . . during th[e] interview,\u201d satisfies Miranda. We hold\nthat it does.\n                            I\n  On August 10, 2004, law enforcement officers in Tampa,\nFlorida, seeking to apprehend respondent Kevin Dewayne\nPowell in connection with a robbery investigation, entered\nan apartment rented by Powell\u2019s girlfriend. 969 So. 2d\n1060, 1063 (Fla. App. 2007). After spotting Powell coming\nfrom a bedroom, the officers searched the room and dis\ncovered a loaded nine-millimeter handgun under the bed.\nIbid.\n  The officers arrested Powell and transported him to the\n2                    FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTampa Police headquarters. Ibid. Once there, and before\nasking Powell any questions, the officers read Powell the\nstandard Tampa Police Department Consent and Release\nForm 310. Id., at 1063\u20131064. The form states:\n    \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. If you give up\n    the right to remain silent, anything you say can be\n    used against you in court. You have the right to talk\n    to a lawyer before answering any of our questions. If\n    you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be ap\n    pointed for you without cost and before any question\n    ing. You have the right to use any of these rights at\n    any time you want during this interview.\u201d App. 3.\n    See also 969 So. 2d, at 1064.\n   Acknowledging that he had been informed of his rights,\nthat he \u201cunderst[oo]d them,\u201d and that he was \u201cwilling to\ntalk\u201d to the officers, Powell signed the form. App. 3. He\nthen admitted that he owned the handgun found in the\napartment. Powell knew he was prohibited from possess\ning a gun because he had previously been convicted of a\nfelony, but said he had nevertheless purchased and car\nried the firearm for his protection. See 969 So. 2d, at\n1064; App. 29.\n   Powell was charged in state court with possession of a\nweapon by a prohibited possessor, in violation of Fla. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a7790.23(1) (West 2007).          Contending that the\nMiranda warnings were deficient because they did not\nadequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney\nduring questioning, he moved to suppress his inculpatory\nstatements. The trial court denied the motion, concluding\nthat the officers had properly notified Powell of his right to\ncounsel. 969 So. 2d, at 1064; App. 28. A jury convicted\nPowell of the gun-possession charge. 969 So. 2d, at 1064.\n   On appeal, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal\nheld that the trial court should have suppressed Powell\u2019s\nstatements. Id., at 1067. The Miranda warnings, the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The court\nfound that the advice Powell received was misleading\nbecause it suggested that Powell could \u201conly consult with\nan attorney before questioning\u201d and did not convey Pow\nell\u2019s entitlement to counsel\u2019s presence throughout the\ninterrogation. Id., at 541. Nor, in the court\u2019s view, did the\nfinal catchall warning\u2014\u201c[y]ou have the right to use any of\nthese rights at any time you want during this interview\u201d\u2014\ncure the defect the court perceived in the right-to-counsel\nadvice: \u201cThe catch-all phrase did not supply the missing\nwarning of the right to have counsel present during police\nquestioning,\u201d the court stated, for \u201ca right that has never\nbeen expressed cannot be reiterated.\u201d Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Article I, \u00a79 of the Florida Constitution states that \u201c[n]o person shall\n\n. . . be compelled in any criminal matter to be a witness against one\nself.\u201d\n4                    FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Justice Wells dissented. He considered it \u201cunreasonable\nto conclude that the broad, unqualified language read to\nPowell would lead a person of ordinary intelligence to\nbelieve that he or she had a limited right to consult with\nan attorney that could only be exercised before answering\nthe first question posed by law enforcement.\u201d Id., at 544.\nThe final sentence of the warning, he stressed, \u201cavoid[ed]\nthe implication\u2014unreasonable as it may [have] be[en]\u2014\nthat advice concerning the right of access to counsel before\nquestioning conveys the message that access to counsel is\nforeclosed during questioning.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).       Criticizing the majority\u2019s \u201ctechnical\nadherence to language . . . that has no connection with\nwhether the person who confessed understood his or her\nrights,\u201d id., at 545, he concluded that \u201c[t]he totality of the\nwarning reasonably conveyed to Powell his continuing\nright of access to counsel,\u201d id., at 544.\n  We granted certiorari, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\nreverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n                             II\n   We first address Powell\u2019s contention that this Court\nlacks jurisdiction to hear this case because the Florida\nSupreme Court, by relying not only on Miranda but also\non the Florida Constitution, rested its decision on an\nadequate and independent state ground. Brief for Peti\ntioner 15\u201323. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n729 (1991) (\u201cThis Court will not review a question of fed\neral law decided by a state court if the decision . . . rests\non a state law ground that is independent of the federal\nquestion and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d). \u201cIt is\nfundamental,\u201d we have observed, \u201cthat state courts be left\nfree and unfettered by us in interpreting their state con\nstitutions.\u201d Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309 U. S. 551,\n557 (1940). \u201cBut it is equally important that ambiguous or\nobscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbarriers to a determination by this Court of the validity\nunder the federal constitution of state action.\u201d Ibid.\n  To that end, we announced, in Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983), the following presumption:\n     \u201c[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to\n     rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with\n     the federal law, and when the adequacy and inde\n     pendence of any possible state law ground is not clear\n     from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the\n     most reasonable explanation that the state court de\n     cided the case the way it did because it believed that\n     federal law required it to do so.\u201d\nAt the same time, we adopted a plain-statement rule to\navoid the presumption: \u201cIf the state court decision indi\ncates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on\nbona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds,\nwe, of course, will not undertake to review the decision.\u201d\nId., at 1041.2\n   Under the Long presumption, we have jurisdiction to\nentertain this case. Although invoking Florida\u2019s Constitu\ntion and precedent in addition to this Court\u2019s decisions,\nthe Florida Supreme Court treated state and federal law\nas interchangeable and interwoven; the court at no point\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Dissenting  in Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), JUSTICE\nSTEVENS did not urge, as he now does, inspection of state-court deci\nsions to count the number of citations to state and federal provisions\nand opinions, or heroic efforts to fathom what the state court really\nmeant. See post, at 3\u20137 (dissenting opinion). Instead, his preferred\napproach was as clear as the Court\u2019s. In lieu of \u201cpresuming that\nadequate state grounds are not independent unless it clearly appears\notherwise,\u201d he would have \u201cpresum[ed] that adequate state grounds are\nindependent unless it clearly appears otherwise.\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at\n1066; see post, at 2, n. 1. Either presumption would avoid arduous\nefforts to detect, case by case, whether a state ground of decision is\ntruly \u201cindependent of the [state court\u2019s] understanding of federal law.\u201d\nLong, 463 U. S., at 1066. Today, however, the dissent would require\nthis Court to engage in just that sort of inquiry.\n6                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexpressly asserted that state-law sources gave Powell\nrights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\nMiranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.\n   Beginning with the certified question\u2014whether the\nadvice the Tampa police gave to Powell \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (some capitalization omit\nted)\u2014and continuing throughout its opinion, the Florida\nSupreme Court trained on what Miranda demands, rather\nthan on what Florida law independently requires. See,\ne.g., 998 So. 2d, at 533 (\u201cThe issue before this Court is\nwhether the failure to provide express advice of the right\nto the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation\nviolates the principles espoused in Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436.\u201d); id., at 538 (\u201c[T]he issue of [what] Miranda\nrequires . . . has been addressed by several of the Florida\ndistrict courts of appeal.\u201d); id., at 542 (Powell received a\n\u201cnarrower and less functional warning than that required\nby Miranda.\u201d).3 We therefore cannot identify, \u201cfrom the\nface of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the decision\nrested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See\nLong, 463 U.

S., at 441\u2013442, Miranda prescribed the\nfollowing four now-familiar warnings:\n    \u201c[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning\n    [1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that any\n    thing he says can be used against him in a court of\n    law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an at\n    torney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney\n    one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning\n    if he so desires.\u201d Id., at 479.\n   Miranda\u2019s third warning\u2014the only one at issue here\u2014\naddresses our particular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances\nsurrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very\nquickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of\nhis privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.\u201d Id.,\nat 469. Responsive to that concern, we stated, as \u201can\nabsolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual\nheld for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has\nthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer\nwith him during interrogation.\u201d Id., at 471. The question\nbefore us is whether the warnings Powell received satis\nfied this requirement.\n   The four warnings Miranda requires are invariable, but\nthis Court has not dictated the words in which the essen\ntial information must be conveyed. See California v.\nPrysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam) (\u201cThis\nCourt has never indicated that the rigidity of Miranda\nextends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a\ncriminal defendant.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nRhode Island v.

In determining whether\npolice officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we\nhave said, reviewing courts are not required to examine\nthe words employed \u201cas if construing a will or defining the\nterms of an easement. The inquiry is simply whether the\nwarnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as\nrequired by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 203\n(quoting Prysock, 453 U. S., at 361).\n                              B\n    Our decisions in Prysock and Duckworth inform our\njudgment here. Both concerned a suspect\u2019s entitlement to\nadequate notification of the right to appointed counsel. In\nPrysock, an officer informed the suspect of, inter alia, his\nright to a lawyer\u2019s presence during questioning and his\nright to counsel appointed at no cost. 453 U. S., at 356\u2013\n357. The Court of Appeals held the advice inadequate to\ncomply with Miranda because it lacked an express state\nment that the appointment of an attorney would occur\nprior to the impending interrogation. See 453 U. S., at\n358\u2013359. We reversed. Id., at 362. \u201c[N]othing in the\nwarnings,\u201d we observed, \u201csuggested any limitation on the\nright to the presence of appointed counsel different from\nthe clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general, includ\ning the right to a lawyer before [the suspect is] questioned,\n. . . while [he is] being questioned, and all during the\nquestioning.\u201d Id., at 360\u2013361 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n    Similarly, in Duckworth, we upheld advice that, in\nrelevant part, communicated the right to have an attorney\npresent during the interrogation and the right to an ap\npointed attorney, but also informed the suspect that the\nlawyer would be appointed \u201cif and when [the suspect goes]\nto court.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201cThe Court of Appeals thought\nth[e] \u2018if and when you go to court\u2019 language suggested that\n10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nonly those accused who can afford an attorney have the\nright to have one present before answering any ques\ntions. \u201d Id., at 203 (some internal quotation marks omit\nted). We thought otherwise. Under the relevant state\nlaw, we noted, \u201ccounsel is appointed at [a] defendant\u2019s\ninitial appearance in court.\u201d Id., at 204. The \u201cif and when\nyou go to court\u201d advice, we said, \u201csimply anticipate[d]\u201d a\nquestion the suspect might be expected to ask after receiv\ning Miranda warnings, i.e., \u201cwhen [will he] obtain coun\nsel.\u201d 492 U. S., at 204. Reading the \u201cif and when\u201d lan\nguage together with the other information conveyed, we\nheld that the warnings, \u201cin their totality, satisfied\nMiranda.\u201d Id., at 205.\n   We reach the same conclusion in this case. The Tampa\nofficers did not \u201centirely omi[t],\u201d post, at 9, any informa\ntion Miranda required them to impart. They informed\nPowell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\nanswering any of [their] questions\u201d and \u201cthe right to use\nany of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e]\ninterview.\u201d App. 3. The first statement communicated\nthat Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering\nany particular question, and the second statement con\nfirmed that he could exercise that right while the interro\ngation was underway. In combination, the two warnings\nreasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an attorney\npresent, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all\ntimes.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the Court today approves, for \u201cthe\n\nfirst time[,] . . . a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely\nomitted an essential element of a suspect\u2019s rights.\u201d Post, at 9. See also\npost, at 12 (\u201c[T]he warning entirely failed to inform [Powell] of the\nseparate and distinct right \u2018to have counsel present during any ques\ntioning.\u2019 \u201d). We find the warning in this case adequate, however, only\nbecause it communicated just what Miranda prescribed. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS ascribes a different meaning to the warning Powell received,\nbut he cannot credibly suggest that the Court regards the warning to\nhave omitted a vital element of Powell\u2019s rights.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney\nwould not be present throughout the interrogation, the\nsuspect would have to imagine an unlikely scenario: To\nconsult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter\nthe interrogation room between each query. A reasonable\nsuspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his\nrights, we believe, would not come to the counterintuitive\nconclusion that he is obligated, or allowed, to hop in and\nout of the holding area to seek his attorney\u2019s advice.6\nInstead, the suspect would likely assume that he must\nstay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer\nwould be there with him the entire time.7\n   The Florida Supreme Court found the warning mislead\ning because it believed the temporal language\u2014that Pow\nell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d\u2014suggested Powell could consult with\nan attorney only before the interrogation started. 998\nSo. 2d, at 541. See also Brief for Respondent 28\u201329. In\ncontext, however, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely conveyed when\nPowell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective\u2014namely,\nbefore he answered any questions at all. Nothing in the\nwords used indicated that counsel\u2019s presence would be\nrestricted after the questioning commenced. Instead, the\nwarning communicated that the right to counsel carried\nforward to and through the interrogation: Powell could\nseek his attorney\u2019s advice before responding to \u201cany of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d and \u201cat any time . . . during th[e]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 It is equally unlikely that the suspect would anticipate a scenario of\n\nthis order: His lawyer would be admitted into the interrogation room\neach time the police ask him a question, then ushered out each time the\nsuspect responds.\n  7 Although it does not bear on our decision, Powell seems to have\n\nunderstood the warning this way. The following exchange between\nPowell and his attorney occurred when Powell testified at his trial:\n  \u201cQ. You waived the right to have an attorney present during your\nquestioning by detectives; is that what you\u2019re telling this jury?\n  \u201cA. Yes.\u201d App. 80.\n12                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterview.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Although the warn\nings were not the clearest possible formulation of\nMiranda\u2019s right-to-counsel advisement, they were suffi\nciently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a\ncommonsense reading.\n   Pursuing a different line of argument, Powell points out\nthat most jurisdictions in Florida and across the Nation\nexpressly advise suspects of the right to have counsel\npresent both before and during interrogation. Brief for\nRespondent 41\u201344. If we find the advice he received ade\nquate, Powell suggests, law enforcement agencies, hoping\nto obtain uninformed waivers, will be tempted to end-run\nMiranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambi\nguity. Brief for Respondent 50\u201353. But as the United\nStates explained as amicus curiae in support of the State\nof Florida, \u201claw enforcement agencies have little reason to\nassume the litigation risk of experimenting with novel\nMiranda formulations,\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6; instead, it is \u201cdesirable police practice\u201d and \u201cin\nlaw enforcement\u2019s own interest\u201d to state warnings with\nmaximum clarity, id., at 12.

The Court\u2019s power to review that\ndecision is doubtful at best; moreover, the Florida Su\npreme Court has the better view on the merits.\n                             I\n  In this case, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that\n\u201c[b]oth Miranda and article I, section 9 of the Florida\nConstitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of\nthe right to have a lawyer present during questioning,\u201d\nand that the warnings given to Powell did not satisfy\neither the State or the Federal Constitution. 998 So. 2d\n531, 542 (2008). In my view, the Florida Supreme Court\nheld on an adequate and independent state-law ground\nthat the warnings provided to Powell did not sufficiently\ninform him of the \u201c \u2018right to a lawyer\u2019s help\u2019 \u201d under the\nFlorida Constitution, id., at 535. This Court therefore\nlacks jurisdiction to review the judgment below, notwith\nstanding the failure of that court to include some express\nsentence that would satisfy this Court\u2019s \u201cplain-statement\nrule,\u201d ante, at 5.\n  The adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine\nrests on two \u201ccornerstones\u201d: \u201c[r]espect for the independ\n2                       FLORIDA v.

S. 1032, 1040 (1983).\nIn Long, the Court adopted a novel presumption in favor\nof jurisdiction when the independence of a state court\u2019s\nstate-law judgment is not clear. But we only respect the\nindependence of state courts and avoid rendering advisory\nopinions if we limit the application of that presumption to\ntruly ambiguous cases.1 This is not such a case.\n  \u201c[I]f the same judgment would be rendered by the state\ncourt after we corrected its views of federal laws, our\nreview could amount to nothing more than an advisory\nopinion.\u201d Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 126 (1945). In\nLong we advised every state court of a formula by which it\ncould assure us that our review would indeed amount to\nnothing more than an advisory opinion. The state court\n\u201cneed only make clear by a plain statement in its judg\nment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only\nfor the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel\nthe result that the court has reached.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1041.\nThat advice has sometimes been misunderstood as a com\nmand that unless such a plain statement is included in a\nstate-court opinion, the court\u2019s ruling cannot have rested\non an adequate and independent state ground. But the\nreal question is whether \u201cthe adequacy and independence\nof any possible state law ground is . . . clear from the face\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In my view, this Court would better respect the independence of\n\nstate courts by applying the opposite presumption, as it did in the years\nprior to 1983. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1066\u20131067 (STEVENS, J., dissent\ning). But accepting Long as the law, we can limit its negative effects\u2014\nunnecessary intrusion into the business of the state courts and unnec\nessary advisory opinions\u2014only if we limit its application to cases in\nwhich the independence of the state-law ground is in serious doubt.\nSee Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 950 (1996) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he unfortunate effects of [its] rule\u201d are \u201cexacerbate[d]\n. . . to a nearly intolerable degree\u201d when the Long presumption is\napplied to cases in which \u201cthe state-law ground supporting th[e] judg\nmen[t] is so much clearer than has been true on most prior occasions\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Even if a state court\nopinion does not include the magic words set forth in\nLong, or some similarly explicit sentence, we lack jurisdic\ntion if it is nonetheless apparent that the decision is in\ndeed supported by an adequate and independent state\nground. Contrary to the assumption made by the Court,\nwe have no power to assume jurisdiction that does not\notherwise exist simply because the Florida Supreme Court\ndid not include in its decision some express statement that\nits interpretation of state law is independent.\n   In my view, we can tell from the face of the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe decision rested on a\nstate ground separate from Miranda,\u201d ante, at 6. This\ncase is easily distinguished from Long in that regard. In\nLong, although the Michigan Supreme Court had twice\ncited the Michigan Constitution in its opinion, it \u201crelied\nexclusively on its understanding of Terry [v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968),] and other federal cases. Not a single state\ncase was cited to support the state court\u2019s holding that the\nsearch of the passenger compartment was unconstitu\ntional.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1043. There was, in short, nothing\nto \u201cindicate that the decision below rested on grounds in\nany way independent from the state court\u2019s interpretation\nof federal law.\u201d Id., at 1044.\n   Other cases in which we have applied the Long pre\nsumption have been similarly devoid of independent state\nlaw analysis. We typically apply the Long presumption\nwhen the state court\u2019s decision cited a state constitutional\nprovision only a few times or not at all, and rested exclu\nsively upon federal cases or upon state cases that them\nselves cited only federal law.2 We have also applied Long\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See, e.g., Illinois v.

Labron, 543 Pa. 86, 100, 669 A. 2d 917, 924 (1995), was\nnot so clearly based on state law that the Long presumption did not\napply, even though only \u201csome\u201d of the state cases discussed in the state\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

I, \u00a79 of the Florida\nConstitution. For example, after a paragraph describing\nthe general scope of Miranda warnings under federal law,\nthe Court explained the general scope of warnings under\nstate law. 998 So. 2d, at 534\u2013535 (\u201c[T]o ensure the volun\ntariness of confessions as required by article I, section 9 of\nthe Florida Constitution, this Court in Traylor v. State,\n596 So. 2d 957 (Fla. 1992), outlined the . . . rights Florida\nsuspects must be told of prior to custodial interrogation,\u201d\nwhich includes \u201c \u2018that they have a right to a lawyer\u2019s\nhelp\u2019 \u201d). The court consistently referred to these state-law\nrights as separate and distinct from Miranda, noting that\nin its earlier cases, it had explained that \u201cthe require\nments of both the Fifth Amendment, as explained in\nMiranda, and the Florida Constitution, as explained in\nTraylor,\u201d include \u201cthe requirement that a suspect be in\nformed of the right to have counsel present during ques\ntioning.\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 537\u2013538. And when applying the\nlaw to the specific facts of this case, the Florida Supreme\nCourt again invoked the specific and distinct \u201cright to a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourt\u2019s opinion analyzed federal law. 518 U. S., at 939. The Court\u2019s\nanalysis proved wrong; on remand, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\nreaffirmed its prior holding and \u201cexplicitly note[d] that it was, in fact,\ndecided upon independent grounds, i.e., Article I, Section 8 of the\nPennsylvania Constitution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Labron, 547 Pa. 344,\n345, 690 A. 2d 228 (1997). That we have overreached before is no\nreason to repeat the mistake again.\n   5 In examining what the state-court opinion said regarding state law,\n\nand whether the state precedent cited in the opinion relied upon state\nlaw, I am undertaking no effort more arduous than what the Court has\ntypically undertaken in order to determine whether the Long presump\ntion applies: examining how frequently a state-court opinion cited state\nlaw, whether state law is coextensive with federal law, and whether the\ncited state cases relied upon federal law. See nn. 2\u20133, supra.\n6                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlawyer\u2019s help\u201d under the Florida Constitution. Id., at 540.\n   Moreover, the state cases relied upon by the Florida\nSupreme Court did not themselves rely exclusively on\nfederal law. The primary case relied upon for the state\nlaw holding, Traylor, rested exclusively upon state law.\nSee 596 So. 2d, at 961. In that decision, the Florida Su\npreme Court embraced the principle that \u201c[w]hen called\nupon to decide matters of fundamental rights, Florida\u2019s\nstate courts are bound under federalist principles to give\nprimacy to our state Constitution and to give independent\nlegal import to every phrase and clause contained\ntherein.\u201d Id., at 962. Elaborating upon the meaning of\nArt. I, \u00a79 of the Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme\nCourt explained the roots of Florida\u2019s commitment to\nprotecting its citizens from self-incrimination. Florida has\nlong \u201crequired as a matter of state law that one charged\nwith a crime be informed of his rights prior to rendering a\nconfession.\u201d Id., at 964. It has required warnings before\nsome interrogations since at least 1889, and has for that\nlong excluded confessions obtained in violation of those\nrules. Ibid. In sum, this case looks quite different from\nthose cases in which we have applied the Long presump\ntion in the past.\n   The Court concludes otherwise by relying primarily\nupon the formulation of the certified question and re\nstatements of that question within the Florida Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinion. See ante, at 6. Yet while the certified\nquestion asks whether particular phrases \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda warnings,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (capitalization and\nfootnote omitted), Miranda has become a generic term to\nrefer to the warnings suspects must be given before inter\nrogation, see Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 792\n(11th ed. 2003) (defining \u201cMiranda\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or\nbeing the legal rights of an arrested person to have an\nattorney and to remain silent so as to avoid self\nincrimination\u201d). Thus, its invocation of Miranda in the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncertified question and in its statement of the issue\npresented is entirely consistent with the fact that the\nstate-law basis for its decision is fully adequate and\nindependent.\n   That said, I agree with the Court that the decision below\nis interwoven with federal law. In reaching its state-law\nholding, the Florida Supreme Court found Miranda and\nour other precedents instructive.6 But that alone is insuf\nficient to assure our jurisdiction, even under Long. In my\nview, the judgment\u2014reversal of Powell\u2019s conviction\u2014is\nsupported by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s independent\nand carefully considered holding that these warnings were\ninadequate under the Florida Constitution. See 998\nSo. 2d, at 534\u2013535, 537\u2013538, 540, 542.\n   The Court acknowledges that nothing in today\u2019s decision\n\u201ctrenches on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s authority to\nimpose, based on the State\u2019s Constitution, any additional\nprotections against coerced confessions it deems appropri\nate.\u201d Ante, at 7. As the Florida Supreme Court has noted\non more than one occasion, its interpretation of the Flor\nida Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination need\nnot track our construction of the parallel provision in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Florida Supreme Court need not have decided that state-law\n\nsources \u201cgave Powell rights . . . broader than . . . those delineated in\nMiranda,\u201d ante, at 6, in order for its judgment to have rested upon an\nindependent state-law ground. The independence of a state-law ground\nmay be especially clear when a state court explicitly finds that the state\nconstitution is more protective of a certain right than the national\ncharter, but a state constitutional provision is no less independent for\nproviding the same protection in a given case as does the federal\nprovision, so long as the content of the state-law right is not compelled\nby or dependent upon federal law. Unlike other provisions of Art. I of\nthe Florida Constitution, \u00a79 does not contain an express proviso requir\ning that the right be construed in conformity with the analogous federal\nprovision. Compare Fla. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, with Fla. Const., Art I, \u00a712.\nFurthermore, under Florida law the scope of Art. I, \u00a79 is clearly not\ndependent upon federal law. Rigterink v. State, 2 So. 3d 221, 241 (Fla.\n2009); Traylor v. State, 596 So. 2d 957, 962 (Fla. 1992).\n8                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nFederal Constitution. See Rigterink v. State, 2 So. 3d 221,\n241 (2009) (\u201c[T]he federal Constitution sets the floor, not\nthe ceiling, and this Court retains the ability to interpret\nthe right against self-incrimination afforded by the Florida\nConstitution more broadly than that afforded by its fed\neral counterpart\u201d); Traylor, 596 So. 2d, at 961\u2013963. In this\nvery case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its\njudgment upon remand. If the Florida Supreme Court\ndoes so, as I expect it will, this Court\u2019s opinion on the\nmerits will qualify as the sort of advisory opinion that we\nshould studiously seek to avoid.\n                             II\n  The Court\u2019s decision on the merits is also unpersuasive.\nAs we recognized in Miranda, \u201cthe right to have counsel\npresent at [an] interrogation is indispensable to the pro\ntection of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436, 469 (1966). Furthermore, \u201cthe\nneed for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege\ncomprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel\nprior to questioning, but also to have counsel present\nduring any questioning.\u201d Id., at 470. Because the \u201cac\ncused who does not know his rights and therefore does not\nmake a request may be the person who most needs coun\nsel,\u201d id., at 470\u2013471, a defendant \u201cmust be clearly in\nformed\u201d regarding two aspects of his right to consult an\nattorney: \u201cthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have\nthe lawyer with him during interrogation,\u201d id., at 471.\n  In this case, the form regularly used by the Tampa\npolice warned Powell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a\nlawyer before answering any of our questions.\u201d App. 3.\nThis informed him only of the right to consult with a\nlawyer before questioning, the very right the Miranda\nCourt identified as insufficient to protect the Fifth\nAmendment privilege. The warning did not say anything\nabout the right to have counsel present during interroga\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion. Although we have never required \u201crigidity in the\nform of the required warnings,\u201d California v. Prysock, 453\nU. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam), this is, I believe, the\nfirst time the Court has approved a warning which, if\ngiven its natural reading, entirely omitted an essential\nelement of a suspect\u2019s rights.\n   Despite the failure of the warning to mention it, in the\nCourt\u2019s view the warning \u201creasonably conveyed\u201d to Powell\nthat he had the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence during the\ninterrogation. Ante, at 10. The Court cobbles together\nthis conclusion from two elements of the warning. First,\nthe Court assumes the warning regarding Powell\u2019s right\n\u201cto talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\u2019]\nquestions,\u201d App. 3, conveyed that \u201cPowell could consult\nwith a lawyer before answering any particular question,\u201d\nante, at 10 (emphasis added).7 Second, in the Court\u2019s\nview, the addition of a catchall clause at the end of the\nrecitation of rights \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Powell could use his\nright to consult an attorney \u201cwhile the interrogation was\nunderway.\u201d Ibid.\n   The more natural reading of the warning Powell was\ngiven, which (1) contained a temporal limit and (2) failed\nto mention his right to the presence of counsel in the\ninterrogation room, is that Powell only had the right to\nconsult with an attorney before the interrogation began,\nnot that he had the right to have an attorney with him\nduring questioning. Even those few Courts of Appeals\nthat have approved warnings that did not expressly men\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Thisassumption makes it easier for the Court to conclude the warn\ning conveyed a right to have a lawyer present. If a suspect is told he\nhas the right to consult with an attorney before answering any particu\nlar question, the Court may be correct that he would reasonably con\nclude he has the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence because otherwise he\nwould have to imagine he could consult his attorney in some unlikely\nfashion (e.g., by leaving the interrogation room between every ques\ntion).\n10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion the right to an attorney\u2019s presence during interroga\ntion8 have found language of the sort used in Powell\u2019s\nwarning to be misleading. For instance, petitioner cites\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Lamia,\n429 F. 2d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying\nthe properly flexible approach to Miranda. But in that\ncase, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning\nthat a suspect \u201c \u2018could consult an attorney prior to any\nquestion,\u2019 \u201d which was \u201caffirmatively misleading since it\nwas thought to imply that the attorney could not be pre\nsent during questioning.\u201d 429 F. 2d, at 377.9 That even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not\n\nexpressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during\ninterrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his Miranda\nrights. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman, 963 F. 2d 137, 141 (CA6\n1992); United States v. Bland, 908 F. 2d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); United\nStates v. Anthon, 648 F. 2d 669, 672\u2013673 (CA10 1981); Windsor v.\nUnited States, 389 F. 2d 530, 533 (CA5 1968). And most of the Circuits\nthat have not required express mention of the right to an attorney\u2019s\npresence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to\nan attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the\nright to counsel\u2019s presence during interrogation but which also con\ntained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad\nnature of his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Frankson, 83\nF. 3d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); United States v. Caldwell, 954 F. 2d 496, 502\n(CA8 1992); United States v. Adams, 484 F. 2d 357, 361\u2013362 (CA7\n1973). I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his \u201cright to counsel,\u201d\nwithout more, reasonably conveys a suspect\u2019s full rights under\nMiranda, but at least such a general warning does not include the same\nsort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell\u2019s warning.\n  9 Petitioner also cites Bridgers v. Dretke, 431 F. 3d 853 (CA5 2005), in\n\nwhich the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did\nnot unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding\nadequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that \u201che had the\nright to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.\u201d\nId., at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that\nwarning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an\nattorney\u2019s presence during interrogation, the fact that the warning\nmentioned an attorney\u2019s presence materially distinguishes it from the\nwarning Powell received. The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Courts of Appeals taking the most flexible approach to\nMiranda have found warnings like Powell\u2019s misleading\nshould caution the Court against concluding that such a\nwarning reasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an\nattorney with him during the interrogation.\n   When the relevant clause of the warning in this case is\ngiven its most natural reading, the catchall clause does\nnot meaningfully clarify Powell\u2019s rights. It communicated\nthat Powell could exercise the previously listed rights at\nany time. Yet the only previously listed right was the\n\u201cright to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Informing\nPowell that he could exercise, at any time during the\ninterview, the right to talk to a lawyer before answering\nany questions did not reasonably convey the right to talk\nto a lawyer after answering some questions, much less\nimplicitly inform Powell of his right to have a lawyer with\nhim at all times during interrogation. An intelligent\nsuspect could reasonably conclude that all he was provided\nwas a one-time right to consult with an attorney, not a\nright to have an attorney present with him in the interro\ngation room at all times.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate court\u2019s assessment that warning a suspect solely that \u201che had the\nright to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning . . . might\nhave created the [impermissible] impression that the attorney could not\nbe present during interrogation.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   10 The Court supports its analysis by taking note of Powell\u2019s testi\n\nmony at trial, given after the trial judge had overruled his lawyer\u2019s\nobjection that the warning he received was inadequate. In my view, the\ntestimony in context is not probative of what Powell thought the\nwarnings meant. It did not explore what Powell understood the warn\nings to mean, but simply established, as a prelude to Powell\u2019s testimony\nexplaining his prior statement, that he had waived his rights. Regard\nless, the testimony is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges. \u201cNo\namount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware\nof [the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation] will suffice\nto stand\u201d in the stead of an adequate warning. Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n12                      FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court relies on Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195\n(1989), and Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, but in neither case did\nthe warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect\u2019s\nrights. In Prysock, the warning regarding the right to an\nappointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see\nid., at 360\u2013361, which clearly distinguishes that case from\nPowell\u2019s. In Duckworth, the suspect was explicitly in\nformed that he had the right \u201cto talk to a lawyer for advice\nbefore we ask you any questions, and to have him with you\nduring questioning,\u201d and that he had \u201cthis right to the\nadvice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford\nto hire one.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). The warning thus conveyed in\nfull the right to appointed counsel before and during the\ninterrogation. Although the warning was arguably under\ncut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would\nbe appointed \u201cif and when you go to court,\u201d the Court\nfound the suspect was informed of his full rights and the\nwarning simply added additional, truthful information\nregarding when counsel would be appointed. Ibid. (em\nphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike\nthe Duckworth warning, Powell\u2019s warning did not convey\nhis Miranda rights in full with the addition of some ar\nguably misleading statement. Rather, the warning en\ntirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct\nright \u201cto have counsel present during any questioning.\u201d\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 470.\n   In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not rea\nsonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with\nhim during the interrogation. \u201cThe requirement of warn\nings . . . [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth\nAmendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual\nto existing methods of interrogation.\u201d Id., at 476.

See ante, at 12.\nAs the majority\u2019s decision today demonstrates, reasonable\njudges may well differ over the question whether the\ndeficiency is serious enough to violate the Federal Consti\ntution. That difference of opinion, in my judgment, falls\nshort of providing a justification for reviewing this case\nwhen the judges of the highest court of the State have\ndecided the warning is insufficiently protective of the\nrights of the State\u2019s citizens. In my view, respect for the\nindependence of state courts, and their authority to set the\nrules by which their citizens are protected, should result\nin a dismissal of this petition.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

S. 436, 471, this\n  Court held that an individual must be \u201cclearly informed,\u201d prior to\n  custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to\n  consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n  rogation.\u201d\n    After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him,\n  Tampa Police read him their standard Miranda form, stating, inter\n  alia: \u201cYou have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of\n  our questions\u201d and \u201c[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at\n  any time you want during this interview.\u201d Powell then admitted he\n  owned a handgun found in a police search. He was charged with pos\n  session of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.\n  The trial court denied Powell\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory\n  statements, which was based on the contention that the Miranda\n  warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the pres\n  ence of an attorney during questioning. Powell was convicted of the\n  gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that\n  the trial court should have suppressed the statements. The Florida\n  Supreme Court agreed. It noted that both Miranda and the State\n  Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to\n  have a lawyer present during questioning. The advice Powell re\n  ceived was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that\n  he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to\n  question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsel\u2019s presence\n  throughout the interrogation.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case. Powell contends\n that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied\n on the State\u2019s Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision\n2                          FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rested on an adequate and independent state ground. See Coleman\n    v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n    1032, 1040\u20131041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears\n    to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,\n    and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground\n    is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that fed\n    eral law controlled the state court\u2019s decision. Although invoking Flor\n    ida\u2019s Constitution and precedent in addition to this Court\u2019s decisions,\n    the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave\n    Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\n    Miranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044. The state-court opinion con\n    sistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what\n    Florida law independently requires. This Court therefore cannot\n    identify, \u201cfrom the face of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the de\n    cision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See Long,\n    463 U. S., at 1041. Because the opinion does not \u201cindicat[e] clearly\n    and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate,\n    adequate, and independent [state] grounds,\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at 1041,\n    this Court has jurisdiction. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       2. Advice that a suspect has \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\n    answering any of [the law enforcement officers\u2019] questions,\u201d and that\n    he can invoke this right \u201cat any time . . . during th[e] interview,\u201d sat\n    isfies Miranda. Pp. 7\u201313.\n          (a) Miranda requires that a suspect \u201cbe warned prior to any\n    questioning . . . that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d\n    384 U. S., at 479. This Miranda warning addresses the Court\u2019s par\n    ticular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody in\n    terrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one\n    merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interro\n    gators.\u201d Id., at 469. Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as\n    \u201can absolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual held\n    for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to\n    consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n    rogation.\u201d Id., at 471. While the warnings prescribed by Miranda\n    are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the es\n    sential information must be conveyed. See, e.g., California v. Pry\n    sock, 453 U. S. 355, 359. In determining whether police warnings\n    were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to \u201cexamine\n    [them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.\n    The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to\n    [a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth v.\n    Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203. Pp. 7\u20139.\n          (b) The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard. By in\n    forming Powell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before an\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  swering any of [their] questions,\u201d the Tampa officers communicated\n  that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular\n  question. And the statement that Powell had \u201cthe right to use any of\n  [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview\u201d con\n  firmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the inter\n  rogation was underway. In combination, the two warnings reasona\n  bly conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the\n  outset of interrogation, but at all times. To reach the opposite con\n  clusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the\n  interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive\n  and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be\n  obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each\n  query. Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclu\n  sion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language\n  that Powell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the offi\n  cers\u2019] questions\u201d suggested he could consult with an attorney only be\n  fore the interrogation started. In context, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely\n  conveyed that Powell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective before he\n  answered any questions at all. Nothing in the words used indicated\n  that counsel\u2019s presence would be restricted after the questioning\n  commenced. Powell suggests that today\u2019s holding will tempt law en\n  forcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings\n  to introduce ambiguity. But, as the Federal Government explains, it\n  is in law enforcement\u2019s own interest to state warnings with maxi\n  mum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the\n  advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspect\u2019s statement. The\n  standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are\n  admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise\n  formulation necessary to meet Miranda\u2019s requirements. Different\n  words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communi\n  cated the same message.

Arizona, 384\nU.

Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983), the following presumption:\n     \u201c[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to\n     rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with\n     the federal law, and when the adequacy and inde\n     pendence of any possible state law ground is not clear\n     from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the\n     most reasonable explanation that the state court de\n     cided the case the way it did because it believed that\n     federal law required it to do so.\u201d\nAt the same time, we adopted a plain-statement rule to\navoid the presumption: \u201cIf the state court decision indi\ncates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on\nbona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds,\nwe, of course, will not undertake to review the decision.\u201d\nId., at 1041.2\n   Under the Long presumption, we have jurisdiction to\nentertain this case.

Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), JUSTICE\nSTEVENS did not urge, as he now does, inspection of state-court deci\nsions to count the number of citations to state and federal provisions\nand opinions, or heroic efforts to fathom what the state court really\nmeant. See post, at 3\u20137 (dissenting opinion). Instead, his preferred\napproach was as clear as the Court\u2019s. In lieu of \u201cpresuming that\nadequate state grounds are not independent unless it clearly appears\notherwise,\u201d he would have \u201cpresum[ed] that adequate state grounds are\nindependent unless it clearly appears otherwise.\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at\n1066; see post, at 2, n. 1. Either presumption would avoid arduous\nefforts to detect, case by case, whether a state ground of decision is\ntruly \u201cindependent of the [state court\u2019s] understanding of federal law.\u201d\nLong, 463 U. S., at 1066. Today, however, the dissent would require\nthis Court to engage in just that sort of inquiry.\n6                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexpressly asserted that state-law sources gave Powell\nrights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\nMiranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.\n   Beginning with the certified question\u2014whether the\nadvice the Tampa police gave to Powell \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (some capitalization omit\nted)\u2014and continuing throughout its opinion, the Florida\nSupreme Court trained on what Miranda demands, rather\nthan on what Florida law independently requires. See,\ne.g., 998 So. 2d, at 533 (\u201cThe issue before this Court is\nwhether the failure to provide express advice of the right\nto the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation\nviolates the principles espoused in Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436.\u201d); id., at 538 (\u201c[T]he issue of [what] Miranda\nrequires . . . has been addressed by several of the Florida\ndistrict courts of appeal.\u201d); id., at 542 (Powell received a\n\u201cnarrower and less functional warning than that required\nby Miranda.\u201d).3 We therefore cannot identify, \u201cfrom the\nface of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the decision\nrested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See\nLong, 463 U. S., at 1041 (the state court \u201cneed only make\nclear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that\nthe federal cases are being used only for the purpose of\nguidance, and do not themselves compel the result that\nthe court has reached\u201d).4 \u201cTo avoid misunderstanding, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that these statements refer to Miranda\n\nonly in a \u201cgeneric\u201d sense to mean \u201cthe warnings suspects must be given\nbefore interrogation.\u201d Post, at 6. This explanation fails to account for\nthe Florida Supreme Court\u2019s repeated citations to the opinion in\nMiranda. In context, it is obvious that the court was attempting to\nhome in on what that opinion\u2014which, of course, interpreted only the\nFederal Constitution and not Florida law\u2014requires.

Nothing in our decision today, we\nemphasize, trenches on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\nauthority to impose, based on the State\u2019s Constitution, any\nadditional protections against coerced confessions it deems\nappropriate. But because the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision does not \u201cindicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is\nalternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and\nindependent [state] grounds,\u201d Long, 463 U.

[the] state court decision fairly appears to . . .\nbe interwoven with . . . federal law,\u201d the only way to avoid the jurisdic\ntional presumption is to provide a plain statement expressing inde\npendent reliance on state law. 463 U. S., at 1040. It is this plain\nstatement that makes \u201cthe adequacy and independence of any possible\nstate law ground . . . clear from the face of the opinion.\u201d Id., at 1040\u2013\n1041. See also Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 44 (1996) (GINSBURG, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cLong governs even when, all things consid\nered, the more plausible reading of the state court\u2019s decision may be\nthat the state court did not regard the Federal Constitution alone as a\nsufficient basis for its ruling.\u201d).\n8                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolice to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing\ncustodial interrogation.\u201d Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.\n195, 201 (1989). Intent on \u201cgiv[ing] concrete constitutional\nguidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to\nfollow,\u201d 384 U. S., at 441\u2013442, Miranda prescribed the\nfollowing four now-familiar warnings:\n    \u201c[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning\n    [1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that any\n    thing he says can be used against him in a court of\n    law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an at\n    torney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney\n    one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning\n    if he so desires.\u201d Id., at 479.\n   Miranda\u2019s third warning\u2014the only one at issue here\u2014\naddresses our particular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances\nsurrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very\nquickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of\nhis privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.\u201d Id.,\nat 469. Responsive to that concern, we stated, as \u201can\nabsolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual\nheld for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has\nthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer\nwith him during interrogation.\u201d Id., at 471. The question\nbefore us is whether the warnings Powell received satis\nfied this requirement.\n   The four warnings Miranda requires are invariable, but\nthis Court has not dictated the words in which the essen\ntial information must be conveyed. See California v.\nPrysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam) (\u201cThis\nCourt has never indicated that the rigidity of Miranda\nextends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a\ncriminal defendant.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nRhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 297 (1980) (safe\nguards against self-incrimination include \u201cMiranda warn\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

In determining whether\npolice officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we\nhave said, reviewing courts are not required to examine\nthe words employed \u201cas if construing a will or defining the\nterms of an easement. The inquiry is simply whether the\nwarnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as\nrequired by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 203\n(quoting Prysock, 453 U. S., at 361).\n                              B\n    Our decisions in Prysock and Duckworth inform our\njudgment here. Both concerned a suspect\u2019s entitlement to\nadequate notification of the right to appointed counsel. In\nPrysock, an officer informed the suspect of, inter alia, his\nright to a lawyer\u2019s presence during questioning and his\nright to counsel appointed at no cost. 453 U. S., at 356\u2013\n357. The Court of Appeals held the advice inadequate to\ncomply with Miranda because it lacked an express state\nment that the appointment of an attorney would occur\nprior to the impending interrogation. See 453 U. S., at\n358\u2013359. We reversed. Id., at 362. \u201c[N]othing in the\nwarnings,\u201d we observed, \u201csuggested any limitation on the\nright to the presence of appointed counsel different from\nthe clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general, includ\ning the right to a lawyer before [the suspect is] questioned,\n. . . while [he is] being questioned, and all during the\nquestioning.\u201d Id., at 360\u2013361 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n    Similarly, in Duckworth, we upheld advice that, in\nrelevant part, communicated the right to have an attorney\npresent during the interrogation and the right to an ap\npointed attorney, but also informed the suspect that the\nlawyer would be appointed \u201cif and when [the suspect goes]\nto court.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201cThe Court of Appeals thought\nth[e] \u2018if and when you go to court\u2019 language suggested that\n10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nonly those accused who can afford an attorney have the\nright to have one present before answering any ques\ntions. \u201d Id., at 203 (some internal quotation marks omit\nted). We thought otherwise. Under the relevant state\nlaw, we noted, \u201ccounsel is appointed at [a] defendant\u2019s\ninitial appearance in court.\u201d Id., at 204. The \u201cif and when\nyou go to court\u201d advice, we said, \u201csimply anticipate[d]\u201d a\nquestion the suspect might be expected to ask after receiv\ning Miranda warnings, i.e., \u201cwhen [will he] obtain coun\nsel.\u201d 492 U. S., at 204. Reading the \u201cif and when\u201d lan\nguage together with the other information conveyed, we\nheld that the warnings, \u201cin their totality, satisfied\nMiranda.\u201d Id., at 205.\n   We reach the same conclusion in this case. The Tampa\nofficers did not \u201centirely omi[t],\u201d post, at 9, any informa\ntion Miranda required them to impart. They informed\nPowell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\nanswering any of [their] questions\u201d and \u201cthe right to use\nany of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e]\ninterview.\u201d App. 3. The first statement communicated\nthat Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering\nany particular question, and the second statement con\nfirmed that he could exercise that right while the interro\ngation was underway. In combination, the two warnings\nreasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an attorney\npresent, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all\ntimes.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the Court today approves, for \u201cthe\n\nfirst time[,] . . . a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely\nomitted an essential element of a suspect\u2019s rights.\u201d Post, at 9. See also\npost, at 12 (\u201c[T]he warning entirely failed to inform [Powell] of the\nseparate and distinct right \u2018to have counsel present during any ques\ntioning.\u2019 \u201d). We find the warning in this case adequate, however, only\nbecause it communicated just what Miranda prescribed. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS ascribes a different meaning to the warning Powell received,\nbut he cannot credibly suggest that the Court regards the warning to\nhave omitted a vital element of Powell\u2019s rights.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney\nwould not be present throughout the interrogation, the\nsuspect would have to imagine an unlikely scenario: To\nconsult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter\nthe interrogation room between each query. A reasonable\nsuspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his\nrights, we believe, would not come to the counterintuitive\nconclusion that he is obligated, or allowed, to hop in and\nout of the holding area to seek his attorney\u2019s advice.6\nInstead, the suspect would likely assume that he must\nstay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer\nwould be there with him the entire time.7\n   The Florida Supreme Court found the warning mislead\ning because it believed the temporal language\u2014that Pow\nell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d\u2014suggested Powell could consult with\nan attorney only before the interrogation started. 998\nSo. 2d, at 541. See also Brief for Respondent 28\u201329. In\ncontext, however, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely conveyed when\nPowell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective\u2014namely,\nbefore he answered any questions at all. Nothing in the\nwords used indicated that counsel\u2019s presence would be\nrestricted after the questioning commenced. Instead, the\nwarning communicated that the right to counsel carried\nforward to and through the interrogation: Powell could\nseek his attorney\u2019s advice before responding to \u201cany of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d and \u201cat any time . . . during th[e]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 It is equally unlikely that the suspect would anticipate a scenario of\n\nthis order: His lawyer would be admitted into the interrogation room\neach time the police ask him a question, then ushered out each time the\nsuspect responds.\n  7 Although it does not bear on our decision, Powell seems to have\n\nunderstood the warning this way. The following exchange between\nPowell and his attorney occurred when Powell testified at his trial:\n  \u201cQ. You waived the right to have an attorney present during your\nquestioning by detectives; is that what you\u2019re telling this jury?\n  \u201cA. Yes.\u201d App. 80.\n12                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterview.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Although the warn\nings were not the clearest possible formulation of\nMiranda\u2019s right-to-counsel advisement, they were suffi\nciently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a\ncommonsense reading.\n   Pursuing a different line of argument, Powell points out\nthat most jurisdictions in Florida and across the Nation\nexpressly advise suspects of the right to have counsel\npresent both before and during interrogation. Brief for\nRespondent 41\u201344. If we find the advice he received ade\nquate, Powell suggests, law enforcement agencies, hoping\nto obtain uninformed waivers, will be tempted to end-run\nMiranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambi\nguity. Brief for Respondent 50\u201353. But as the United\nStates explained as amicus curiae in support of the State\nof Florida, \u201claw enforcement agencies have little reason to\nassume the litigation risk of experimenting with novel\nMiranda formulations,\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6; instead, it is \u201cdesirable police practice\u201d and \u201cin\nlaw enforcement\u2019s own interest\u201d to state warnings with\nmaximum clarity, id., at 12.

The stan\ndard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investiga\ntion are exemplary. They provide, in relevant part: \u201cYou\nhave the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask\nyou any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer\nwith you during questioning.\u201d Ibid., n. 3 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).

The Court\u2019s power to review that\ndecision is doubtful at best; moreover, the Florida Su\npreme Court has the better view on the merits.\n                             I\n  In this case, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that\n\u201c[b]oth Miranda and article I, section 9 of the Florida\nConstitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of\nthe right to have a lawyer present during questioning,\u201d\nand that the warnings given to Powell did not satisfy\neither the State or the Federal Constitution. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746854\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746854/state-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (2008). In my view, the Florida Supreme Court\nheld on an adequate and independent state-law ground\nthat the warnings provided to Powell did not sufficiently\ninform him of the \u201c \u2018right to a lawyer\u2019s help\u2019 \u201d under the\nFlorida Constitution, id., at 535. This Court therefore\nlacks jurisdiction to review the judgment below, notwith\nstanding the failure of that court to include some express\nsentence that would satisfy this Court\u2019s \u201cplain-statement\nrule,\u201d ante, at 5.\n  The adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine\nrests on two \u201ccornerstones\u201d: \u201c[r]espect for the independ\n2                       FLORIDA v.

S. 1032, 1040 (1983).\nIn Long, the Court adopted a novel presumption in favor\nof jurisdiction when the independence of a state court\u2019s\nstate-law judgment is not clear. But we only respect the\nindependence of state courts and avoid rendering advisory\nopinions if we limit the application of that presumption to\ntruly ambiguous cases.1 This is not such a case.\n  \u201c[I]f the same judgment would be rendered by the state\ncourt after we corrected its views of federal laws, our\nreview could amount to nothing more than an advisory\nopinion.\u201d Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 126 (1945). In\nLong we advised every state court of a formula by which it\ncould assure us that our review would indeed amount to\nnothing more than an advisory opinion. The state court\n\u201cneed only make clear by a plain statement in its judg\nment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only\nfor the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel\nthe result that the court has reached.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1041.\nThat advice has sometimes been misunderstood as a com\nmand that unless such a plain statement is included in a\nstate-court opinion, the court\u2019s ruling cannot have rested\non an adequate and independent state ground. But the\nreal question is whether \u201cthe adequacy and independence\nof any possible state law ground is . . . clear from the face\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In my view, this Court would better respect the independence of\n\nstate courts by applying the opposite presumption, as it did in the years\nprior to 1983. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1066\u20131067 (STEVENS, J., dissent\ning). But accepting Long as the law, we can limit its negative effects\u2014\nunnecessary intrusion into the business of the state courts and unnec\nessary advisory opinions\u2014only if we limit its application to cases in\nwhich the independence of the state-law ground is in serious doubt.\nSee Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 950 (1996) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he unfortunate effects of [its] rule\u201d are \u201cexacerbate[d]\n. . . to a nearly intolerable degree\u201d when the Long presumption is\napplied to cases in which \u201cthe state-law ground supporting th[e] judg\nmen[t] is so much clearer than has been true on most prior occasions\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Even if a state court\nopinion does not include the magic words set forth in\nLong, or some similarly explicit sentence, we lack jurisdic\ntion if it is nonetheless apparent that the decision is in\ndeed supported by an adequate and independent state\nground. Contrary to the assumption made by the Court,\nwe have no power to assume jurisdiction that does not\notherwise exist simply because the Florida Supreme Court\ndid not include in its decision some express statement that\nits interpretation of state law is independent.\n   In my view, we can tell from the face of the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe decision rested on a\nstate ground separate from Miranda,\u201d ante, at 6. This\ncase is easily distinguished from Long in that regard. In\nLong, although the Michigan Supreme Court had twice\ncited the Michigan Constitution in its opinion, it \u201crelied\nexclusively on its understanding of Terry [v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968),] and other federal cases. Not a single state\ncase was cited to support the state court\u2019s holding that the\nsearch of the passenger compartment was unconstitu\ntional.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1043. There was, in short, nothing\nto \u201cindicate that the decision below rested on grounds in\nany way independent from the state court\u2019s interpretation\nof federal law.\u201d Id., at 1044.\n   Other cases in which we have applied the Long pre\nsumption have been similarly devoid of independent state\nlaw analysis. We typically apply the Long presumption\nwhen the state court\u2019s decision cited a state constitutional\nprovision only a few times or not at all, and rested exclu\nsively upon federal cases or upon state cases that them\nselves cited only federal law.2 We have also applied Long\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See, e.g., Illinois v.

The court consistently referred to these state-law\nrights as separate and distinct from Miranda, noting that\nin its earlier cases, it had explained that \u201cthe require\nments of both the Fifth Amendment, as explained in\nMiranda, and the Florida Constitution, as explained in\nTraylor,\u201d include \u201cthe requirement that a suspect be in\nformed of the right to have counsel present during ques\ntioning.\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 537\u2013538.

That we have overreached before is no\nreason to repeat the mistake again.\n   5 In examining what the state-court opinion said regarding state law,\n\nand whether the state precedent cited in the opinion relied upon state\nlaw, I am undertaking no effort more arduous than what the Court has\ntypically undertaken in order to determine whether the Long presump\ntion applies: examining how frequently a state-court opinion cited state\nlaw, whether state law is coextensive with federal law, and whether the\ncited state cases relied upon federal law. See nn. 2\u20133, supra.\n6                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlawyer\u2019s help\u201d under the Florida Constitution. Id., at 540.\n   Moreover, the state cases relied upon by the Florida\nSupreme Court did not themselves rely exclusively on\nfederal law. The primary case relied upon for the state\nlaw holding, Traylor, rested exclusively upon state law.\nSee 596 So. 2d, at 961. In that decision, the Florida Su\npreme Court embraced the principle that \u201c[w]hen called\nupon to decide matters of fundamental rights, Florida\u2019s\nstate courts are bound under federalist principles to give\nprimacy to our state Constitution and to give independent\nlegal import to every phrase and clause contained\ntherein.\u201d Id., at 962. Elaborating upon the meaning of\nArt. I, \u00a79 of the Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme\nCourt explained the roots of Florida\u2019s commitment to\nprotecting its citizens from self-incrimination. Florida has\nlong \u201crequired as a matter of state law that one charged\nwith a crime be informed of his rights prior to rendering a\nconfession.\u201d Id., at 964. It has required warnings before\nsome interrogations since at least 1889, and has for that\nlong excluded confessions obtained in violation of those\nrules. Ibid. In sum, this case looks quite different from\nthose cases in which we have applied the Long presump\ntion in the past.\n   The Court concludes otherwise by relying primarily\nupon the formulation of the certified question and re\nstatements of that question within the Florida Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinion. See ante, at 6. Yet while the certified\nquestion asks whether particular phrases \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda warnings,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (capitalization and\nfootnote omitted), Miranda has become a generic term to\nrefer to the warnings suspects must be given before inter\nrogation, see Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 792\n(11th ed. 2003) (defining \u201cMiranda\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or\nbeing the legal rights of an arrested person to have an\nattorney and to remain silent so as to avoid self\nincrimination\u201d). Thus, its invocation of Miranda in the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncertified question and in its statement of the issue\npresented is entirely consistent with the fact that the\nstate-law basis for its decision is fully adequate and\nindependent.\n   That said, I agree with the Court that the decision below\nis interwoven with federal law. In reaching its state-law\nholding, the Florida Supreme Court found Miranda and\nour other precedents instructive.6 But that alone is insuf\nficient to assure our jurisdiction, even under Long. In my\nview, the judgment\u2014reversal of Powell\u2019s conviction\u2014is\nsupported by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s independent\nand carefully considered holding that these warnings were\ninadequate under the Florida Constitution. See 998\nSo. 2d, at 534\u2013535, 537\u2013538, 540, 542.\n   The Court acknowledges that nothing in today\u2019s decision\n\u201ctrenches on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s authority to\nimpose, based on the State\u2019s Constitution, any additional\nprotections against coerced confessions it deems appropri\nate.\u201d Ante, at 7. As the Florida Supreme Court has noted\non more than one occasion, its interpretation of the Flor\nida Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination need\nnot track our construction of the parallel provision in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Florida Supreme Court need not have decided that state-law\n\nsources \u201cgave Powell rights . . . broader than . . . those delineated in\nMiranda,\u201d ante, at 6, in order for its judgment to have rested upon an\nindependent state-law ground. The independence of a state-law ground\nmay be especially clear when a state court explicitly finds that the state\nconstitution is more protective of a certain right than the national\ncharter, but a state constitutional provision is no less independent for\nproviding the same protection in a given case as does the federal\nprovision, so long as the content of the state-law right is not compelled\nby or dependent upon federal law. Unlike other provisions of Art. I of\nthe Florida Constitution, \u00a79 does not contain an express proviso requir\ning that the right be construed in conformity with the analogous federal\nprovision. Compare Fla. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, with Fla. Const., Art I, \u00a712.\nFurthermore, under Florida law the scope of Art. I, \u00a79 is clearly not\ndependent upon federal law. Rigterink v.

In this\nvery case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its\njudgment upon remand.

Prysock, 453\nU. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam), this is, I believe, the\nfirst time the Court has approved a warning which, if\ngiven its natural reading, entirely omitted an essential\nelement of a suspect\u2019s rights.\n   Despite the failure of the warning to mention it, in the\nCourt\u2019s view the warning \u201creasonably conveyed\u201d to Powell\nthat he had the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence during the\ninterrogation. Ante, at 10. The Court cobbles together\nthis conclusion from two elements of the warning. First,\nthe Court assumes the warning regarding Powell\u2019s right\n\u201cto talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\u2019]\nquestions,\u201d App. 3, conveyed that \u201cPowell could consult\nwith a lawyer before answering any particular question,\u201d\nante, at 10 (emphasis added).7 Second, in the Court\u2019s\nview, the addition of a catchall clause at the end of the\nrecitation of rights \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Powell could use his\nright to consult an attorney \u201cwhile the interrogation was\nunderway.\u201d Ibid.\n   The more natural reading of the warning Powell was\ngiven, which (1) contained a temporal limit and (2) failed\nto mention his right to the presence of counsel in the\ninterrogation room, is that Powell only had the right to\nconsult with an attorney before the interrogation began,\nnot that he had the right to have an attorney with him\nduring questioning. Even those few Courts of Appeals\nthat have approved warnings that did not expressly men\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Thisassumption makes it easier for the Court to conclude the warn\ning conveyed a right to have a lawyer present. If a suspect is told he\nhas the right to consult with an attorney before answering any particu\nlar question, the Court may be correct that he would reasonably con\nclude he has the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence because otherwise he\nwould have to imagine he could consult his attorney in some unlikely\nfashion (e.g., by leaving the interrogation room between every ques\ntion).\n10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion the right to an attorney\u2019s presence during interroga\ntion8 have found language of the sort used in Powell\u2019s\nwarning to be misleading. For instance, petitioner cites\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Lamia,\n429 F. 2d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying\nthe properly flexible approach to Miranda. But in that\ncase, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning\nthat a suspect \u201c \u2018could consult an attorney prior to any\nquestion,\u2019 \u201d which was \u201caffirmatively misleading since it\nwas thought to imply that the attorney could not be pre\nsent during questioning.\u201d 429 F. 2d, at 377.9 That even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not\n\nexpressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during\ninterrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his Miranda\nrights. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman, 963 F. 2d 137, 141 (CA6\n1992); United States v. Bland, 908 F. 2d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); United\nStates v. Anthon, 648 F. 2d 669, 672\u2013673 (CA10 1981); Windsor v.\nUnited States, 389 F. 2d 530, 533 (CA5 1968). And most of the Circuits\nthat have not required express mention of the right to an attorney\u2019s\npresence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to\nan attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the\nright to counsel\u2019s presence during interrogation but which also con\ntained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad\nnature of his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Frankson, 83\nF. 3d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); United States v. Caldwell, 954 F. 2d 496, 502\n(CA8 1992); United States v. Adams, 484 F. 2d 357, 361\u2013362 (CA7\n1973). I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his \u201cright to counsel,\u201d\nwithout more, reasonably conveys a suspect\u2019s full rights under\nMiranda, but at least such a general warning does not include the same\nsort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell\u2019s warning.\n  9 Petitioner also cites Bridgers v. Dretke, 431 F. 3d 853 (CA5 2005), in\n\nwhich the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did\nnot unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding\nadequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that \u201che had the\nright to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.\u201d\nId., at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that\nwarning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an\nattorney\u2019s presence during interrogation, the fact that the warning\nmentioned an attorney\u2019s presence materially distinguishes it from the\nwarning Powell received. The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Courts of Appeals taking the most flexible approach to\nMiranda have found warnings like Powell\u2019s misleading\nshould caution the Court against concluding that such a\nwarning reasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an\nattorney with him during the interrogation.\n   When the relevant clause of the warning in this case is\ngiven its most natural reading, the catchall clause does\nnot meaningfully clarify Powell\u2019s rights. It communicated\nthat Powell could exercise the previously listed rights at\nany time. Yet the only previously listed right was the\n\u201cright to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Informing\nPowell that he could exercise, at any time during the\ninterview, the right to talk to a lawyer before answering\nany questions did not reasonably convey the right to talk\nto a lawyer after answering some questions, much less\nimplicitly inform Powell of his right to have a lawyer with\nhim at all times during interrogation. An intelligent\nsuspect could reasonably conclude that all he was provided\nwas a one-time right to consult with an attorney, not a\nright to have an attorney present with him in the interro\ngation room at all times.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate court\u2019s assessment that warning a suspect solely that \u201che had the\nright to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning . . . might\nhave created the [impermissible] impression that the attorney could not\nbe present during interrogation.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   10 The Court supports its analysis by taking note of Powell\u2019s testi\n\nmony at trial, given after the trial judge had overruled his lawyer\u2019s\nobjection that the warning he received was inadequate. In my view, the\ntestimony in context is not probative of what Powell thought the\nwarnings meant. It did not explore what Powell understood the warn\nings to mean, but simply established, as a prelude to Powell\u2019s testimony\nexplaining his prior statement, that he had waived his rights. Regard\nless, the testimony is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges. \u201cNo\namount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware\nof [the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation] will suffice\nto stand\u201d in the stead of an adequate warning. Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n12                      FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court relies on Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195\n(1989), and Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, but in neither case did\nthe warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect\u2019s\nrights. In Prysock, the warning regarding the right to an\nappointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see\nid., at 360\u2013361, which clearly distinguishes that case from\nPowell\u2019s. In Duckworth, the suspect was explicitly in\nformed that he had the right \u201cto talk to a lawyer for advice\nbefore we ask you any questions, and to have him with you\nduring questioning,\u201d and that he had \u201cthis right to the\nadvice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford\nto hire one.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). The warning thus conveyed in\nfull the right to appointed counsel before and during the\ninterrogation. Although the warning was arguably under\ncut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would\nbe appointed \u201cif and when you go to court,\u201d the Court\nfound the suspect was informed of his full rights and the\nwarning simply added additional, truthful information\nregarding when counsel would be appointed. Ibid. (em\nphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike\nthe Duckworth warning, Powell\u2019s warning did not convey\nhis Miranda rights in full with the addition of some ar\nguably misleading statement. Rather, the warning en\ntirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct\nright \u201cto have counsel present during any questioning.\u201d\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 470.\n   In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not rea\nsonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with\nhim during the interrogation. \u201cThe requirement of warn\nings . . . [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth\nAmendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual\nto existing methods of interrogation.\u201d Id., at 476.

See ante, at 12.\nAs the majority\u2019s decision today demonstrates, reasonable\njudges may well differ over the question whether the\ndeficiency is serious enough to violate the Federal Consti\ntution. That difference of opinion, in my judgment, falls\nshort of providing a justification for reviewing this case\nwhen the judges of the highest court of the State have\ndecided the warning is insufficiently protective of the\nrights of the State\u2019s citizens. In my view, respect for the\nindependence of state courts, and their authority to set the\nrules by which their citizens are protected, should result\nin a dismissal of this petition.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
