ANTHONY CARDELL \n\n                   HAYNES \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09\u2013273.   Decided February 22, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case presents the question whether any decision of\nthis Court \u201cclearly establishes\u201d that a judge, in ruling on\nan objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor\nbased explanation for the challenge unless the judge per\nsonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective\njuror\u2019s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The\nCourt of Appeals appears to have concluded that either\nBatson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008),\nclearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals\nread far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if\nallowed to stand, would have important implications. We\ntherefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon\ndent\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the\nmurder of a police officer, and the State sought the death\npenalty. During voir dire, two judges presided at different\nstages. Judge Harper presided when the attorneys ques\ntioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge\nWallace took over when peremptory challenges were exer\ncised. When the prosecutor struck an African-American\njuror named Owens, respondent\u2019s attorney raised a Batson\n2                   THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nobjection. Judge Wallace determined that respondent had\nmade out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prose\ncutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was\nbased on Owens\u2019 demeanor during individual questioning.\nSpecifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens\u2019 de\nmeanor had been \u201csomewhat humorous\u201d and not \u201cserious\u201d\nand that her \u201cbody language\u201d had belied her \u201ctrue feeling.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 187. Based on his observations of\nOwens during questioning by respondent\u2019s attorney, the\nprosecutor stated, he believed that she \u201chad a predisposi\ntion\u201d and would not look at the possibility of imposing a\ndeath sentence \u201cin a neutral fashion.\u201d Id., at 188. Re\nspondent\u2019s attorney did not dispute the prosecutor\u2019s char\nacterization of Owens\u2019 demeanor, but he asserted that her\nanswers on the jury questionnaire \u201cshow[ed] that she was\na juror who [was] leaning towards the State\u2019s case.\u201d Ibid.\nAfter considering the prosecutor\u2019s explanation and the\narguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s reason for the strike was \u201crace-neutral\u201d\nand denied the Batson objection without further explana\ntion. Id., at 189.\n   The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted\nand sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed the conviction. Rejecting respondent\u2019s\nargument that \u201ca trial judge who did not witness the\nactual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate\na Batson challenge,\u201d id., at 173, the Court of Criminal\nAppeals wrote:\n    \u201cThere are many factors which a trial judge\u2014even one\n    who did not preside over the voir dire examinations\u2014\n    can consider in determining whether the opponent of\n    the peremptory strikes has met his burden. These in\n    clude the nature and strength of the parties\u2019 argu\n    ments during the Batson hearing and the attorneys\u2019\n    demeanor and credibility.

This\nCourt denied respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.\nHaynes v. Texas, 535 U. S. 999 (2002).\n   After the Texas courts denied his application for state\nhabeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition.\nThe District Court denied the petition and observed that\nthis Court had never held that the deference to state-court\nfactual determinations that is mandated by the federal\nhabeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on a\nBatson objection did not observe the jury selection. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 80, n. 10.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of\nappealability with respect to respondent\u2019s Batson objec\ntions concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.\nHaynes v. Quarterman, 526 F. 3d 189, 202 (CA5 2008). In\nits opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed\nour opinion in Snyder at length and then concluded:\n     \u201cUnder Snyder\u2019s application of Batson, . . . an appel\n     late court applying Batson arguably should find clear\n     error when the record reflects that the trial court was\n     not able to verify the aspect of the juror\u2019s demeanor\n     upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremp\n     tory challenge.\u201d 526 F. 3d, at 199.\n  When the same panel later ruled on the merits of re\nspondent\u2019s Batson claim regarding juror Owens,1 the court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violated Batson, the\n\npanel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a\n4                      THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                            Per Curiam\n\nadopted the rule that it had previously termed \u201car\nguabl[e].\u201d See 526 F. 3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman,\n561 F. 3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009). The court concluded that\nthe decisions of the state courts were not owed \u201cAEDPA\ndeference\u201d in this case \u201cbecause the state courts engaged\nin pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns en\ntirely on demeanor.\u201d Ibid. The court then held that\n    \u201cno court, including ours, can now engage in a proper\n    adjudication of the defendant\u2019s demeanor-based Bat\n    son challenge as to prospective juror Owens because\n    we will be relying solely on a paper record and would\n    thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established\n    \u2018factual inquiry\u2019 requirement. See, e.g., Snyder, [552\n    U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].\u201d Ibid. (foot\n    note omitted).\n                              II\n   Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision\nof the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cwas contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d\nA legal principle is \u201cclearly established\u201d within the mean\ning of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding\nof this Court.

S., at 93, in turn\nquoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Devel\nopment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general\nrequirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on\nwhich the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision rests. Batson noted\nthe need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory\nchallenge to \u201ctak[e] into account all possible explanatory\nfactors in the particular case,\u201d 476 U. S., at 95 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,\n545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S.\n162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per\nemptory challenge is based on a prospective juror\u2019s de\nmeanor, the judge should take into account, among other\nthings, any observations of the juror that the judge was\nable to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did\nnot go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana\ntion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot\nrecall the juror\u2019s demeanor.\n   Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 Even   if Snyder did alter or add to Batson\u2019s rule (as the Court of\n6                        THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ncase, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled\non the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to\nconsider how Batson applies when different judges preside\nover these two stages of the jury selection process. Sny\nder, 552 U. S., at 475\u2013478. The part of Snyder on which\nthe Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different\nproblem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had\nexercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of\nwhich was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had\nappeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the\nBatson objection without explanation. 552 U. S., at 478\u2013\n479. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation\nthat was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par\nticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per\nemptory challenge could not be sustained on the de\nmeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the\ntrial judge\u2019s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479\u2013486. Nothing\nin this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the\ndecision below appears to rest.\n   The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana\ntion for a peremptory challenge \u201cinvoke[s] a juror\u2019s de\nmeanor,\u201d the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfirst hand observations\u201d are of\ngreat importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we\ncould not assume that the trial judge had credited the\nclaim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because\nthe peremptory challenge was not exercised until some\ntime after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might\nnot have recalled the juror\u2019s demeanor. Id., at 479. These\nobservations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAppeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted\n\u201cclearly established Federal law as determined by\u201d this Court for\npurposes of respondent\u2019s habeas petition because we decided Snyder\nnearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six\nyears after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at\n412 (opinion for the Court by O\u2019Connor, J.).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsonal recollection of the juror\u2019s demeanor, the judge could\nnot have accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Indeed,\nSnyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best\nevidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is\noften that attorney\u2019s demeanor. See 552 U. S., at 477.\n   Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court\nclearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court\nof Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re\nverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man\ndate the rejection of respondent\u2019s Batson claim regarding\njuror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con\nsider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 de\ntermination may be overcome under the federal habeas\nstatute\u2019s standard for reviewing a state court\u2019s resolution\nof questions of fact.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Decided February 22, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case presents the question whether any decision of\nthis Court \u201cclearly establishes\u201d that a judge, in ruling on\nan objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor\nbased explanation for the challenge unless the judge per\nsonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective\njuror\u2019s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The\nCourt of Appeals appears to have concluded that either\nBatson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008),\nclearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals\nread far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if\nallowed to stand, would have important implications. We\ntherefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon\ndent\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the\nmurder of a police officer, and the State sought the death\npenalty. During voir dire, two judges presided at different\nstages.

Judge Wallace determined that respondent had\nmade out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prose\ncutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was\nbased on Owens\u2019 demeanor during individual questioning.\nSpecifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens\u2019 de\nmeanor had been \u201csomewhat humorous\u201d and not \u201cserious\u201d\nand that her \u201cbody language\u201d had belied her \u201ctrue feeling.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 187.

S., at 93, in turn\nquoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Devel\nopment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general\nrequirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on\nwhich the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision rests. Batson noted\nthe need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory\nchallenge to \u201ctak[e] into account all possible explanatory\nfactors in the particular case,\u201d 476 U. S., at 95 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,\n545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S.\n162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per\nemptory challenge is based on a prospective juror\u2019s de\nmeanor, the judge should take into account, among other\nthings, any observations of the juror that the judge was\nable to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did\nnot go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana\ntion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot\nrecall the juror\u2019s demeanor.\n   Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 Even   if Snyder did alter or add to Batson\u2019s rule (as the Court of\n6                        THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ncase, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled\non the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to\nconsider how Batson applies when different judges preside\nover these two stages of the jury selection process. Sny\nder, 552 U. S., at 475\u2013478. The part of Snyder on which\nthe Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different\nproblem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had\nexercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of\nwhich was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had\nappeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the\nBatson objection without explanation. 552 U. S., at 478\u2013\n479. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation\nthat was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par\nticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per\nemptory challenge could not be sustained on the de\nmeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the\ntrial judge\u2019s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479\u2013486. Nothing\nin this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the\ndecision below appears to rest.\n   The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana\ntion for a peremptory challenge \u201cinvoke[s] a juror\u2019s de\nmeanor,\u201d the trial judge\u2019s \u201cfirst hand observations\u201d are of\ngreat importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we\ncould not assume that the trial judge had credited the\nclaim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because\nthe peremptory challenge was not exercised until some\ntime after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might\nnot have recalled the juror\u2019s demeanor. Id., at 479. These\nobservations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAppeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted\n\u201cclearly established Federal law as determined by\u201d this Court for\npurposes of respondent\u2019s habeas petition because we decided Snyder\nnearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six\nyears after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at\n412 (opinion for the Court by O\u2019Connor, J.).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsonal recollection of the juror\u2019s demeanor, the judge could\nnot have accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Indeed,\nSnyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best\nevidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is\noften that attorney\u2019s demeanor. See 552 U. S., at 477.\n   Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court\nclearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court\nof Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re\nverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man\ndate the rejection of respondent\u2019s Batson claim regarding\njuror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con\nsider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 de\ntermination may be overcome under the federal habeas\nstatute\u2019s standard for reviewing a state court\u2019s resolution\nof questions of fact.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
