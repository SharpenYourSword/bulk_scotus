ANTHONY CARDELL \n\n                   HAYNES \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09–273.   Decided February 22, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case presents the question whether any decision of\nthis Court “clearly establishes” that a judge, in ruling on\nan objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor\nbased explanation for the challenge unless the judge per\nsonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective\njuror’s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The\nCourt of Appeals appears to have concluded that either\nBatson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008),\nclearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals\nread far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if\nallowed to stand, would have important implications. We\ntherefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon\ndent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the\nmurder of a police officer, and the State sought the death\npenalty. During voir dire, two judges presided at different\nstages. Judge Harper presided when the attorneys ques\ntioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge\nWallace took over when peremptory challenges were exer\ncised. When the prosecutor struck an African-American\njuror named Owens, respondent’s attorney raised a Batson\n2                   THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nobjection. Judge Wallace determined that respondent had\nmade out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prose\ncutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was\nbased on Owens’ demeanor during individual questioning.\nSpecifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens’ de\nmeanor had been “somewhat humorous” and not “serious”\nand that her “body language” had belied her “true feeling.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 187. Based on his observations of\nOwens during questioning by respondent’s attorney, the\nprosecutor stated, he believed that she “had a predisposi\ntion” and would not look at the possibility of imposing a\ndeath sentence “in a neutral fashion.” Id., at 188. Re\nspondent’s attorney did not dispute the prosecutor’s char\nacterization of Owens’ demeanor, but he asserted that her\nanswers on the jury questionnaire “show[ed] that she was\na juror who [was] leaning towards the State’s case.” Ibid.\nAfter considering the prosecutor’s explanation and the\narguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that\nthe prosecutor’s reason for the strike was “race-neutral”\nand denied the Batson objection without further explana\ntion. Id., at 189.\n   The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted\nand sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed the conviction. Rejecting respondent’s\nargument that “a trial judge who did not witness the\nactual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate\na Batson challenge,” id., at 173, the Court of Criminal\nAppeals wrote:\n    “There are many factors which a trial judge—even one\n    who did not preside over the voir dire examinations—\n    can consider in determining whether the opponent of\n    the peremptory strikes has met his burden. These in\n    clude the nature and strength of the parties’ argu\n    ments during the Batson hearing and the attorneys’\n    demeanor and credibility.

This\nCourt denied respondent’s petition for a writ of certiorari.\nHaynes v. Texas, 535 U. S. 999 (2002).\n   After the Texas courts denied his application for state\nhabeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition.\nThe District Court denied the petition and observed that\nthis Court had never held that the deference to state-court\nfactual determinations that is mandated by the federal\nhabeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on a\nBatson objection did not observe the jury selection. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 80, n. 10.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of\nappealability with respect to respondent’s Batson objec\ntions concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.\nHaynes v. Quarterman, 526 F. 3d 189, 202 (CA5 2008). In\nits opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed\nour opinion in Snyder at length and then concluded:\n     “Under Snyder’s application of Batson, . . . an appel\n     late court applying Batson arguably should find clear\n     error when the record reflects that the trial court was\n     not able to verify the aspect of the juror’s demeanor\n     upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremp\n     tory challenge.” 526 F. 3d, at 199.\n  When the same panel later ruled on the merits of re\nspondent’s Batson claim regarding juror Owens,1 the court\n——————\n  1 Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violated Batson, the\n\npanel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a\n4                      THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                            Per Curiam\n\nadopted the rule that it had previously termed “ar\nguabl[e].” See 526 F. 3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman,\n561 F. 3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009). The court concluded that\nthe decisions of the state courts were not owed “AEDPA\ndeference” in this case “because the state courts engaged\nin pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns en\ntirely on demeanor.” Ibid. The court then held that\n    “no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper\n    adjudication of the defendant’s demeanor-based Bat\n    son challenge as to prospective juror Owens because\n    we will be relying solely on a paper record and would\n    thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established\n    ‘factual inquiry’ requirement. See, e.g., Snyder, [552\n    U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].” Ibid. (foot\n    note omitted).\n                              II\n   Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision\nof the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “was contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\nA legal principle is “clearly established” within the mean\ning of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding\nof this Court. See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 74\n(2006); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000).\nUnder §2254(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief\n(1) “if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to\nthat reached by this Court on a question of law or if the\nstate court decides a case differently than this Court has\non a set of materially indistinguishable facts”; or (2) “if the\nstate court identifies the correct governing legal principle\nfrom this Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that\n—————— \n\ncertificate of appealability had been issued. Haynes v. Quarterman, \n\n561 F. 3d 535, 541, n. 2 (CA5 2009). \n\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 93, in turn\nquoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Devel\nopment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general\nrequirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on\nwhich the Court of Appeals’ decision rests. Batson noted\nthe need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory\nchallenge to “tak[e] into account all possible explanatory\nfactors in the particular case,” 476 U. S., at 95 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,\n545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S.\n162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per\nemptory challenge is based on a prospective juror’s de\nmeanor, the judge should take into account, among other\nthings, any observations of the juror that the judge was\nable to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did\nnot go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana\ntion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot\nrecall the juror’s demeanor.\n   Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that\n——————\n 2 Even   if Snyder did alter or add to Batson’s rule (as the Court of\n6                        THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ncase, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled\non the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to\nconsider how Batson applies when different judges preside\nover these two stages of the jury selection process. Sny\nder, 552 U. S., at 475–478. The part of Snyder on which\nthe Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different\nproblem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had\nexercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of\nwhich was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had\nappeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the\nBatson objection without explanation. 552 U. S., at 478–\n479. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation\nthat was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par\nticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per\nemptory challenge could not be sustained on the de\nmeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the\ntrial judge’s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479–486. Nothing\nin this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the\ndecision below appears to rest.\n   The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana\ntion for a peremptory challenge “invoke[s] a juror’s de\nmeanor,” the trial judge’s “first hand observations” are of\ngreat importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we\ncould not assume that the trial judge had credited the\nclaim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because\nthe peremptory challenge was not exercised until some\ntime after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might\nnot have recalled the juror’s demeanor. Id., at 479. These\nobservations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per\n——————\nAppeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted\n“clearly established Federal law as determined by” this Court for\npurposes of respondent’s habeas petition because we decided Snyder\nnearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six\nyears after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at\n412 (opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsonal recollection of the juror’s demeanor, the judge could\nnot have accepted the prosecutor’s explanation. Indeed,\nSnyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best\nevidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is\noften that attorney’s demeanor. See 552 U. S., at 477.\n   Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court\nclearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court\nof Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re\nverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man\ndate the rejection of respondent’s Batson claim regarding\njuror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con\nsider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ de\ntermination may be overcome under the federal habeas\nstatute’s standard for reviewing a state court’s resolution\nof questions of fact.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 1737, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/02/22/Thaler_v._Haynes.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 559 U.

We concluded that the record refuted the explanation\nthat was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par\nticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per\nemptory challenge could not be sustained on the de\nmeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the\ntrial judge’s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479–486. Nothing\nin this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the\ndecision below appears to rest.\n   The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana\ntion for a peremptory challenge “invoke[s] a juror’s de\nmeanor,” the trial judge’s “first hand observations” are of\ngreat importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we\ncould not assume that the trial judge had credited the\nclaim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because\nthe peremptory challenge was not exercised until some\ntime after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might\nnot have recalled the juror’s demeanor. Id., at 479. These\nobservations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per\n——————\nAppeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted\n“clearly established Federal law as determined by” this Court for\npurposes of respondent’s habeas petition because we decided Snyder\nnearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six\nyears after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at\n412 (opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsonal recollection of the juror’s demeanor, the judge could\nnot have accepted the prosecutor’s explanation. Indeed,\nSnyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best\nevidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is\noften that attorney’s demeanor. See 552 U. S., at 477.\n   Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court\nclearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court\nof Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re\nverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man\ndate the rejection of respondent’s Batson claim regarding\njuror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con\nsider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ de\ntermination may be overcome under the federal habeas\nstatute’s standard for reviewing a state court’s resolution\nof questions of fact.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1737/", "sha1": "9258f2117c5b3ad34531be188a3b89b24929d41f", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-025", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:11"}
