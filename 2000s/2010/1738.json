OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 08–10914.    Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  In Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this\nCourt held that “the use of excessive physical force against\na prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment\n[even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.” In\nthis case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner’s exces\nsive force claim based entirely on its determination that\nhis injuries were “de minimis.” Because the District\nCourt’s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with\nHudson’s direction to decide excessive force claims based\non the nature of the force rather than the extent of the\ninjury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judg\nment is reversed.\n                             I\n  In March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North\nCarolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of North Carolina\npursuant to 42 U. S. C. §1983. Wilkins’ pro se complaint\nalleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was “maliciously and\nsadistically” assaulted “[w]ithout any provocation” by a\ncorrections officer, respondent Gaddy.1 App. to Pet. for\nCert. C–4. According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently\nangered by Wilkins’ request for a grievance form,\n“snatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto\nthe concrete floor.” Ibid. Gaddy “then proceeded to punch,\nkick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to\n——————\n 1 The   materials in the record do not disclose Gaddy’s full name.\n2                    WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nphysically remove him from [Wilkins].” Ibid. Wilkins\nfurther alleged that, “[a]s a result of the excessive force\nused by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries\nincluding a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood\npressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness”\nand “psychological trauma and mental anguish including\ndepression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.”\nIbid.\n  The District Court, on its own motion and without a\nresponse from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins’ complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court\nstated that, “[i]n order to state an excessive force claim\nunder the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish\nthat he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.” No.\n3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (citing\nTaylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v.\nDorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); foot\nnote omitted). According to the court, Wilkins’ alleged\ninjuries were no more severe than those deemed de mini\nmis in the Circuit’s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed,\nthe court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his inju\nries had required medical attention.\n  In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he\nwas unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment\nmight prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been\nprescribed, and continued to take, medication for his\nheadaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And\nhe attached medical records purporting to corroborate his\ninjuries and course of treatment.\n  Describing reconsideration as “an extraordinary rem\nedy,” the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No.\n3:08–cv–00138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical\nrecords, the court observed, indicated that some of Wil\nkins’ alleged injuries “were pre-existing conditions.” Id.,\nat 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pres\nsure and mental health issues even before the assault.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nThe court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray\nafter the incident “to examine his ‘bruised heel,’ ” but it\n“note[d] that bruising is generally considered a de mini\nmus [sic] injury.” Id., at 4. The court similarly character\nized as de minimis Wilkins’ complaints of back pain and\nheadaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his\ncomplaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Ap\npeals affirmed “for the reasons stated by the district\ncourt.” No. 08–7881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).\n                             II\n   In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant\ninjury in order to state an excessive force claim, the\nFourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this\nCourt in Hudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson\nfiled suit under §1983 alleging that corrections officers\nhad used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had\npunched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach\nwithout justification, resulting in “minor bruises and\nswelling of his face, mouth, and lip” as well as loosened\nteeth and a cracked partial dental plate. 503 U. S., at 4.\nA Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson’s favor,\nbut the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,\nholding that an inmate must prove “a significant injury” in\norder to state an excessive force claim. Hudson v. McMil\nlian, 929 F. 2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam). According\nto the Court of Appeals, Hudson’s injuries, which had not\nrequired medical attention, were too “minor” to warrant\nrelief. Ibid.\n   Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the\nnotion that “significant injury” is a threshold requirement\nfor stating an excessive force claim. The “core judicial\ninquiry,” we held, was not whether a certain quantum of\ninjury was sustained, but rather “whether force was ap\nplied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore disci\n4                    WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” 503\nU. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319–\n321 (1986). “When prison officials maliciously and sadisti\ncally use force to cause harm,” the Court recognized, “con\ntemporary standards of decency always are violated . . .\nwhether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise,\nthe Eighth Amendment would permit any physical pun\nishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting\nless than some arbitrary quantity of injury.” Hudson, 503\nU. S., at 9; see also id., at 13–14 (Blackmun, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“The Court today appropriately puts to rest\na seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an exces\nsive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amend\nment only when coupled with ‘significant injury,’ e.g.,\ninjury that requires medical attention or leaves perma\nnent marks”).\n   This is not to say that the “absence of serious injury” is\nirrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7.\n“[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor\nthat may suggest ‘whether the use of force could plausibly\nhave been thought necessary’ in a particular situation.”\nIbid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The extent of\ninjury may also provide some indication of the amount of\nforce applied. As we stated in Hudson, not “every malevo\nlent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.” 503 U. S., at 9. “The Eighth Amendment’s prohi\nbition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily\nexcludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses\nof physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a\nsort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Ibid. (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who com\nplains of a “push or shove” that causes no discernible\ninjury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force\nclaim. Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028,\n1033 (CA2 1973)).\n   Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly corre\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An in\nmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose\nhis ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely be\ncause he has the good fortune to escape without serious\ninjury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that\nthe supposedly “minor” nature of the injuries “provide[d]\nno basis for dismissal of [Hudson’s] §1983 claim” because\n“the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,\nswelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are\nnot de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.” 503\nU. S., at 10.\n   The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite\nsimilar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court’s\nanalysis closely resembles the approach Hudson dis\navowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked,\nkneed, choked, and body slammed “maliciously and sadis\ntically” and “[w]ithout any provocation.” Dismissing Wil\nkins’ action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that\nthis purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a\nbruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medi\ncal treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the\ncourt concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim\nbecause “he simply has not alleged that he suffered any\nthing more than de minimus [sic] injury.” No. 3:08–cv–\n00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.\n   In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis\nnature of Wilkins’ injuries, the District Court relied on two\nFourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166–1168;\nTaylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483–485. Those cases, in turn, were\nbased upon the Fourth Circuit’s earlier decision in Nor\nman v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which\napproved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.\nAccording to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson “does not fore\nclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that,\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff\ncannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force\n6                         WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nclaim if his injuries are de minimis.” 25 F. 3d, at 1263.\n  The Fourth Circuit’s strained reading of Hudson is not\ndefensible. This Court’s decision did not, as the Fourth\nCircuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury\nthreshold for excessive force claims from “significant” to\n“non-de minimis”—whatever those ill-defined terms might\nmean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the “core judicial\ninquiry” from the extent of the injury to the nature of the\nforce—specifically, whether it was nontrivial and “was\napplied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”\n503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did\nhere, that the absence of “some arbitrary quantity of\ninjury” requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force\nclaim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2\n——————\n    2 MostCircuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir\ncuit’s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554\nF. 3d 255, 269–270 (CA2 2009) (“[O]ur Court has reversed summary\ndismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where\nthe plaintiff’s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any\nsignificant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of\nsuch injury if the defendant’s use of force was malicious or sadistic”);\nSmith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648–649 (CA3 2002) (“[T]he Eighth\nAmendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the\ncircumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .\n[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force”);\nOliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view “that\nto support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must\nhave suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical\ninjury” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,\n439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).\n   The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement\nwith the Fourth Circuit’s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163\nF. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (“[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive\nforce claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a\nmore than de minimis injury”). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d\n384, 386 (2006) (“This Court has never directly held that injuries must\nreach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force\nclaim”). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

In order to prevail,\nWilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the\nassault actually occurred but also that it was carried out\n“maliciously and sadistically” rather than as part of “a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.” Ibid.\nMoreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest\nnature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the dam\nages he may recover.\n                        *     *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nsurvived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court’s\nprecedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de\nminimis. See, e.g., ibid. (permitting a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment\nexcessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that\nthe prisoner suffered “one-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee\nand left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left\nthumb,” as well as “back problems”); Gomez, 163 F. 3d, at 922 (refusing\nto grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the\nprisoner alleged “physical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts,\nscrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body”).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08–10914.   Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con\ncurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit’s Eighth\nAmendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v.\nMcMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). But I continue to believe\nthat Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in\njudgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   “At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the\nword ‘punishment’ referred to the penalty imposed for the\ncommission of a crime.” Helling, supra, at 38 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding\nuntil 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\nalso extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a\ncriminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18–20\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan\nsion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter\npretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to\nevery deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should\napply “only [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving\n‘serious’ injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a\nculpable state of mind.” Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).\n2                   WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Hudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious\ninjury. Building upon Estelle’s mislaid foundation, the\nCourt concluded that force, rather than injury, is the\nrelevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive\nforce at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing\nmore than de minimis injury can state a claim under the\nEighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth\nAmendment into “a National Code of Prison Regulation,”\n503 U. S., at 28 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511\nU. S., at 859 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), with\n“federal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison condi\ntions nationwide,” id., at 860. Although neither the Con\nstitution nor our precedents require this result, no party\nto this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I\nconcur in the Court’s judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 1738, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/02/22/Wilkins_v._Gaddy.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                      Cite as: 559 U.

S. 312, 319–\n321 (1986). “When prison officials maliciously and sadisti\ncally use force to cause harm,” the Court recognized, “con\ntemporary standards of decency always are violated . . .\nwhether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise,\nthe Eighth Amendment would permit any physical pun\nishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting\nless than some arbitrary quantity of injury.” Hudson, 503\nU. S., at 9; see also id., at 13–14 (Blackmun, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“The Court today appropriately puts to rest\na seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an exces\nsive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amend\nment only when coupled with ‘significant injury,’ e.g.,\ninjury that requires medical attention or leaves perma\nnent marks”).\n   This is not to say that the “absence of serious injury” is\nirrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7.\n“[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor\nthat may suggest ‘whether the use of force could plausibly\nhave been thought necessary’ in a particular situation.”\nIbid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The extent of\ninjury may also provide some indication of the amount of\nforce applied. As we stated in Hudson, not “every malevo\nlent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.” 503 U. S., at 9. “The Eighth Amendment’s prohi\nbition of ‘cruel and unusual’ punishments necessarily\nexcludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses\nof physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a\nsort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Ibid. (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who com\nplains of a “push or shove” that causes no discernible\ninjury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force\nclaim. Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028,\n1033 (CA2 1973)).\n   Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly corre\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

An in\nmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose\nhis ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely be\ncause he has the good fortune to escape without serious\ninjury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that\nthe supposedly “minor” nature of the injuries “provide[d]\nno basis for dismissal of [Hudson’s] §1983 claim” because\n“the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,\nswelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are\nnot de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.” 503\nU. S., at 10.\n   The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite\nsimilar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court’s\nanalysis closely resembles the approach Hudson dis\navowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked,\nkneed, choked, and body slammed “maliciously and sadis\ntically” and “[w]ithout any provocation.” Dismissing Wil\nkins’ action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that\nthis purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a\nbruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medi\ncal treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the\ncourt concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim\nbecause “he simply has not alleged that he suffered any\nthing more than de minimus [sic] injury.” No. 3:08–cv–\n00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.\n   In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis\nnature of Wilkins’ injuries, the District Court relied on two\nFourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166–1168;\nTaylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483–485. Those cases, in turn, were\nbased upon the Fourth Circuit’s earlier decision in Nor\nman v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which\napproved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.\nAccording to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson “does not fore\nclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that,\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff\ncannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force\n6                         WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nclaim if his injuries are de minimis.” 25 F. 3d, at 1263.\n  The Fourth Circuit’s strained reading of Hudson is not\ndefensible. This Court’s decision did not, as the Fourth\nCircuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury\nthreshold for excessive force claims from “significant” to\n“non-de minimis”—whatever those ill-defined terms might\nmean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the “core judicial\ninquiry” from the extent of the injury to the nature of the\nforce—specifically, whether it was nontrivial and “was\napplied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”\n503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did\nhere, that the absence of “some arbitrary quantity of\ninjury” requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force\nclaim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2\n——————\n    2 MostCircuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir\ncuit’s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554\nF. 3d 255, 269–270 (CA2 2009) (“[O]ur Court has reversed summary\ndismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where\nthe plaintiff’s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any\nsignificant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of\nsuch injury if the defendant’s use of force was malicious or sadistic”);\nSmith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648–649 (CA3 2002) (“[T]he Eighth\nAmendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the\ncircumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .\n[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force”);\nOliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view “that\nto support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must\nhave suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical\ninjury” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,\n439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).\n   The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement\nwith the Fourth Circuit’s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163\nF. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (“[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive\nforce claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a\nmore than de minimis injury”). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d\n384, 386 (2006) (“This Court has never directly held that injuries must\nreach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force\nclaim”). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

In order to prevail,\nWilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the\nassault actually occurred but also that it was carried out\n“maliciously and sadistically” rather than as part of “a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.” Ibid.\nMoreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest\nnature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the dam\nages he may recover.\n                        *     *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted.

OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08–10914.   Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con\ncurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit’s Eighth\nAmendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v.\nMcMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). But I continue to believe\nthat Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in\njudgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   “At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the\nword ‘punishment’ referred to the penalty imposed for the\ncommission of a crime.” Helling, supra, at 38 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding\nuntil 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\nalso extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a\ncriminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18–20\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan\nsion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter\npretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to\nevery deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should\napply “only [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving\n‘serious’ injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a\nculpable state of mind.” Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).\n2                   WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Hudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious\ninjury. Building upon Estelle’s mislaid foundation, the\nCourt concluded that force, rather than injury, is the\nrelevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive\nforce at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing\nmore than de minimis injury can state a claim under the\nEighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth\nAmendment into “a National Code of Prison Regulation,”\n503 U. S., at 28 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511\nU. S., at 859 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), with\n“federal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison condi\ntions nationwide,” id., at 860. Although neither the Con\nstitution nor our precedents require this result, no party\nto this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I\nconcur in the Court’s judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1738/", "sha1": "af2295e3bddf6d4f6cda4b6a8a5496de1bd93db3", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-026", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:11"}
