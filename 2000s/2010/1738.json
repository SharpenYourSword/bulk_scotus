WILKINS v. OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 08\u201310914.    Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  In Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 4 (1992), this\nCourt held that \u201cthe use of excessive physical force against\na prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment\n[even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\u201d In\nthis case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner\u2019s exces\nsive force claim based entirely on its determination that\nhis injuries were \u201cde minimis.\u201d Because the District\nCourt\u2019s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with\nHudson\u2019s direction to decide excessive force claims based\non the nature of the force rather than the extent of the\ninjury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judg\nment is reversed.\n                             I\n  In March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North\nCarolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of North Carolina\npursuant to 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Wilkins\u2019 pro se complaint\nalleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was \u201cmaliciously and\nsadistically\u201d assaulted \u201c[w]ithout any provocation\u201d by a\ncorrections officer, respondent Gaddy.1 App. to Pet. for\nCert. C\u20134. According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently\nangered by Wilkins\u2019 request for a grievance form,\n\u201csnatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto\nthe concrete floor.\u201d Ibid. Gaddy \u201cthen proceeded to punch,\nkick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The   materials in the record do not disclose Gaddy\u2019s full name.\n2                    WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nphysically remove him from [Wilkins].\u201d Ibid. Wilkins\nfurther alleged that, \u201c[a]s a result of the excessive force\nused by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries\nincluding a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood\npressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness\u201d\nand \u201cpsychological trauma and mental anguish including\ndepression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.\u201d\nIbid.\n  The District Court, on its own motion and without a\nresponse from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins\u2019 complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court\nstated that, \u201c[i]n order to state an excessive force claim\nunder the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish\nthat he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No.\n3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (citing\nTaylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v.\nDorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); foot\nnote omitted). According to the court, Wilkins\u2019 alleged\ninjuries were no more severe than those deemed de mini\nmis in the Circuit\u2019s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed,\nthe court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his inju\nries had required medical attention.\n  In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he\nwas unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment\nmight prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been\nprescribed, and continued to take, medication for his\nheadaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And\nhe attached medical records purporting to corroborate his\ninjuries and course of treatment.\n  Describing reconsideration as \u201can extraordinary rem\nedy,\u201d the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No.\n3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical\nrecords, the court observed, indicated that some of Wil\nkins\u2019 alleged injuries \u201cwere pre-existing conditions.\u201d Id.,\nat 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pres\nsure and mental health issues even before the assault.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nThe court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray\nafter the incident \u201cto examine his \u2018bruised heel,\u2019 \u201d but it\n\u201cnote[d] that bruising is generally considered a de mini\nmus [sic] injury.\u201d Id., at 4. The court similarly character\nized as de minimis Wilkins\u2019 complaints of back pain and\nheadaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his\ncomplaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Ap\npeals affirmed \u201cfor the reasons stated by the district\ncourt.\u201d No. 08\u20137881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).\n                             II\n   In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant\ninjury in order to state an excessive force claim, the\nFourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this\nCourt in Hudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson\nfiled suit under \u00a71983 alleging that corrections officers\nhad used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had\npunched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach\nwithout justification, resulting in \u201cminor bruises and\nswelling of his face, mouth, and lip\u201d as well as loosened\nteeth and a cracked partial dental plate. 503 U. S., at 4.\nA Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson\u2019s favor,\nbut the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,\nholding that an inmate must prove \u201ca significant injury\u201d in\norder to state an excessive force claim. Hudson v. McMil\nlian, 929 F. 2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam). According\nto the Court of Appeals, Hudson\u2019s injuries, which had not\nrequired medical attention, were too \u201cminor\u201d to warrant\nrelief. Ibid.\n   Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the\nnotion that \u201csignificant injury\u201d is a threshold requirement\nfor stating an excessive force claim. The \u201ccore judicial\ninquiry,\u201d we held, was not whether a certain quantum of\ninjury was sustained, but rather \u201cwhether force was ap\nplied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore disci\n4                    WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503\nU. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319\u2013\n321 (1986). \u201cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadisti\ncally use force to cause harm,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201ccon\ntemporary standards of decency always are violated . . .\nwhether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise,\nthe Eighth Amendment would permit any physical pun\nishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting\nless than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\u201d Hudson, 503\nU. S., at 9; see also id., at 13\u201314 (Blackmun, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cThe Court today appropriately puts to rest\na seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an exces\nsive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amend\nment only when coupled with \u2018significant injury,\u2019 e.g.,\ninjury that requires medical attention or leaves perma\nnent marks\u201d).\n   This is not to say that the \u201cabsence of serious injury\u201d is\nirrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7.\n\u201c[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor\nthat may suggest \u2018whether the use of force could plausibly\nhave been thought necessary\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201d\nIbid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The extent of\ninjury may also provide some indication of the amount of\nforce applied. As we stated in Hudson, not \u201cevery malevo\nlent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.\u201d 503 U. S., at 9. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohi\nbition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily\nexcludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses\nof physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a\nsort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d Ibid. (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who com\nplains of a \u201cpush or shove\u201d that causes no discernible\ninjury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force\nclaim. Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028,\n1033 (CA2 1973)).\n   Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly corre\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An in\nmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose\nhis ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely be\ncause he has the good fortune to escape without serious\ninjury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that\nthe supposedly \u201cminor\u201d nature of the injuries \u201cprovide[d]\nno basis for dismissal of [Hudson\u2019s] \u00a71983 claim\u201d because\n\u201cthe blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,\nswelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are\nnot de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.\u201d 503\nU. S., at 10.\n   The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite\nsimilar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court\u2019s\nanalysis closely resembles the approach Hudson dis\navowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked,\nkneed, choked, and body slammed \u201cmaliciously and sadis\ntically\u201d and \u201c[w]ithout any provocation.\u201d Dismissing Wil\nkins\u2019 action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that\nthis purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a\nbruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medi\ncal treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the\ncourt concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim\nbecause \u201che simply has not alleged that he suffered any\nthing more than de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No. 3:08\u2013cv\u2013\n00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.\n   In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis\nnature of Wilkins\u2019 injuries, the District Court relied on two\nFourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166\u20131168;\nTaylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483\u2013485. Those cases, in turn, were\nbased upon the Fourth Circuit\u2019s earlier decision in Nor\nman v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which\napproved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.\nAccording to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson \u201cdoes not fore\nclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that,\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff\ncannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force\n6                         WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nclaim if his injuries are de minimis.\u201d 25 F. 3d, at 1263.\n  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s strained reading of Hudson is not\ndefensible. This Court\u2019s decision did not, as the Fourth\nCircuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury\nthreshold for excessive force claims from \u201csignificant\u201d to\n\u201cnon-de minimis\u201d\u2014whatever those ill-defined terms might\nmean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the \u201ccore judicial\ninquiry\u201d from the extent of the injury to the nature of the\nforce\u2014specifically, whether it was nontrivial and \u201cwas\napplied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d\n503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did\nhere, that the absence of \u201csome arbitrary quantity of\ninjury\u201d requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force\nclaim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 MostCircuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir\ncuit\u2019s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554\nF. 3d 255, 269\u2013270 (CA2 2009) (\u201c[O]ur Court has reversed summary\ndismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where\nthe plaintiff\u2019s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any\nsignificant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of\nsuch injury if the defendant\u2019s use of force was malicious or sadistic\u201d);\nSmith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648\u2013649 (CA3 2002) (\u201c[T]he Eighth\nAmendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the\ncircumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .\n[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force\u201d);\nOliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view \u201cthat\nto support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must\nhave suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical\ninjury\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,\n439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).\n   The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement\nwith the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163\nF. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (\u201c[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive\nforce claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a\nmore than de minimis injury\u201d). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d\n384, 386 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has never directly held that injuries must\nreach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force\nclaim\u201d). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n  In holding that the District Court erred in dismissing\nWilkins\u2019 complaint based on the supposedly de minimis\nnature of his injuries, we express no view on the underly\ning merits of his excessive force claim. In order to prevail,\nWilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the\nassault actually occurred but also that it was carried out\n\u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d rather than as part of \u201ca\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\u201d Ibid.\nMoreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest\nnature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the dam\nages he may recover.\n                        *     *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsurvived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court\u2019s\nprecedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de\nminimis. See, e.g., ibid. (permitting a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment\nexcessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that\nthe prisoner suffered \u201cone-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee\nand left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left\nthumb,\u201d as well as \u201cback problems\u201d); Gomez, 163 F. 3d, at 922 (refusing\nto grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the\nprisoner alleged \u201cphysical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts,\nscrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u201310914.   Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con\ncurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s Eighth\nAmendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v.\nMcMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). But I continue to believe\nthat Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in\njudgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   \u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the\nword \u2018punishment\u2019 referred to the penalty imposed for the\ncommission of a crime.\u201d Helling, supra, at 38 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding\nuntil 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\nalso extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a\ncriminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18\u201320\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan\nsion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter\npretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to\nevery deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should\napply \u201conly [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving\n\u2018serious\u2019 injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a\nculpable state of mind.\u201d Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).\n2                   WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Hudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious\ninjury. Building upon Estelle\u2019s mislaid foundation, the\nCourt concluded that force, rather than injury, is the\nrelevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive\nforce at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing\nmore than de minimis injury can state a claim under the\nEighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth\nAmendment into \u201ca National Code of Prison Regulation,\u201d\n503 U. S., at 28 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511\nU. S., at 859 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), with\n\u201cfederal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison condi\ntions nationwide,\u201d id., at 860. Although neither the Con\nstitution nor our precedents require this result, no party\nto this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I\nconcur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n",

Wilkins\nfurther alleged that, \u201c[a]s a result of the excessive force\nused by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries\nincluding a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood\npressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness\u201d\nand \u201cpsychological trauma and mental anguish including\ndepression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.\u201d\nIbid.\n  The District Court, on its own motion and without a\nresponse from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins\u2019 complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. Citing Circuit precedent, the court\nstated that, \u201c[i]n order to state an excessive force claim\nunder the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish\nthat he received more than a de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No.\n3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp. 1, 2 (citing\nTaylor v. McDuffie, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); Riley v.\nDorton, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); foot\nnote omitted). According to the court, Wilkins\u2019 alleged\ninjuries were no more severe than those deemed de mini\nmis in the Circuit\u2019s Taylor and Riley decisions. Indeed,\nthe court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his inju\nries had required medical attention.\n  In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he\nwas unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment\nmight prejudice his claim. He asserted that he had been\nprescribed, and continued to take, medication for his\nheadaches and back pain, as well as for depression. And\nhe attached medical records purporting to corroborate his\ninjuries and course of treatment.\n  Describing reconsideration as \u201can extraordinary rem\nedy,\u201d the court declined to revisit its previous ruling. No.\n3:08\u2013cv\u201300138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p. 1. The medical\nrecords, the court observed, indicated that some of Wil\nkins\u2019 alleged injuries \u201cwere pre-existing conditions.\u201d Id.,\nat 3. Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pres\nsure and mental health issues even before the assault.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nThe court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray\nafter the incident \u201cto examine his \u2018bruised heel,\u2019 \u201d but it\n\u201cnote[d] that bruising is generally considered a de mini\nmus [sic] injury.\u201d Id., at 4. The court similarly character\nized as de minimis Wilkins\u2019 complaints of back pain and\nheadaches. The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his\ncomplaint. In a summary disposition, the Court of Ap\npeals affirmed \u201cfor the reasons stated by the district\ncourt.\u201d No. 08\u20137881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).\n                             II\n   In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant\ninjury in order to state an excessive force claim, the\nFourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this\nCourt in Hudson. Like Wilkins, the prisoner in Hudson\nfiled suit under \u00a71983 alleging that corrections officers\nhad used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. Evidence indicated that the officers had\npunched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach\nwithout justification, resulting in \u201cminor bruises and\nswelling of his face, mouth, and lip\u201d as well as loosened\nteeth and a cracked partial dental plate. 503 U. S., at 4.\nA Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson\u2019s favor,\nbut the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed,\nholding that an inmate must prove \u201ca significant injury\u201d in\norder to state an excessive force claim. Hudson v. McMil\nlian, 929 F. 2d 1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam). According\nto the Court of Appeals, Hudson\u2019s injuries, which had not\nrequired medical attention, were too \u201cminor\u201d to warrant\nrelief. Ibid.\n   Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the\nnotion that \u201csignificant injury\u201d is a threshold requirement\nfor stating an excessive force claim. The \u201ccore judicial\ninquiry,\u201d we held, was not whether a certain quantum of\ninjury was sustained, but rather \u201cwhether force was ap\nplied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore disci\n4                    WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d 503\nU. S., at 7; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319\u2013\n321 (1986). \u201cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadisti\ncally use force to cause harm,\u201d the Court recognized, \u201ccon\ntemporary standards of decency always are violated . . .\nwhether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise,\nthe Eighth Amendment would permit any physical pun\nishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting\nless than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\u201d Hudson, 503\nU. S., at 9; see also id., at 13\u201314 (Blackmun, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cThe Court today appropriately puts to rest\na seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an exces\nsive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amend\nment only when coupled with \u2018significant injury,\u2019 e.g.,\ninjury that requires medical attention or leaves perma\nnent marks\u201d).\n   This is not to say that the \u201cabsence of serious injury\u201d is\nirrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Id., at 7.\n\u201c[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor\nthat may suggest \u2018whether the use of force could plausibly\nhave been thought necessary\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201d\nIbid. (quoting Whitley, 475 U. S., at 321). The extent of\ninjury may also provide some indication of the amount of\nforce applied. As we stated in Hudson, not \u201cevery malevo\nlent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of\naction.\u201d 503 U. S., at 9. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohi\nbition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily\nexcludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses\nof physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a\nsort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d Ibid. (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). An inmate who com\nplains of a \u201cpush or shove\u201d that causes no discernible\ninjury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force\nclaim. Ibid. (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028,\n1033 (CA2 1973)).\n   Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly corre\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts. An in\nmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose\nhis ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely be\ncause he has the good fortune to escape without serious\ninjury. Accordingly, the Court concluded in Hudson that\nthe supposedly \u201cminor\u201d nature of the injuries \u201cprovide[d]\nno basis for dismissal of [Hudson\u2019s] \u00a71983 claim\u201d because\n\u201cthe blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,\nswelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are\nnot de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes.\u201d 503\nU. S., at 10.\n   The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite\nsimilar to the facts in Hudson, and the District Court\u2019s\nanalysis closely resembles the approach Hudson dis\navowed. Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked,\nkneed, choked, and body slammed \u201cmaliciously and sadis\ntically\u201d and \u201c[w]ithout any provocation.\u201d Dismissing Wil\nkins\u2019 action sua sponte, the District Court did not hold that\nthis purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a\nbruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medi\ncal treatment, involved de minimis force. Instead, the\ncourt concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim\nbecause \u201che simply has not alleged that he suffered any\nthing more than de minimus [sic] injury.\u201d No. 3:08\u2013cv\u2013\n00138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at 2.\n   In giving decisive weight to the purportedly de minimis\nnature of Wilkins\u2019 injuries, the District Court relied on two\nFourth Circuit cases. See Riley, 115 F. 3d, at 1166\u20131168;\nTaylor, 155 F. 3d, at 483\u2013485. Those cases, in turn, were\nbased upon the Fourth Circuit\u2019s earlier decision in Nor\nman v. Taylor, 25 F. 3d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which\napproved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.\nAccording to the Fourth Circuit, Hudson \u201cdoes not fore\nclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view . . . that,\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff\ncannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force\n6                         WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nclaim if his injuries are de minimis.\u201d 25 F. 3d, at 1263.\n  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s strained reading of Hudson is not\ndefensible. This Court\u2019s decision did not, as the Fourth\nCircuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury\nthreshold for excessive force claims from \u201csignificant\u201d to\n\u201cnon-de minimis\u201d\u2014whatever those ill-defined terms might\nmean. Instead, the Court aimed to shift the \u201ccore judicial\ninquiry\u201d from the extent of the injury to the nature of the\nforce\u2014specifically, whether it was nontrivial and \u201cwas\napplied . . . maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d\n503 U. S., at 7. To conclude, as the District Court did\nhere, that the absence of \u201csome arbitrary quantity of\ninjury\u201d requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force\nclaim improperly bypasses this core inquiry. Id., at 9.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 MostCircuits to consider the issue have rejected the Fourth Cir\ncuit\u2019s de minimis injury requirement. See, e.g., Wright v. Goord, 554\nF. 3d 255, 269\u2013270 (CA2 2009) (\u201c[O]ur Court has reversed summary\ndismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where\nthe plaintiff\u2019s evidence of injury was slight . . . . [T]he absence of any\nsignificant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of\nsuch injury if the defendant\u2019s use of force was malicious or sadistic\u201d);\nSmith v. Mensinger, 293 F. 3d 641, 648\u2013649 (CA3 2002) (\u201c[T]he Eighth\nAmendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the\ncircumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. . . .\n[D]e minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force\u201d);\nOliver v. Keller, 289 F. 3d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view \u201cthat\nto support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must\nhave suffered from the excessive force a more than de minimis physical\ninjury\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. LaVallee,\n439 F. 3d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).\n   The Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement\nwith the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Chandler, 163\nF. 3d 921, 924 (1999) (\u201c[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive\nforce claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a\nmore than de minimis injury\u201d). But see Brown v. Lippard, 472 F. 3d\n384, 386 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has never directly held that injuries must\nreach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force\nclaim\u201d). Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

In order to prevail,\nWilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the\nassault actually occurred but also that it was carried out\n\u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d rather than as part of \u201ca\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\u201d Ibid.\nMoreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest\nnature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the dam\nages he may recover.\n                        *     *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsurvived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court\u2019s\nprecedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-de\nminimis. See, e.g., ibid. (permitting a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment\nexcessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that\nthe prisoner suffered \u201cone-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee\nand left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left\nthumb,\u201d as well as \u201cback problems\u201d); Gomez, 163 F. 3d, at 922 (refusing\nto grant summary judgment on de minimis injury grounds where the\nprisoner alleged \u201cphysical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts,\nscrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

OFFICER GADDY\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u201310914.   Decided February 22, 2010\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con\ncurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s Eighth\nAmendment analysis is inconsistent with Hudson v.\nMcMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). But I continue to believe\nthat Hudson was wrongly decided. Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U. S. 89, 95 (2007) (dissenting opinion); Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U. S. 825, 858 (1994) (opinion concurring in\njudgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 37 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion); Hudson, supra, at 17 (dissenting\nopinion).\n   \u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, the\nword \u2018punishment\u2019 referred to the penalty imposed for the\ncommission of a crime.\u201d Helling, supra, at 38 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court adhered to this understanding\nuntil 1976, when it declared in Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97, that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause\nalso extends to prison conditions not imposed as part of a\ncriminal sentence. See generally Hudson, supra, at 18\u201320\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, supra, at 861 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment). To limit this abrupt expan\nsion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new inter\npretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to\nevery deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should\napply \u201conly [to] that narrow class of deprivations involving\n\u2018serious\u2019 injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a\nculpable state of mind.\u201d Hudson, supra, at 20 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (citing Estelle, supra, at 106); see generally\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).\n2                   WILKINS v. GADDY\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Hudson, however, discarded the requirement of serious\ninjury. Building upon Estelle\u2019s mislaid foundation, the\nCourt concluded that force, rather than injury, is the\nrelevant inquiry, and that a prisoner who alleges excessive\nforce at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing\nmore than de minimis injury can state a claim under the\nEighth Amendment. Hudson thus turned the Eighth\nAmendment into \u201ca National Code of Prison Regulation,\u201d\n503 U. S., at 28 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Farmer, 511\nU. S., at 859 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), with\n\u201cfederal judges [acting as] superintendents of prison condi\ntions nationwide,\u201d id., at 860. Although neither the Con\nstitution nor our precedents require this result, no party\nto this case asks us to overrule Hudson. Accordingly, I\nconcur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n</pre>",
