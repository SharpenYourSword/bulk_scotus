CITY OF NEW YORK, \n\n                   NEW YORK\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08\u2013969.      Argued November 3, 2009\u2014Decided January 25, 2010\nRespondent New York City taxes the possession of cigarettes. Peti\n  tioner Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online to\n  residents of the City. Neither state nor city law requires out-of-state\n  sellers such as Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the City\u2019s tax; in\n  stead, the City must recover its tax on out-of-state sales directly from\n  the purchasers. But the Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378, requires\n  out-of-state sellers to submit customer information to the States into\n  which they ship cigarettes, and New York State has agreed to for\n  ward that information to the City. That information helps the City\n  track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes. Against\n  that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under the Racketeer Influ\n  enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), alleging that Hemi\u2019s\n  failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the State constituted mail\n  and wire fraud, which are defined as \u201cracketeering activit[ies],\u201d 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71961(1), subject to enforcement under civil RICO, \u00a71964(c).\n  The District Court dismissed the claims, but the Second Circuit va\n  cated the judgment and remanded. Among other things, the Court of\n  Appeals held that the City\u2019s asserted injury\u2014lost tax revenue\u2014came\n  about \u201cby reason of\u201d the predicate mail and wire frauds. It accord\n  ingly determined that the City had stated a valid RICO claim.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n541 F. 3d 425, reversed and remanded.\n    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court in part,\n  concluding that because the City cannot show that it lost tax revenue\n  \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged RICO violation, it cannot state a RICO\n  claim. Pp. 5\u201315.\n2              HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) To establish that an injury came about \u201cby reason of\u201d a RICO\n    violation, a plaintiff must show that a predicate offense \u201cnot only was\n    a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\u201d\n    Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,\n    268. Proximate cause for RICO purposes should be evaluated in light\n    of its common-law foundations; it thus requires \u201csome direct relation\n    between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\n    A link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindirec[t]\u201d is in\n    sufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n       The City\u2019s causal theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship\n    requirement. Indeed, the causal link here is far more attenuated\n    than the one the Court rejected as \u201cpurely contingent\u201d and \u201ctoo re\n    mote\u201d in Holmes. Id., at 271. According to the City, Hemi committed\n    fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the\n    required customer information to the State. Without the reports\n    from Hemi, the State could not pass on the information to the City,\n    even if it had been so inclined. Some of the customers legally obli\n    gated to pay the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\n    City did not receive the customer information, it could not determine\n    which customers had failed to pay the tax. The City thus could not\n    pursue those customers for payment. The City thereby was injured\n    in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.\n    As the Court reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency of the law,\n    in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step,\u201d id.,\n    at 271\u2013272, and that \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\n    proximate cause inquiries under RICO, e.g., ibid. Because the City\u2019s\n    causation theory requires the Court to move well beyond the first\n    step, that theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship require\n    ment.\n       The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the RICO claim re\n    jected in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 458\u2013461,\n    where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the\n    conduct giving rise to the fraud, see id., at 458. Indeed, the discon\n    nect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is\n    even sharper. In Anza, the same party had both engaged in the\n    harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. Here, the City\u2019s\n    theory of liability rests not just on separate actions, but separate ac\n    tions carried out by separate parties. The City\u2019s theory thus requires\n    that the Court extend RICO liability to situations where the defen\n    dant\u2019s fraud on the third party (the State) has made it easier for a\n    fourth party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the City).\n    Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused harm to the City\n    in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally ob\n    ligated to pay. Put simply, Hemi\u2019s obligation was to file Jenkins Act\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                        3\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  reports with the State, not the City, and the City\u2019s harm was directly\n  caused by the customers, not Hemi. The Court has never before\n  stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to\n  do so today. See, e.g., id., at 460\u2013461. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the\n  violation not merely as Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports with\n  the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the\n  City of tax revenue. But if the City could escape the proximate-cause\n  requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced\n  all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Court\u2019s RICO\n  proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule. That\n  precedent makes clear that \u201cthe compensable injury flowing from a\n  [RICO] violation . . . \u2018necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predi\n  cate acts.\u2019 \u201d Anza, supra, at 457. Because the only fraudulent con\n  duct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but\n  cannot, show that Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led\n  directly to its injuries.\n    The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem\n  nity Co., 553 U. S. ___. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 causation theory was\n  \u201cstraightforward\u201d: The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and\n  easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the\n  plaintiffs\u2019 injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there \u201cwere the only parties\n  injured by petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations,\u201d id., at ___; and there\n  were \u201cno independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury,\u201d id., at\n  ___. The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straightfor\n  ward: Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted in\n  jury. And in contrast to Bridge, where there were \u201cno independent\n  factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs\u2019] injury,\u201d id., at ___, here\n  there certainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the inde\n  pendent actions of third and even fourth parties.

CITY OF NEW YORK, \n\n                   NEW YORK\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 25, 2010] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt in part.\n   The City of New York taxes the possession of cigarettes.\nHemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online\nto residents of the City. Neither state nor city law re\u00ad\nquires Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the tax, and the\npurchasers seldom pay it on their own. Federal law,\nhowever, requires out-of-state vendors such as Hemi to\nsubmit customer information to the States into which they\nship the cigarettes.\n   Against that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(RICO), alleging that Hemi failed to file the required\ncustomer information with the State. That failure, the\nCity argues, constitutes mail and wire fraud, which caused\nit to lose tens of millions of dollars in unrecovered ciga\u00ad\nrette taxes. Because the City cannot show that it lost the\ntax revenue \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged RICO violation, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71964(c), we hold that the City cannot state a\nclaim under RICO. We therefore reverse the Court of\n2          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals\u2019 decision to the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  This case arises from a motion to dismiss, and so we\naccept as true the factual allegations in the City\u2019s second\namended complaint. See Leatherman v. Tarrant County\nNarcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.\n163, 164 (1993).\n  New York State authorizes the City of New York to\nimpose its own taxes on cigarettes. N. Y. Unconsol. Law\nAnn. \u00a79436(1) (West Supp. 2009). Under that authority,\nthe City has levied a $1.50 per pack tax on each standard\npack of cigarettes possessed within the City for sale or use.\nN. Y. C. Admin. Code \u00a711\u20131302(a) (2008); see also Record\nA1016. When purchasers buy cigarettes from in-state\nvendors, the seller is responsible for charging, collecting,\nand remitting the tax. N. Y. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7471(2) (West\nSupp. 2009). Out-of-state vendors, however, are not.\nIbid.; see City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc.,\n541 F. 3d 425, 432\u2013433 (CA2 2008). Instead, the City is\nresponsible for recovering, directly from the customers,\nuse taxes on cigarettes sold outside New York. That can\nbe difficult, as those customers are often reluctant to pay\nand tough to track down. One way the City can gather\ninformation that would assist it in collecting the back\ntaxes is through the Jenkins Act, 63 Stat. 884, as amended\nby 69 Stat. 627. That Act requires out-of-state cigarette\nsellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco\ntax administrators listing the name, address, and quantity\nof cigarettes purchased by state residents. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378.\n  New York State and the City have executed an agree\u00ad\nment under which both parties undertake to \u201ccooperate\nfully with each other and keep each other fully and\npromptly informed with reference to any person or trans\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The\nCity asserts that under that agreement, the State for\u00ad\nwards Jenkins Act information to the City. Id., at A998;\nSecond Amended Compl. \u00b654. That information helps the\nCity track down purchasers who do not pay their taxes.\nId., \u00b6\u00b658\u201359.\n   Hemi Group is a New Mexico company that sells ciga\u00ad\nrettes online. Hemi, however, does not file Jenkins Act\ninformation with the State. The City alleges that this\nfailure has cost it \u201ctens if not hundreds of millions of\ndollars a year in cigarette excise tax revenue.\u201d Record\nA996. Based on Hemi\u2019s failure to file the information with\nthe State, the City filed this federal RICO claim.\n                              B\n  RICO provides a private cause of action for \u201c[a]ny per\u00ad\nson injured in his business or property by reason of a\nviolation of section 1962 of this chapter.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71964(c). Section 1962, in turn, contains RICO\u2019s criminal\nprovisions. Specifically, \u00a71962(c), which the City invokes\nhere, makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities\nof which affect, interstate . . . commerce, to conduct or\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d \u201c[R]acketeering activity\u201d is defined to include a\nnumber of so-called predicate acts, including the two at\nissue in this case\u2014mail and wire fraud. See \u00a71961(1).\n  The City alleges that Hemi\u2019s \u201cinterstate sale of ciga\u00ad\nrettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports identify\u00ad\ning those sales\u201d constitute the RICO predicate offenses of\nmail and wire fraud in violation of \u00a71962(c), for which\n4          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71964(c) provides a private cause of action. Record A980.\nInvoking that private cause of action, the City asserts that\nit has suffered injury in the form of lost tax revenue\u2014its\n\u201cbusiness or property\u201d in RICO terms\u2014\u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s fraud.\n   Hemi does not contest the City\u2019s characterization of the\nJenkins Act violations as predicate offenses actionable\nunder \u00a71964(c). (We therefore assume, without deciding,\nthat failure to file Jenkins Act material can serve as a\nRICO predicate offense.) Instead, Hemi argues that the\nCity\u2019s asserted injury\u2014lost tax revenue\u2014is not \u201cbusiness\nor property\u201d under RICO, and that the City cannot show\nthat it suffered any injury \u201cby reason of\u201d the failure to file\nJenkins Act reports.\n   The District Court dismissed the City\u2019s RICO claims,\ndetermining that Hemi owner and officer Kai Gachupin\ndid not have an individual duty to file Jenkins Act reports,\nand thus could not have committed the alleged predicate\nacts. City of New York v. Nexicon, Inc., No. 03 CV 383\n(DAB), 2006 WL 647716, *7\u2013*8 (SDNY, Mar. 15, 2006).\nThe District Court therefore held that the City could not\nestablish that Hemi and Gachupin formed an \u201centerprise\u201d\nas required to establish RICO liability. Id., at *7\u2013*10.\nBecause it dismissed on that ground, the District Court\ndid not address whether the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue\nconstitutes an injury to its \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under\n\u00a71964, or whether that injury was caused \u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports.\n   The Second Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s judg\u00ad\nment and remanded for further proceedings. The Court of\nAppeals held that the City had established that Gachupin\nand Hemi operated as an \u201centerprise\u201d and that the enter\u00ad\nprise committed the predicate RICO acts of mail and wire\nfraud, based on the failure to file the Jenkins Act material\nwith the State. 541 F. 3d, at 447\u2013448. The court also\ndetermined that the City\u2019s asserted injury, lost tax reve\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnue, was \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under RICO. Id., at 444\u2013\n445. And that injury, the court concluded, came about \u201cby\nreason of\u201d the predicate mail and wire frauds. Id., at 440\u2013\n444. The City thus had stated a viable RICO claim.\nJudge Winter dissented on the ground that the alleged\nRICO violation was not the proximate cause of the City\u2019s\ninjury. Id., at 458\u2013461.\n   Hemi filed a petition for certiorari, asking this Court to\ndetermine whether the City had been \u201cdirectly injured in\nits \u2018business or property\u2019 \u201d by reason of the alleged mail\nand wire frauds. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted that peti\u00ad\ntion. 556 U. S. __ (2009).\n                             II\n  Though framed as a single question, Hemi\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari raises two distinct issues: First, whether a loss\nin tax revenue is \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71964(c); and second, whether the City\u2019s asserted injury\ncame about \u201cby reason of\u201d the allegedly fraudulent con\u00ad\nduct, as required by \u00a71964(c). We determine that the City\ncannot satisfy the causation requirement\u2014that any injury\nthe City suffered must be \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged\nfrauds\u2014and therefore do not decide whether the City\u2019s\nallegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its\n\u201cbusiness or property.\u201d\n                             A\n   In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n503 U. S. 258 (1992), we set forth the standard of causa\u00ad\ntion that applies to civil RICO claims. In that case, we\naddressed a RICO claim brought by Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) against defendants whom\nSIPC alleged had manipulated stock prices. Id., at 262\u2013\n263. SIPC had a duty to reimburse customers of certain\nregistered broker-dealers in the event the broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their financial obligations. Id., at\n6         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n261. When the conspiracy by the stock manipulators was\ndetected, stock prices collapsed, and two broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their obligations to their customers.\nSIPC, as insurer against that loss, ultimately was on the\nhook for nearly $13 million to cover the customers\u2019 claims.\nThe Court held that SIPC could not recover against the\nconspirators because it could not establish that it was\ninjured \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged fraud, as that phrase is\nused in RICO.\n   We explained that, to state a claim under civil RICO,\nthe plaintiff is required to show that a RICO predicate\noffense \u201cnot only was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but\nwas the proximate cause as well.\u201d Id., at 268. Proximate\ncause for RICO purposes, we made clear, should be evalu\u00ad\nated in light of its common-law foundations; proximate\ncause thus requires \u201csome direct relation between the\ninjury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\nA link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindi\u00ad\nrec[t]\u201d is insufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n   Applying that standard, we rejected SIPC\u2019s RICO claim.\nThe alleged conspiracy, we held, directly harmed only the\nbroker-dealers; SIPC\u2019s injury, on the other hand, was\n\u201cpurely contingent\u201d on that harm. Id., at 271. The con\u00ad\nnection between the alleged conspiracy and SIPC\u2019s injury\nwas therefore \u201ctoo remote\u201d to satisfy RICO\u2019s direct rela\u00ad\ntionship requirement. Ibid.\n   The City\u2019s causal theory is far more attenuated than the\none we rejected in Holmes. According to the City, Hemi\ncommitted fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and\nfailing to submit the required customer information to the\nState. Without the reports from Hemi, the State could not\npass on the information to the City, even if it had been so\ninclined. Some of the customers legally obligated to pay\nthe cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\nCity did not receive the customer information, the City\ncould not determine which customers had failed to pay the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntax. The City thus could not pursue those customers for\npayment. The City thereby was injured in the amount of\nthe portion of back taxes that were never collected. See\nRecord A996.\n   But as we reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency\nof the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go be\u00ad\nyond the first step.\u201d 503 U. S., at 271\u2013272 (quoting Asso\nciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 534 (1983), in turn quoting Southern Pacific Co.\nv. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918),\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Our cases confirm\nthat the \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\nproximate cause inquiries under RICO. Holmes, supra, at\n271\u2013272; see also Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity\nCo., 553 U. S. __, __ (2008) (slip op., at 18\u201319); Anza v.\nIdeal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 460\u2013461 (2006).\nBecause the City\u2019s theory of causation requires us to move\nwell beyond the first step, that theory cannot meet RICO\u2019s\ndirect relationship requirement.\n   Our decision in Anza, supra, confirms that the City\u2019s\ntheory of causation is far too indirect. There we consid\u00ad\nered a RICO claim brought by Ideal Steel Supply against\nits competitor, National Steel Supply. Ideal alleged that\nNational had defrauded New York State by failing to\ncharge and remit sales taxes, and that National was thus\nable to undercut Ideal\u2019s prices. The lower prices offered by\nNational, Ideal contended, allowed National to attract\ncustomers at Ideal\u2019s expense. Id., at 458.\n   Finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury\nsuffered to be \u201cattenuated,\u201d we rejected Ideal\u2019s claim. Id.,\nat 459. \u201cThe direct victim of this conduct,\u201d we held, was\n\u201cthe State of New York, not Ideal.\u201d Id., at 458. \u201cIt was the\nState that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax\nrevenue as a result.\u201d Ibid. We recognized that Ideal had\nasserted \u201cits own harms when [National] failed to charge\ncustomers for the applicable sales tax.\u201d Ibid. But the\n8          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause of Ideal\u2019s harm was \u201ca set of actions (offering lower\nprices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation\n(defrauding the State).\u201d Ibid. The alleged violation there\u00ad\nfore had not \u201cled directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries,\u201d and\nIdeal accordingly had failed to meet RICO\u2019s \u201crequirement\nof a direct causal connection\u201d between the predicate of\u00ad\nfense and the alleged harm. Id., at 460\u2013461.\n   The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the\nclaim in Anza. Here, the conduct directly responsible for\nthe City\u2019s harm was the customers\u2019 failure to pay their\ntaxes. And the conduct constituting the alleged fraud was\nHemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports. Thus, as in\nAnza, the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct\nfrom the conduct giving rise to the fraud. See id., at 458.\n   Indeed, the disconnect between the asserted injury and\nthe alleged fraud in this case is even sharper than in\nAnza. There, we viewed the point as important because\nthe same party\u2014National Steel\u2014had both engaged in the\nharmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. We\nnevertheless found the distinction between the relevant\nacts sufficient to defeat Ideal\u2019s RICO claim. Here, the\nCity\u2019s theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,\nbut separate actions carried out by separate parties.\n   The City\u2019s theory thus requires that we extend RICO\nliability to situations where the defendant\u2019s fraud on the\nthird party (the State) has made it easier for a fourth\nparty (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the\nCity). Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused\nharm to the City in the first place if they decided not to\npay taxes they were legally obligated to pay. Put simply,\nHemi\u2019s obligation was to file the Jenkins Act reports with\nthe State, not the City, and the City\u2019s harm was directly\ncaused by the customers, not Hemi. We have never before\nstretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and\nwe decline to do so today. See id., at 460\u2013461; cf. Associ\nated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 541, n. 46 (finding no\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The State certainly is\nbetter situated than the City to seek recovery from Hemi.\nAnd the State has an incentive to sue\u2014the State imposes\nits own $2.75 per pack tax on cigarettes possessed within\nthe State, nearly double what the City charges. N. Y. Tax\nLaw Ann. \u00a7471(1) (West Supp. 2009). We do not opine on\nwhether the State could bring a RICO action for any lost\ntax revenue. Suffice it to say that the State would have\nconcrete incentives to try. See Anza, supra, at 460 (\u201cIdeal\naccuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out\nof a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are\ntrue, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate\nremedies\u201d).\n   The dissent would have RICO\u2019s proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement turn on foreseeability, rather than on the exis\u00ad\ntence of a sufficiently \u201cdirect relationship\u201d between the\nfraud and the harm. It would find that the City has satis\u00ad\nfied that requirement because \u201cthe harm is foreseeable; it\nis a consequence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and\nit falls well within the set of risks that Congress sought to\nprevent.\u201d Post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). If this line of\nreasoning sounds familiar, it should. It is precisely the\nargument lodged against the majority opinion in Anza.\nThere, the dissent criticized the majority\u2019s view for \u201cper\u00ad\nmit[ting] a defendant to evade liability for harms that are\nnot only foreseeable, but the intended consequences of\nthe defendant\u2019s unlawful behavior.\u201d 547 U. S., at 470\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut the dissent there did not carry the day, and no one\nhas asked us to revisit Anza.\n10           HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are\nof course two of the \u201cmany shapes [proximate cause] took\nat common law,\u201d Holmes, supra, at 268. Our precedents\nmake clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the\ndirectness of the relationship between the conduct and the\nharm. Indeed, Anza and Holmes never even mention the\nconcept of foreseeability.\n                             B\n   The City offers a number of responses. It first chal\u00ad\nlenges our characterization of the violation at issue. In\nthe City\u2019s view, the violation is not merely Hemi\u2019s failure\nto file Jenkins Act information with the State, but a more\ngeneral \u201csystematic scheme to defraud the City of tax\nrevenue.\u201d Brief for Respondent 42. Having broadly de\u00ad\nfined the violation, the City contends that it has been\ndirectly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.\nIbid.\n   But the City cannot escape the proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme\nembraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged con\u00ad\nduct. Otherwise our RICO proximate cause precedent\nwould become a mere pleading rule. In Anza, for example,\nIdeal alleged that National\u2019s scheme \u201cwas to give National\na competitive advantage over Ideal.\u201d 547 U. S., at 454\u2013\n455. But that allegation did not prevent the Court from\nconcluding that National\u2019s fraud directly harmed only the\nState, not Ideal. As the Court explained, Ideal could not\n\u201ccircumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by\nclaiming that the defendant\u2019s aim was to increase market\nshare at a competitor\u2019s expense.\u201d Id., at 460.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even if we were willing to look to Hemi\u2019s intent, as the dissent sug\u00ad\n\ngests we should, the City would fare no better. Hemi\u2019s aim was not to\ndefraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to\nsell more cigarettes. Hemi itself neither owed taxes nor was obliged to\ncollect and remit them. This all suggests that Hemi\u2019s alleged fraud was\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our precedent makes clear, moreover, that \u201cthe com\u00ad\npensable injury flowing from a [RICO] violation . . . \u2018neces\u00ad\nsarily is the harm caused by [the] predicate acts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n457 (quoting Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.\n479, 497 (1985)). In its RICO statement, the City alleged\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports constituted\nthe predicate act of mail and wire fraud. Record A980.\nThe City went on to allege that this predicate act \u201cdirectly\ncaused\u201d its harm, id., at A996, but that assertion is a legal\nconclusion about proximate cause\u2014indeed, the very legal\nconclusion before us. The only fraudulent conduct alleged\nhere is a violation of the Jenkins Act. See 541 F. 3d, at\n459 (Winter, J., dissenting). Thus, the City must show\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the\nState led directly to its injuries. This it cannot do.\n   The City also relies on Bridge, 553 U. S. ___. Bridge\nreaffirmed the requirement that there must be \u201ca suffi\u00ad\nciently direct relationship between the defendant\u2019s wrong\u00ad\nful conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18). The case involved competing bidders at a county\ntax-lien auction. Because the liens were profitable even at\nthe lowest possible bid, multiple bidders offered that low\nbid. (The bidding took the form of the percentage tax\npenalty the bidder would require the property owner to\npay, so the lowest possible bid was 0%.) To decide which\nbidder would be awarded the lien, the county devised a\nplan to allocate the liens \u201con a rotational basis.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nas we noted in that case, this created a \u201cperverse incen\u00ad\ntive\u201d: \u201cBidders who, in addition to bidding themselves,\nsen[t] agents to bid on their behalf [would] obtain a dis\u00ad\nproportionate share of liens.\u201d Ibid. The county therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\naimed at Hemi\u2019s competitors, not the City. But Anza teaches that the\n\ncompetitors\u2019 injuries in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO\n\nclaim.\n\n12         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprohibited bidders from using such agents. Ibid.\n   A losing bidder alleged that a competitor had defrauded\nthe county by employing shadow bidders to secure a\ngreater proportion of liens than it was due. We held that\nthe bidder-plaintiff had met RICO\u2019s causation require\u00ad\nment. Distinguishing that claim from the one at issue in\nAnza, we noted that the plaintiff\u2019s theory of causation in\nBridge was \u201cstraightforward\u201d: Because of the zero-sum\nnature of the auction, and because the county awarded\nbids on a rotational basis, each time a fraud-induced bid\nwas awarded, a particular legitimate bidder was necessar\u00ad\nily passed over. 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The\nlosing bidders, moreover, \u201cwere the only parties injured by\npetitioners\u2019 misrepresentations.\u201d Ibid. The county was\nnot; it received the same revenue regardless of which\nbidder prevailed.\n   The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straight\u00ad\nforward: Multiple steps, as we have detailed, separate the\nalleged fraud from the asserted injury. And in contrast to\nBridge, where there were \u201cno independent factors that\naccount[ed] for [the plaintiff\u2019s] injury,\u201d ibid., here there\ncertainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the\nindependent actions of third and even fourth parties.\n   The City at various points during the proceedings below\ndescribed its injury as the lost \u201copportunity to tax\u201d rather\nthan \u201clost tax revenue.\u201d It is not clear that there is a\nsubstantive distinction between the two descriptions. In\nany event, before this Court, the City\u2019s argument turned\non lost revenue, not a lost opportunity to collect it. See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondent i (\u201cCounter-Question Pre\u00ad\nsented[:] Does the City of New York have standing under\nRICO because lost tax revenue constitutes a direct injury\nto the City\u2019s \u2018business or property\u2019 in accord with the\nstatute, 18 U.

Brief for\nPetitioners 25 (\u201cThe opportunity to collect taxes from\nthose who did owe them . . . falls within a class of expecta\u00ad\ntion interests that do not qualify as injury to business or\nproperty and therefore do not confer civil RICO standing\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see Cleveland v.\nUnited States, 531 U. S. 12, 15 (2000) (\u201cIt does not suffice\n. . . that the object of the fraud may become property in the\nrecipient\u2019s hands; for purposes of the mail fraud statute,\nthe thing obtained must be property in the hands of the\nvictim\u201d).\n    That is not to say, however, that the City would fare any\nbetter on the causation question had it framed its argu\u00ad\nment in terms of a lost opportunity. Hemi\u2019s filing obliga\u00ad\ntion would still be to the State, and any harm to the City\nwould still be caused directly by the customers\u2019 failure to\npay their taxes. See 541 F. 3d, at 461 (Winter, J., dissent\u00ad\ning). Whatever the City\u2019s reasons for framing its merits\narguments as it has, we will not reformulate them for it\nnow.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dissent recognizes that its position poses the troubling specter\nof turning RICO into a tax collection statute. Post, at 11\u201312 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). The dissent\u2019s answer looks largely to prosecution policy set\nforth in the Federal Department of Justice Guidelines, which are, of\ncourse, not only changeable, but have no applicability whatever to state\nor local governments. Under the decision below and the dissent\u2019s\nposition, RICO could be used as a tax collection device based solely on\nthe failure to file reports under the Jenkins Act, which itself provides\nquite limited remedies. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7377 (providing that a violation\nof the Jenkins Act may be punished as a misdemeanor with a fine up to\n$1,000 and imprisonment for no more than six months). And that\n14          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  In a final effort to save its claim, the City has shifted\ncourse before this Court. In its second amended complaint\nand RICO statement, the City relied solely on Hemi\u2019s\nfailure to file Jenkins Act reports with the State to form\nthe basis of the predicate act mail and wire frauds. See\nSecond Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b699, 101, 118, 125; Record\nA980\u2013A982. Before this Court, however, the City con\u00ad\ntends that Hemi made affirmative misrepresentations to\nCity residents, which, the City now argues, comprise part\nof the RICO predicate mail and wire frauds. See Brief for\nRespondent 42\u201343. The City\u2019s counsel pressed the point at\noral argument, asserting that the City\u2019s injury was\n\u201ccaused by the seller\u2019s misrepresentation, which encour\u00ad\nages the purchasers not to pay taxes.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\n  The City, however, affirmatively disavowed below any\nreliance on misrepresentations to form the predicate RICO\nviolation. The alleged false statements, the City there\nstated, \u201care evidence of the scheme to defraud, but are not\npart of the fraud itself. . . . [T]he scheme to defraud would\nexist even absent the statements.\u201d Record A980. The City\nreiterated the point: \u201cThe scheme consists of the interstate\nsale of cigarettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports\nindentifying those sales.\u201d Ibid. \u201cRelated to the fraud, but\nnot a circumstance \u2018constituting\u2019 the fraud, the defendants\ninform customers that [their] purchases will be concealed,\nand also seek to convince their customers that no taxes are\nowed by claiming, falsely, that the sales are tax-free.\u201d Id.,\nat A982. Not only did the City disclaim any reliance upon\nmisrepresentations to the customers to form the predicate\nacts under RICO, but the City made clear in its second\namended complaint that its two RICO claims rested solely\non the Jenkins Act violations as the predicate acts. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndevice would be available not only to the State, to which the reports\n\nwere due, but also to the City, to which Hemi owed no duty under the \n\nAct and to which it owed no taxes.\n\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Because the City\ndefined the predicate act before the District Court as\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports, and ex\u00ad\npressly disavowed reliance on the alleged misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions themselves as predicate acts, we decline to consider\nHemi\u2019s alleged misstatements as predicate acts at this late\nstage.\n                          *     *    *\n   It bears remembering what this case is about. It is\nabout the RICO liability of a company for lost taxes it had\nno obligation to collect, remit, or pay, which harmed a\nparty to whom it owed no duty. It is about imposing such\nliability to substitute for or complement a governing body\u2019s\nuncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from\nthose who owe them. And it is about the fact that the\nliability comes with treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees\nattached. This Court has interpreted RICO broadly,\nconsistent with its terms, but we have also held that its\nreach is limited by the \u201crequirement of a direct causal\nconnection\u201d between the predicate wrong and the harm.\nAnza, 547 U. S., at 460. The City\u2019s injuries here were not\ncaused directly by the alleged fraud, and thus were not\ncaused \u201cby reason of\u201d it. The City, therefore, has no RICO\nclaim.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

As\nthe majority points out, ante, at 3, the Racketeer Influ\u00ad\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71961\u20131968, provides a private cause of action (and\ntreble damages) to \u201c[a]ny person injured in\u201d that person\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness or property by reason of\u201d conduct that involves a\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71964(c) (emphasis\nadded), 1962. RICO defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to\ninclude violations of various predicate criminal statutes\nincluding mail and wire fraud. \u00a71961(1). The \u201cpattern of\nracketeering\u201d at issue here consists of repeated instances\nof mail fraud, which in turn consist largely of violations of\nthe federal Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378. That Act\n2          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nseeks to help States collect tobacco taxes by requiring out\u00ad\nof-state cigarette sellers, such as Hemi, to file reports with\nstate tobacco tax administrators identifying the names\nand addresses of in-state customers and the amounts they\npurchased. The violations consist of Hemi\u2019s intentional\nfailure to do so.\n  As the majority points out, we must assume for present\npurposes that an intentional failure to file Jenkins Act\nreports counts as mail fraud (at least where the failure is\npart of a scheme that includes use of the mails). Ante, at\n4. Lower courts have sometimes so held. See United\nStates v. Melvin, 544 F. 2d 767, 773\u2013777 (CA5 1977);\nUnited States v. Brewer, 528 F. 2d 492, 497\u2013498 (CA4\n1975). The Court of Appeals here so held. City of New\nYork v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 446 (CA2\n2008). And no one has challenged that holding.\n  We must also assume that Hemi\u2019s \u201cintentiona[l] con\u00ad\nceal[ment]\u201d of the name/address/purchase information,\nSecond Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6103, 104, is the legal equivalent of\nan affirmative representation that Hemi had no New York\nCity customers. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7551,\np. 119 (1976) (a person \u201cwho fails to disclose . . . a fact\u201d\nmay be \u201csubject to . . . liability\u201d as if \u201che had represented\nthe nonexistence of the matter that he has failed to dis\u00ad\nclose\u201d); cf.

On these\nassumptions, the question before us is whether New York\nCity\u2019s loss of tax revenues constitutes an injury to its\n\u201cbusiness or property by reason of\u201d Hemi\u2019s Jenkins Act\nmisrepresentations.\n                            B\n  The case arises as a result of the District Court\u2019s dis\u00ad\nmissal of New York City\u2019s RICO complaint.

Bridge v.\nPhoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1\n(2008) (slip op., at 1, n. 1). Those facts (as I interpret\nthem) include the following:\n  1. New York State (or State) and New York City (or City)\n     both impose tobacco taxes on New York cigarette buy\u00ad\n     ers. Second Am. Compl. \u00b637.\n  2. Both City and State normally collect the taxes from\n     in-state cigarette sellers, who, in turn, charge retail\n     customers. Id., \u00b6\u00b64, 6.\n  3. Hemi, an out-of-state company, sells cigarettes over\n     the Internet to in-state buyers at prices that are lower\n     than in-state cigarette prices. The difference in price\n     is almost entirely attributable to the fact that Hemi\u2019s\n     prices do not include any charge for New York taxes.\n     Hemi advertises its cigarettes as \u201ctax free\u201d and often\n     adds that it \u201cdoes not report any sales activity to any\n     State taxing authority.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b62, 6, 108b (internal\n     quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).\n  4. New York State normally receives Jenkins Act reports\n     from out-of-state sellers. It is contractually obliged to\n     pass the information on to New York City (and I as\u00ad\n     sume it normally does so). Id., \u00b6\u00b68\u20139, 11, 54\u201357.\n  5. When it receives Jenkins-Act-type information, New\n     York City writes letters to resident customers asking\n     them to pay the tobacco tax they owe. As a result,\n     New York City collects about 40% of the tax due. (By\n     doing so, in 2005 the City obtained $400,000 out of $1\n     million owed.) Id., \u00b6\u00b658\u201359.\n  6. Hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file\n     Jenkins Act reports in order to prevent both State and\n     City from collecting the tobacco taxes that Hemi\u2019s in\u00ad\n     state customers owe and which otherwise many of\n     those customers would pay. Id., \u00b6\u00b613, 24, 58.\n4          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   The majority asks whether New York City stated a valid\ncause of action in alleging that it lost tobacco tax revenue\n\u201cby reason of\u201d Hemi\u2019s unlawful misrepresentations. The\nfacts just set forth make clear that we must answer that\nquestion affirmatively. For one thing, no one denies that\nHemi\u2019s misrepresentation was a \u201cbut-for\u201d condition of New\nYork City\u2019s loss. In the absence of the misrepresentation,\ni.e., had Hemi told New York State the truth about its\nNew York City customers, New York City would have\nwritten letters to the purchasers and obtained a signifi\u00ad\ncant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.\n   For another thing, New York City\u2019s losses are \u201creasona\u00ad\nbly foreseeable\u201d results of the misrepresentation. It is\nforeseeable that, without the name/address/purchase\ninformation, New York City would not be able to write\nsuccessful dunning letters, and it is foreseeable that, with\nthat information, it would be able to write successful\ndunning letters. Indeed, that is a natural inference from,\namong other things, the complaint\u2019s assertion that Hemi\nadvertised that it did not \u201creport\u201d sales information to\n\u201cState taxing authorit[ies].\u201d See, e.g., Smith v. Bolles, 132\nU. S. 125, 130 (1889) (for causation purposes, \u201c \u2018those\nresults are proximate which the wrong-doer from his\nposition must have contemplated as the probable conse\u00ad\nquence of his fraud or breach of contract\u2019 \u201d (quoting Crater\nv.

It\nknew the loss would occur; it intended the loss to occur;\none might even say it desired the loss to occur. It is diffi\u00ad\ncult to find common-law cases denying liability for a\nwrongdoer\u2019s intended consequences, particularly where\nthose consequences are also foreseeable. Cf.

I\nhave no reason to believe the Act intends any different\nresult with respect to collection of a city\u2019s tobacco tax\nassessed under the authority of state law. See N. Y. Un\u00ad\nconsol.

Holmes v. Securities\nInvestor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 267, 268\n(1992). I can find no antitrust analogy that suggests any\nlack of causation here, nor has the majority referred to\nany such analogical antitrust circumstance.\n  The upshot is that the harm is foreseeable; it is a conse\u00ad\nquence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and it falls\nwell within the set of risks that Congress sought to pre\u00ad\nvent. Neither antitrust analogy nor any statutory policy of\nwhich I am aware precludes a finding of \u201cproximate\ncause.\u201d I recognize that some of our opinions may be read\nto suggest that the words \u201cby reason of\u201d in RICO do not\nperfectly track common-law notions of proximate cause.\nSee, e.g., Bridge, 553 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 14\u201316).\nBut where so much basic common law argues in favor of\nsuch a finding, how can the Court avoid that conclusion\nhere?\n                            B\n  The majority bases its contrary conclusion upon three\nspecial circumstances and its reading of two of this Court\u2019s\nprior cases. In my view, none of the three circumstances\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprecludes finding causation (indeed two are not even\nrelevant to the causation issue). Nor can I find the two\nprior cases controlling.\n   The three circumstances are the following: First, the\nmajority seems to argue that the intervening voluntary\nacts of third parties, namely, the customers\u2019 own inde\u00ad\npendent failures to pay the tax, cuts the causal chain.\nAnte, at 8 (\u201c[T]he City\u2019s harm was directly caused by the\ncustomers, not Hemi\u201d); see Saugerties Bank v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 236 N. Y. 425, 430, 141 N. E. 904, 905 (1923)\n(third party\u2019s forgery of a bill of lading an intervening\ncause); Prosser and Keeton \u00a744, at 313\u2013314 (collecting\ncases on intervening intentional or criminal acts). But an\nintervening third-party act, even if criminal, does not cut a\ncausal chain where the intervening act is foreseeable and\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct increases the risk of its occur\u00ad\nrence. See Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, 462 (1947)\n(per curiam); Horan v. Watertown, 217 Mass. 185, 186, 104\nN. E. 464, 465 (1914); see also Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7435A, at 454 (1963\u20131964) (intentional tortfeasor\nliable for intended harm \u201cexcept where the harm results\nfrom an outside force the risk of which is not increased by\nthe defendant\u2019s act\u201d). Hemi\u2019s act here did increase the\nrisk that New York City would not be paid; and not only\nwas the risk foreseeable, but Hemi\u2019s advertising strongly\nsuggests that Hemi actually knew nonreporting would\nlikely bring about this very harm.\n   The majority claims that \u201cdirectness,\u201d rather than fore\u00ad\nseeability, should be our guide in assessing proximate\ncause, and that the lack of a \u201cdirect\u201d relationship in this\ncase precludes a finding of proximate causation. Ante, at\n9\u201310. But courts used this concept of directness in tort\nlaw to expand liability (for direct consequences) beyond\nwhat was foreseeable, not to eliminate liability for what\nwas foreseeable. Thus, under the \u201cdirectness\u201d theory of\nproximate causation, there is liability for both \u201call \u2018direct\u2019\n8         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(or \u2018directly traceable\u2019) consequences and those indirect\nconsequences that are foreseeable.\u201d Prosser and Keeton\n\u00a742, at 273 (emphasis added); see also id., \u00a743, at 294, and\nn. 17 (citing Nunan v. Bennett, 184 Ky. 591, 212 S. W.\n570 (1919)). I do not read this Court\u2019s opinions in\nHolmes or Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451\n(2006), to invoke anything other than this traditional\nunderstanding.\n   Second, the majority correctly points out that Hemi\nmisrepresented the situation to the State, not to the\nCity\u2014a circumstance which, the majority believes, signifi\u00ad\ncantly separates misrepresentation from harm. Ante, at 8.\nBut how could that be so? New York State signed a con\u00ad\ntract promising to relay relevant information to the City.\nIn respect to that relevant information, the State is a\nconduit, indeed roughly analogous to a postal employee.\nThis Court has recognized specifically that \u201cunder the\ncommon law a fraud may be established when the defen\u00ad\ndant has made use of a third party to reach the target of\nthe fraud.\u201d Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 129\n(1987). The treatises say the same. See, e.g., Prosser and\nKeeton \u00a7107, at 743\u2013745; 26 C. J. S., Fraud \u00a747, p. 1121\n(1921) (collecting cases); see also Prosser, Misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion and Third Parties, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240\u2013241,\nand nn. 56\u201359, 62\u201364 (1966) (collecting cases). This Court\nhas never suggested the contrary, namely, that a defen\u00ad\ndant is not liable for (foreseeable) harm (intentionally)\ncaused to the target of a scheme to defraud simply because\nthe misrepresentation was transmitted via a third (or even\na fourth or fifth) party. Cf. Terry, Intent to Defraud, 25\nYale L. J. 87, 93 (1915) (\u201cWhen a representation is com\u00ad\nmunicated through one person to another in such circum\u00ad\nstances that it can be deemed to be directed to the latter,\nit makes no difference through how many persons or by\nhow circuitous a route it reaches the latter . . .\u201d).\n   Third, the majority places great weight upon its view\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat Hemi tried to defraud the State, not the City. Ante,\nat 8\u20139. Hemi, however, sought to defraud both. Third\nAmended RICO Statement \u00b6d (explaining that \u201c[e]very\nother State or local government that imposes a use tax on\ncigarettes and whose residents purchase cigarettes\u201d from\nHemi is a victim of its scheme to defraud). Hemi sought to\nprevent the State from collecting state taxes; and it sought\nto prevent the City from collecting city taxes. Here we are\nconcerned only with the latter. In respect to the latter, the\nState was an information conduit. The fact that state\ntaxes were also involved is beside the point.\n   The two Supreme Court cases to which the majority\nrefers involve significantly different causal circumstances.\nAnte, at 5\u20138. The predicate acts in Holmes\u2014the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s acts that led to the plaintiff\u2019s harm\u2014consisted of\nsecurities frauds. The defendant misrepresented the\nprospects of one company and misled the investing public\ninto falsely believing that it could readily buy and sell the\nstock of another. When the truth came out, stock prices\nfell, investors (specifically, stockbrokers) lost money, and\nsince the stockbrokers could not pay certain creditors,\nthose creditors also lost money. 503 U. S., at 262\u2013263.\nClaiming subrogation to stand in the shoes of the credi\u00ad\ntors, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation sued.\nId., at 270\u2013271.\n   Since the creditors had not bought the securities, there\nwas little reason to believe the defendant intended their\nharm. And the securities statutes seek, first and foremost,\nto protect investors, not creditors of those who sell stock to\nthose investors. The latter harm (a broker\u2019s creditor\u2019s\nloss) differs in kind from the harm that the \u201cpredicate act\u201d\nstatute primarily seeks to avoid and that its violation\nwould ordinarily cause (namely, investors\u2019 stock-related\nmonetary losses). As Part II\u2013A, supra, points out, neither\nof these circumstances is present here.\n   In Anza, the plaintiff was a business competitor of the\n10         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndefendants. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants\nfalsely told state officials that they did not owe sales tax.\nThe plaintiff added that, had the defendants paid the tax\nthey owed, the defendants would have had less money\navailable to run their business, and the plaintiff conse\u00ad\nquently would have been able to compete against them\nmore effectively. 547 U. S., at 454, 457\u2013458.\n   Again, in Anza the kind of harm that the plaintiff al\u00ad\nleged is not the kind of harm that the tax statutes primar\u00ad\nily seek to prevent. Rather, it alleged a kind of harm\n(competitive injury) that tax violations do not ordinarily\ncause and which ordinarily flows from the regular opera\u00ad\ntion of a competitive marketplace. Thus, in both Holmes\nand Anza, unlike the present case, plaintiffs alleged spe\u00ad\ncial harm, neither squarely within the class of harms at\nwhich the relevant statutes were directed, nor of a kind\nthat typical violators would intend or even foresee.\n   Bridge, which the majority seeks to distinguish, ante, at\n11\u201312, is a more closely analogous case. The defendants\nin that case directed agents to misrepresent to a county\nthat they qualified as independent bidders at a county-run\nproperty auction. They consequently participated in the\nauction. And the plaintiffs, facing additional bidders, lost\nsome of the property that they otherwise would have\nwon\u2014all to their financial disadvantage. 553 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134). The harm was foreseeable; it\nwas intended; and it was precisely the kind of harm that\nthe county\u2019s bidding rules sought to prevent. Thus this\nCourt held that the harm was \u201ca foreseeable and natural\nconsequence of [the defendants\u2019] scheme.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   In sum, the majority recognizes that \u201c[p]roximate cause\nfor RICO purposes . . . should be evaluated in light of its\ncommon law foundations,\u201d ante, at 6, but those founda\u00ad\ntions do not support the majority\u2019s view.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Salmonese, 352 F. 3d 608, 612 (CA2\n2003). They deliberately and repeatedly make egregiously\nfraudulent misrepresentations to inflate the price of secu\u00ad\nrities that, unbeknownst to investors, they own. After the\nstock price rises, the defendants sell at an artificial profit.\nWhen the fraud is revealed, the price crashes, to the inves\u00ad\ntors\u2019 detriment. Suppose the defendants have intention\u00ad\nally spoken directly only to intermediaries who simply\nrepeated the information to potential investors, and have\nnot had any contact with the investors themselves. Under\nthe majority\u2019s reasoning, these defendants apparently did\nnot proximately cause the investors\u2019 losses and are not\nliable under RICO.\n                             III\n   If there is causation, we must decide whether, for RICO\npurposes, the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue is \u201c \u2018business or\nproperty\u2019 under 18 U.

Some fear that\nan affirmative answer would turn RICO into a tax collec\u00ad\ntion statute, permitting States to bring RICO actions and\nrecover treble damages for behavior that amounts to no\nmore than a failure to pay taxes due. See, e.g., Michigan,\nDept. of Treasury, Revenue Div. v.

And those guidelines specify\nthat the Department will grant that approval only where\nthere is at issue \u201ca large fraud loss or a substantial\npattern of conduct\u201d and will not do so, absent \u201cunusual\ncircumstances,\u201d in cases involving simply \u201cone person\u2019s\ntax liability.\u201d Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019\nManual \u00a76\u20134.210(A) (2007), online at http://www.justice.\ngov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title6/4mtax.htm\n(as visited Jan. 20, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file); see also \u00a76\u20134.210(B) (explaining that the De\u00ad\npartment \u201cwill not authorize the use of mail, wire or bank\nfraud charges to convert routine tax prosecutions into\nRICO . . . cases\u201d).\n   This case involves an extensive pattern of fraudulent\nconduct, large revenue losses, and many different unre\u00ad\nlated potential taxpayers. The Department\u2019s guidelines\nwould appear to authorize prosecution in these circum\u00ad\nstances.

But that case\ninvolved not a loss of tax revenues, but \u201cinjury to the\ngeneral economy of a State\u201d\u2014insofar as it was threatened\nby violations of antitrust law. Id., at 260. Hawaii\u2019s inter\u00ad\nest, both more general and derivative of harm to individ\u00ad\nual businesses, differs significantly from the particular tax\nloss at issue in Pasquantino and directly at issue here.\n   We have previously made clear that the compensable\ninjury for RICO purposes is the harm caused by the predi\u00ad\ncate acts. See generally Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,\n473 U. S. 479, 495\u2013496 (1985); cf. Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000).

And I would\nfind in the respondent\u2019s favor here.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n",

Argued November 3, 2009\u2014Decided January 25, 2010\nRespondent New York City taxes the possession of cigarettes. Peti\n  tioner Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online to\n  residents of the City. Neither state nor city law requires out-of-state\n  sellers such as Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the City\u2019s tax; in\n  stead, the City must recover its tax on out-of-state sales directly from\n  the purchasers. But the Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378, requires\n  out-of-state sellers to submit customer information to the States into\n  which they ship cigarettes, and New York State has agreed to for\n  ward that information to the City. That information helps the City\n  track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes. Against\n  that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under the Racketeer Influ\n  enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), alleging that Hemi\u2019s\n  failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the State constituted mail\n  and wire fraud, which are defined as \u201cracketeering activit[ies],\u201d 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71961(1), subject to enforcement under civil RICO, \u00a71964(c).\n  The District Court dismissed the claims, but the Second Circuit va\n  cated the judgment and remanded. Among other things, the Court of\n  Appeals held that the City\u2019s asserted injury\u2014lost tax revenue\u2014came\n  about \u201cby reason of\u201d the predicate mail and wire frauds. It accord\n  ingly determined that the City had stated a valid RICO claim.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n541 F. 3d 425, reversed and remanded.\n    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court in part,\n  concluding that because the City cannot show that it lost tax revenue\n  \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged RICO violation, it cannot state a RICO\n  claim. Pp. 5\u201315.\n2              HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) To establish that an injury came about \u201cby reason of\u201d a RICO\n    violation, a plaintiff must show that a predicate offense \u201cnot only was\n    a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\u201d\n    Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,\n    268. Proximate cause for RICO purposes should be evaluated in light\n    of its common-law foundations; it thus requires \u201csome direct relation\n    between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\n    A link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindirec[t]\u201d is in\n    sufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n       The City\u2019s causal theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship\n    requirement. Indeed, the causal link here is far more attenuated\n    than the one the Court rejected as \u201cpurely contingent\u201d and \u201ctoo re\n    mote\u201d in Holmes. Id., at 271. According to the City, Hemi committed\n    fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the\n    required customer information to the State. Without the reports\n    from Hemi, the State could not pass on the information to the City,\n    even if it had been so inclined. Some of the customers legally obli\n    gated to pay the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\n    City did not receive the customer information, it could not determine\n    which customers had failed to pay the tax. The City thus could not\n    pursue those customers for payment. The City thereby was injured\n    in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.\n    As the Court reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency of the law,\n    in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step,\u201d id.,\n    at 271\u2013272, and that \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\n    proximate cause inquiries under RICO, e.g., ibid. Because the City\u2019s\n    causation theory requires the Court to move well beyond the first\n    step, that theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship require\n    ment.\n       The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the RICO claim re\n    jected in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 458\u2013461,\n    where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the\n    conduct giving rise to the fraud, see id., at 458. Indeed, the discon\n    nect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is\n    even sharper. In Anza, the same party had both engaged in the\n    harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. Here, the City\u2019s\n    theory of liability rests not just on separate actions, but separate ac\n    tions carried out by separate parties. The City\u2019s theory thus requires\n    that the Court extend RICO liability to situations where the defen\n    dant\u2019s fraud on the third party (the State) has made it easier for a\n    fourth party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the City).\n    Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused harm to the City\n    in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally ob\n    ligated to pay. Put simply, Hemi\u2019s obligation was to file Jenkins Act\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The Court has never before\n  stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to\n  do so today. See, e.g., id., at 460\u2013461. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the\n  violation not merely as Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports with\n  the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the\n  City of tax revenue. But if the City could escape the proximate-cause\n  requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced\n  all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Court\u2019s RICO\n  proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule. That\n  precedent makes clear that \u201cthe compensable injury flowing from a\n  [RICO] violation . . . \u2018necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predi\n  cate acts.\u2019 \u201d Anza, supra, at 457. Because the only fraudulent con\n  duct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but\n  cannot, show that Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led\n  directly to its injuries.\n    The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem\n  nity Co., 553 U. S. ___. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 causation theory was\n  \u201cstraightforward\u201d: The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and\n  easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the\n  plaintiffs\u2019 injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there \u201cwere the only parties\n  injured by petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations,\u201d id., at ___; and there\n  were \u201cno independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury,\u201d id., at\n  ___. The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straightfor\n  ward: Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted in\n  jury. And in contrast to Bridge, where there were \u201cno independent\n  factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs\u2019] injury,\u201d id., at ___, here\n  there certainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the inde\n  pendent actions of third and even fourth parties.

Neither state nor city law re\u00ad\nquires Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the tax, and the\npurchasers seldom pay it on their own. Federal law,\nhowever, requires out-of-state vendors such as Hemi to\nsubmit customer information to the States into which they\nship the cigarettes.\n   Against that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(RICO), alleging that Hemi failed to file the required\ncustomer information with the State. That failure, the\nCity argues, constitutes mail and wire fraud, which caused\nit to lose tens of millions of dollars in unrecovered ciga\u00ad\nrette taxes. Because the City cannot show that it lost the\ntax revenue \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged RICO violation, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71964(c), we hold that the City cannot state a\nclaim under RICO. We therefore reverse the Court of\n2          HEMI GROUP, LLC v.

See Leatherman v. Tarrant County\nNarcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.\n163, 164 (1993).\n  New York State authorizes the City of New York to\nimpose its own taxes on cigarettes. N. Y. Unconsol. Law\nAnn. \u00a79436(1) (West Supp. 2009). Under that authority,\nthe City has levied a $1.50 per pack tax on each standard\npack of cigarettes possessed within the City for sale or use.\nN. Y. C. Admin. Code \u00a711\u20131302(a) (2008); see also Record\nA1016. When purchasers buy cigarettes from in-state\nvendors, the seller is responsible for charging, collecting,\nand remitting the tax. N. Y. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7471(2) (West\nSupp. 2009). Out-of-state vendors, however, are not.\nIbid.; see City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc.,\n541 F. 3d 425, 432\u2013433 (CA2 2008). Instead, the City is\nresponsible for recovering, directly from the customers,\nuse taxes on cigarettes sold outside New York. That can\nbe difficult, as those customers are often reluctant to pay\nand tough to track down. One way the City can gather\ninformation that would assist it in collecting the back\ntaxes is through the Jenkins Act, 63 Stat. 884, as amended\nby 69 Stat. 627. That Act requires out-of-state cigarette\nsellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco\ntax administrators listing the name, address, and quantity\nof cigarettes purchased by state residents. 15 U.

Specifically, \u00a71962(c), which the City invokes\nhere, makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities\nof which affect, interstate . . . commerce, to conduct or\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d \u201c[R]acketeering activity\u201d is defined to include a\nnumber of so-called predicate acts, including the two at\nissue in this case\u2014mail and wire fraud. See \u00a71961(1).\n  The City alleges that Hemi\u2019s \u201cinterstate sale of ciga\u00ad\nrettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports identify\u00ad\ning those sales\u201d constitute the RICO predicate offenses of\nmail and wire fraud in violation of \u00a71962(c), for which\n4          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71964(c) provides a private cause of action. Record A980.\nInvoking that private cause of action, the City asserts that\nit has suffered injury in the form of lost tax revenue\u2014its\n\u201cbusiness or property\u201d in RICO terms\u2014\u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s fraud.\n   Hemi does not contest the City\u2019s characterization of the\nJenkins Act violations as predicate offenses actionable\nunder \u00a71964(c). (We therefore assume, without deciding,\nthat failure to file Jenkins Act material can serve as a\nRICO predicate offense.) Instead, Hemi argues that the\nCity\u2019s asserted injury\u2014lost tax revenue\u2014is not \u201cbusiness\nor property\u201d under RICO, and that the City cannot show\nthat it suffered any injury \u201cby reason of\u201d the failure to file\nJenkins Act reports.\n   The District Court dismissed the City\u2019s RICO claims,\ndetermining that Hemi owner and officer Kai Gachupin\ndid not have an individual duty to file Jenkins Act reports,\nand thus could not have committed the alleged predicate\nacts. City of New York v. Nexicon, Inc., No. 03 CV 383\n(DAB), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">647716</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7\u2013*8 (SDNY, Mar. 15, 2006).\nThe District Court therefore held that the City could not\nestablish that Hemi and Gachupin formed an \u201centerprise\u201d\nas required to establish RICO liability. Id., at *7\u2013*10.\nBecause it dismissed on that ground, the District Court\ndid not address whether the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue\nconstitutes an injury to its \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under\n\u00a71964, or whether that injury was caused \u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports.\n   The Second Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s judg\u00ad\nment and remanded for further proceedings. The Court of\nAppeals held that the City had established that Gachupin\nand Hemi operated as an \u201centerprise\u201d and that the enter\u00ad\nprise committed the predicate RICO acts of mail and wire\nfraud, based on the failure to file the Jenkins Act material\nwith the State. 541 F. 3d, at 447\u2013448. The court also\ndetermined that the City\u2019s asserted injury, lost tax reve\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

And that injury, the court concluded, came about \u201cby\nreason of\u201d the predicate mail and wire frauds. Id., at 440\u2013\n444. The City thus had stated a viable RICO claim.\nJudge Winter dissented on the ground that the alleged\nRICO violation was not the proximate cause of the City\u2019s\ninjury. Id., at 458\u2013461.\n   Hemi filed a petition for certiorari, asking this Court to\ndetermine whether the City had been \u201cdirectly injured in\nits \u2018business or property\u2019 \u201d by reason of the alleged mail\nand wire frauds. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted that peti\u00ad\ntion. 556 U. S. __ (2009).\n                             II\n  Though framed as a single question, Hemi\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari raises two distinct issues: First, whether a loss\nin tax revenue is \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71964(c); and second, whether the City\u2019s asserted injury\ncame about \u201cby reason of\u201d the allegedly fraudulent con\u00ad\nduct, as required by \u00a71964(c). We determine that the City\ncannot satisfy the causation requirement\u2014that any injury\nthe City suffered must be \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged\nfrauds\u2014and therefore do not decide whether the City\u2019s\nallegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its\n\u201cbusiness or property.\u201d\n                             A\n   In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n503 U. S. 258 (1992), we set forth the standard of causa\u00ad\ntion that applies to civil RICO claims. In that case, we\naddressed a RICO claim brought by Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) against defendants whom\nSIPC alleged had manipulated stock prices. Id., at 262\u2013\n263. SIPC had a duty to reimburse customers of certain\nregistered broker-dealers in the event the broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their financial obligations. Id., at\n6         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n261. When the conspiracy by the stock manipulators was\ndetected, stock prices collapsed, and two broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their obligations to their customers.\nSIPC, as insurer against that loss, ultimately was on the\nhook for nearly $13 million to cover the customers\u2019 claims.\nThe Court held that SIPC could not recover against the\nconspirators because it could not establish that it was\ninjured \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged fraud, as that phrase is\nused in RICO.\n   We explained that, to state a claim under civil RICO,\nthe plaintiff is required to show that a RICO predicate\noffense \u201cnot only was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but\nwas the proximate cause as well.\u201d Id., at 268. Proximate\ncause for RICO purposes, we made clear, should be evalu\u00ad\nated in light of its common-law foundations; proximate\ncause thus requires \u201csome direct relation between the\ninjury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\nA link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindi\u00ad\nrec[t]\u201d is insufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n   Applying that standard, we rejected SIPC\u2019s RICO claim.\nThe alleged conspiracy, we held, directly harmed only the\nbroker-dealers; SIPC\u2019s injury, on the other hand, was\n\u201cpurely contingent\u201d on that harm. Id., at 271. The con\u00ad\nnection between the alleged conspiracy and SIPC\u2019s injury\nwas therefore \u201ctoo remote\u201d to satisfy RICO\u2019s direct rela\u00ad\ntionship requirement. Ibid.\n   The City\u2019s causal theory is far more attenuated than the\none we rejected in Holmes. According to the City, Hemi\ncommitted fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and\nfailing to submit the required customer information to the\nState. Without the reports from Hemi, the State could not\npass on the information to the City, even if it had been so\ninclined. Some of the customers legally obligated to pay\nthe cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\nCity did not receive the customer information, the City\ncould not determine which customers had failed to pay the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntax. The City thus could not pursue those customers for\npayment. The City thereby was injured in the amount of\nthe portion of back taxes that were never collected. See\nRecord A996.\n   But as we reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency\nof the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go be\u00ad\nyond the first step.\u201d 503 U. S., at 271\u2013272 (quoting Asso\nciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 534 (1983), in turn quoting Southern Pacific Co.\nv. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918),\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Our cases confirm\nthat the \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\nproximate cause inquiries under RICO. Holmes, supra, at\n271\u2013272; see also Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity\nCo., 553 U. S. __, __ (2008) (slip op., at 18\u201319); Anza v.\nIdeal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 460\u2013461 (2006).\nBecause the City\u2019s theory of causation requires us to move\nwell beyond the first step, that theory cannot meet RICO\u2019s\ndirect relationship requirement.\n   Our decision in Anza, supra, confirms that the City\u2019s\ntheory of causation is far too indirect. There we consid\u00ad\nered a RICO claim brought by Ideal Steel Supply against\nits competitor, National Steel Supply. Ideal alleged that\nNational had defrauded New York State by failing to\ncharge and remit sales taxes, and that National was thus\nable to undercut Ideal\u2019s prices. The lower prices offered by\nNational, Ideal contended, allowed National to attract\ncustomers at Ideal\u2019s expense. Id., at 458.\n   Finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury\nsuffered to be \u201cattenuated,\u201d we rejected Ideal\u2019s claim. Id.,\nat 459. \u201cThe direct victim of this conduct,\u201d we held, was\n\u201cthe State of New York, not Ideal.\u201d Id., at 458. \u201cIt was the\nState that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax\nrevenue as a result.\u201d Ibid. We recognized that Ideal had\nasserted \u201cits own harms when [National] failed to charge\ncustomers for the applicable sales tax.\u201d Ibid. But the\n8          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause of Ideal\u2019s harm was \u201ca set of actions (offering lower\nprices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation\n(defrauding the State).\u201d Ibid. The alleged violation there\u00ad\nfore had not \u201cled directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries,\u201d and\nIdeal accordingly had failed to meet RICO\u2019s \u201crequirement\nof a direct causal connection\u201d between the predicate of\u00ad\nfense and the alleged harm. Id., at 460\u2013461.\n   The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the\nclaim in Anza. Here, the conduct directly responsible for\nthe City\u2019s harm was the customers\u2019 failure to pay their\ntaxes. And the conduct constituting the alleged fraud was\nHemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports. Thus, as in\nAnza, the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct\nfrom the conduct giving rise to the fraud. See id., at 458.\n   Indeed, the disconnect between the asserted injury and\nthe alleged fraud in this case is even sharper than in\nAnza. There, we viewed the point as important because\nthe same party\u2014National Steel\u2014had both engaged in the\nharmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. We\nnevertheless found the distinction between the relevant\nacts sufficient to defeat Ideal\u2019s RICO claim. Here, the\nCity\u2019s theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,\nbut separate actions carried out by separate parties.\n   The City\u2019s theory thus requires that we extend RICO\nliability to situations where the defendant\u2019s fraud on the\nthird party (the State) has made it easier for a fourth\nparty (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the\nCity). Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused\nharm to the City in the first place if they decided not to\npay taxes they were legally obligated to pay. Put simply,\nHemi\u2019s obligation was to file the Jenkins Act reports with\nthe State, not the City, and the City\u2019s harm was directly\ncaused by the customers, not Hemi. We have never before\nstretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and\nwe decline to do so today. See id., at 460\u2013461; cf. Associ\nated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 541, n. 46 (finding no\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

The State certainly is\nbetter situated than the City to seek recovery from Hemi.\nAnd the State has an incentive to sue\u2014the State imposes\nits own $2.75 per pack tax on cigarettes possessed within\nthe State, nearly double what the City charges. N. Y. Tax\nLaw Ann. \u00a7471(1) (West Supp. 2009). We do not opine on\nwhether the State could bring a RICO action for any lost\ntax revenue. Suffice it to say that the State would have\nconcrete incentives to try. See Anza, supra, at 460 (\u201cIdeal\naccuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out\nof a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are\ntrue, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate\nremedies\u201d).\n   The dissent would have RICO\u2019s proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement turn on foreseeability, rather than on the exis\u00ad\ntence of a sufficiently \u201cdirect relationship\u201d between the\nfraud and the harm. It would find that the City has satis\u00ad\nfied that requirement because \u201cthe harm is foreseeable; it\nis a consequence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and\nit falls well within the set of risks that Congress sought to\nprevent.\u201d Post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). If this line of\nreasoning sounds familiar, it should. It is precisely the\nargument lodged against the majority opinion in Anza.\nThere, the dissent criticized the majority\u2019s view for \u201cper\u00ad\nmit[ting] a defendant to evade liability for harms that are\nnot only foreseeable, but the intended consequences of\nthe defendant\u2019s unlawful behavior.\u201d 547 U. S., at 470\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut the dissent there did not carry the day, and no one\nhas asked us to revisit Anza.\n10           HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are\nof course two of the \u201cmany shapes [proximate cause] took\nat common law,\u201d Holmes, supra, at 268. Our precedents\nmake clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the\ndirectness of the relationship between the conduct and the\nharm. Indeed, Anza and Holmes never even mention the\nconcept of foreseeability.\n                             B\n   The City offers a number of responses. It first chal\u00ad\nlenges our characterization of the violation at issue. In\nthe City\u2019s view, the violation is not merely Hemi\u2019s failure\nto file Jenkins Act information with the State, but a more\ngeneral \u201csystematic scheme to defraud the City of tax\nrevenue.\u201d Brief for Respondent 42. Having broadly de\u00ad\nfined the violation, the City contends that it has been\ndirectly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.\nIbid.\n   But the City cannot escape the proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme\nembraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged con\u00ad\nduct. Otherwise our RICO proximate cause precedent\nwould become a mere pleading rule. In Anza, for example,\nIdeal alleged that National\u2019s scheme \u201cwas to give National\na competitive advantage over Ideal.\u201d 547 U. S., at 454\u2013\n455. But that allegation did not prevent the Court from\nconcluding that National\u2019s fraud directly harmed only the\nState, not Ideal. As the Court explained, Ideal could not\n\u201ccircumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by\nclaiming that the defendant\u2019s aim was to increase market\nshare at a competitor\u2019s expense.\u201d Id., at 460.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even if we were willing to look to Hemi\u2019s intent, as the dissent sug\u00ad\n\ngests we should, the City would fare no better. Hemi\u2019s aim was not to\ndefraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to\nsell more cigarettes. Hemi itself neither owed taxes nor was obliged to\ncollect and remit them. This all suggests that Hemi\u2019s alleged fraud was\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our precedent makes clear, moreover, that \u201cthe com\u00ad\npensable injury flowing from a [RICO] violation . . . \u2018neces\u00ad\nsarily is the harm caused by [the] predicate acts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n457 (quoting Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.\n479, 497 (1985)). In its RICO statement, the City alleged\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports constituted\nthe predicate act of mail and wire fraud. Record A980.\nThe City went on to allege that this predicate act \u201cdirectly\ncaused\u201d its harm, id., at A996, but that assertion is a legal\nconclusion about proximate cause\u2014indeed, the very legal\nconclusion before us. The only fraudulent conduct alleged\nhere is a violation of the Jenkins Act. See 541 F. 3d, at\n459 (Winter, J., dissenting). Thus, the City must show\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the\nState led directly to its injuries. This it cannot do.\n   The City also relies on Bridge, 553 U. S. ___. Bridge\nreaffirmed the requirement that there must be \u201ca suffi\u00ad\nciently direct relationship between the defendant\u2019s wrong\u00ad\nful conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18). The case involved competing bidders at a county\ntax-lien auction. Because the liens were profitable even at\nthe lowest possible bid, multiple bidders offered that low\nbid. (The bidding took the form of the percentage tax\npenalty the bidder would require the property owner to\npay, so the lowest possible bid was 0%.) To decide which\nbidder would be awarded the lien, the county devised a\nplan to allocate the liens \u201con a rotational basis.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nas we noted in that case, this created a \u201cperverse incen\u00ad\ntive\u201d: \u201cBidders who, in addition to bidding themselves,\nsen[t] agents to bid on their behalf [would] obtain a dis\u00ad\nproportionate share of liens.\u201d Ibid. The county therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\naimed at Hemi\u2019s competitors, not the City. But Anza teaches that the\n\ncompetitors\u2019 injuries in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO\n\nclaim.\n\n12         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprohibited bidders from using such agents. Ibid.\n   A losing bidder alleged that a competitor had defrauded\nthe county by employing shadow bidders to secure a\ngreater proportion of liens than it was due. We held that\nthe bidder-plaintiff had met RICO\u2019s causation require\u00ad\nment. Distinguishing that claim from the one at issue in\nAnza, we noted that the plaintiff\u2019s theory of causation in\nBridge was \u201cstraightforward\u201d: Because of the zero-sum\nnature of the auction, and because the county awarded\nbids on a rotational basis, each time a fraud-induced bid\nwas awarded, a particular legitimate bidder was necessar\u00ad\nily passed over. 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The\nlosing bidders, moreover, \u201cwere the only parties injured by\npetitioners\u2019 misrepresentations.\u201d Ibid. The county was\nnot; it received the same revenue regardless of which\nbidder prevailed.\n   The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straight\u00ad\nforward: Multiple steps, as we have detailed, separate the\nalleged fraud from the asserted injury. And in contrast to\nBridge, where there were \u201cno independent factors that\naccount[ed] for [the plaintiff\u2019s] injury,\u201d ibid., here there\ncertainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the\nindependent actions of third and even fourth parties.\n   The City at various points during the proceedings below\ndescribed its injury as the lost \u201copportunity to tax\u201d rather\nthan \u201clost tax revenue.\u201d It is not clear that there is a\nsubstantive distinction between the two descriptions. In\nany event, before this Court, the City\u2019s argument turned\non lost revenue, not a lost opportunity to collect it. See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondent i (\u201cCounter-Question Pre\u00ad\nsented[:] Does the City of New York have standing under\nRICO because lost tax revenue constitutes a direct injury\nto the City\u2019s \u2018business or property\u2019 in accord with the\nstatute, 18 U.

Hemi\u2019s filing obliga\u00ad\ntion would still be to the State, and any harm to the City\nwould still be caused directly by the customers\u2019 failure to\npay their taxes. See 541 F. 3d, at 461 (Winter, J., dissent\u00ad\ning).

The dissent\u2019s answer looks largely to prosecution policy set\nforth in the Federal Department of Justice Guidelines, which are, of\ncourse, not only changeable, but have no applicability whatever to state\nor local governments. Under the decision below and the dissent\u2019s\nposition, RICO could be used as a tax collection device based solely on\nthe failure to file reports under the Jenkins Act, which itself provides\nquite limited remedies. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7377 (providing that a violation\nof the Jenkins Act may be punished as a misdemeanor with a fine up to\n$1,000 and imprisonment for no more than six months). And that\n14          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  In a final effort to save its claim, the City has shifted\ncourse before this Court. In its second amended complaint\nand RICO statement, the City relied solely on Hemi\u2019s\nfailure to file Jenkins Act reports with the State to form\nthe basis of the predicate act mail and wire frauds. See\nSecond Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b699, 101, 118, 125; Record\nA980\u2013A982. Before this Court, however, the City con\u00ad\ntends that Hemi made affirmative misrepresentations to\nCity residents, which, the City now argues, comprise part\nof the RICO predicate mail and wire frauds. See Brief for\nRespondent 42\u201343. The City\u2019s counsel pressed the point at\noral argument, asserting that the City\u2019s injury was\n\u201ccaused by the seller\u2019s misrepresentation, which encour\u00ad\nages the purchasers not to pay taxes.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\n  The City, however, affirmatively disavowed below any\nreliance on misrepresentations to form the predicate RICO\nviolation. The alleged false statements, the City there\nstated, \u201care evidence of the scheme to defraud, but are not\npart of the fraud itself. . . . [T]he scheme to defraud would\nexist even absent the statements.\u201d Record A980. The City\nreiterated the point: \u201cThe scheme consists of the interstate\nsale of cigarettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports\nindentifying those sales.\u201d Ibid. \u201cRelated to the fraud, but\nnot a circumstance \u2018constituting\u2019 the fraud, the defendants\ninform customers that [their] purchases will be concealed,\nand also seek to convince their customers that no taxes are\nowed by claiming, falsely, that the sales are tax-free.\u201d Id.,\nat A982. Not only did the City disclaim any reliance upon\nmisrepresentations to the customers to form the predicate\nacts under RICO, but the City made clear in its second\namended complaint that its two RICO claims rested solely\non the Jenkins Act violations as the predicate acts. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndevice would be available not only to the State, to which the reports\n\nwere due, but also to the City, to which Hemi owed no duty under the \n\nAct and to which it owed no taxes.\n\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Because the City\ndefined the predicate act before the District Court as\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports, and ex\u00ad\npressly disavowed reliance on the alleged misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions themselves as predicate acts, we decline to consider\nHemi\u2019s alleged misstatements as predicate acts at this late\nstage.\n                          *     *    *\n   It bears remembering what this case is about. It is\nabout the RICO liability of a company for lost taxes it had\nno obligation to collect, remit, or pay, which harmed a\nparty to whom it owed no duty. It is about imposing such\nliability to substitute for or complement a governing body\u2019s\nuncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from\nthose who owe them. And it is about the fact that the\nliability comes with treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees\nattached. This Court has interpreted RICO broadly,\nconsistent with its terms, but we have also held that its\nreach is limited by the \u201crequirement of a direct causal\nconnection\u201d between the predicate wrong and the harm.\nAnza, 547 U. S., at 460. The City\u2019s injuries here were not\ncaused directly by the alleged fraud, and thus were not\ncaused \u201cby reason of\u201d it. The City, therefore, has no RICO\nclaim.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

New York City (or\nCity) cannot, consistent with the Commerce Clause, com\npel Hemi Group, an out-of-state seller, to collect a City\nsales or use tax. See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504\nU. S. 298, 301 (1992); National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. De\npartment of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 758 (1967).\nUnable to impose its tax on Hemi Group, or to require\nHemi Group to collect its tax, New York City is attempting\nto use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Act (RICO),\n18 U. S. C. \u00a71964(c), in combination with the Jenkins Act,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378, to overcome that disability.\n   Hemi Group committed fraud only insofar as it violated\nthe Jenkins Act by failing to report the names and ad\ndresses of New York purchasers to New York State. There\nis no other grounding for the City\u2019s charge that it was\ndefrauded by Hemi Group. \u201cAbsent the Jenkins Act,\n[Hemi Group] would have owed no duty to disclose [its]\nsales to anyone, and [its] failure to disclose could not\nconceivably be deemed fraud of any kind.\u201d City of New\nYork v.

As\nthe majority points out, ante, at 3, the Racketeer Influ\u00ad\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71961\u20131968, provides a private cause of action (and\ntreble damages) to \u201c[a]ny person injured in\u201d that person\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness or property by reason of\u201d conduct that involves a\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71964(c) (emphasis\nadded), 1962. RICO defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to\ninclude violations of various predicate criminal statutes\nincluding mail and wire fraud. \u00a71961(1). The \u201cpattern of\nracketeering\u201d at issue here consists of repeated instances\nof mail fraud, which in turn consist largely of violations of\nthe federal Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378. That Act\n2          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nseeks to help States collect tobacco taxes by requiring out\u00ad\nof-state cigarette sellers, such as Hemi, to file reports with\nstate tobacco tax administrators identifying the names\nand addresses of in-state customers and the amounts they\npurchased. The violations consist of Hemi\u2019s intentional\nfailure to do so.\n  As the majority points out, we must assume for present\npurposes that an intentional failure to file Jenkins Act\nreports counts as mail fraud (at least where the failure is\npart of a scheme that includes use of the mails). Ante, at\n4. Lower courts have sometimes so held. See United\nStates v. Melvin, 544 F. 2d 767, 773\u2013777 (CA5 1977);\nUnited States v. Brewer, 528 F. 2d 492, 497\u2013498 (CA4\n1975). The Court of Appeals here so held. City of New\nYork v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 446 (CA2\n2008). And no one has challenged that holding.\n  We must also assume that Hemi\u2019s \u201cintentiona[l] con\u00ad\nceal[ment]\u201d of the name/address/purchase information,\nSecond Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6103, 104, is the legal equivalent of\nan affirmative representation that Hemi had no New York\nCity customers. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7551,\np. 119 (1976) (a person \u201cwho fails to disclose . . . a fact\u201d\nmay be \u201csubject to . . . liability\u201d as if \u201che had represented\nthe nonexistence of the matter that he has failed to dis\u00ad\nclose\u201d); cf. Stewart v. Wyoming Cattle Ranche Co., 128\nU. S. 383, 388 (1888) (concealment or suppression of mate\u00ad\nrial fact equivalent to a false representation). On these\nassumptions, the question before us is whether New York\nCity\u2019s loss of tax revenues constitutes an injury to its\n\u201cbusiness or property by reason of\u201d Hemi\u2019s Jenkins Act\nmisrepresentations.\n                            B\n  The case arises as a result of the District Court\u2019s dis\u00ad\nmissal of New York City\u2019s RICO complaint.

Bridge v.\nPhoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1\n(2008) (slip op., at 1, n. 1). Those facts (as I interpret\nthem) include the following:\n  1. New York State (or State) and New York City (or City)\n     both impose tobacco taxes on New York cigarette buy\u00ad\n     ers. Second Am. Compl. \u00b637.\n  2. Both City and State normally collect the taxes from\n     in-state cigarette sellers, who, in turn, charge retail\n     customers. Id., \u00b6\u00b64, 6.\n  3. Hemi, an out-of-state company, sells cigarettes over\n     the Internet to in-state buyers at prices that are lower\n     than in-state cigarette prices. The difference in price\n     is almost entirely attributable to the fact that Hemi\u2019s\n     prices do not include any charge for New York taxes.\n     Hemi advertises its cigarettes as \u201ctax free\u201d and often\n     adds that it \u201cdoes not report any sales activity to any\n     State taxing authority.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b62, 6, 108b (internal\n     quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).\n  4. New York State normally receives Jenkins Act reports\n     from out-of-state sellers. It is contractually obliged to\n     pass the information on to New York City (and I as\u00ad\n     sume it normally does so). Id., \u00b6\u00b68\u20139, 11, 54\u201357.\n  5. When it receives Jenkins-Act-type information, New\n     York City writes letters to resident customers asking\n     them to pay the tobacco tax they owe. As a result,\n     New York City collects about 40% of the tax due. (By\n     doing so, in 2005 the City obtained $400,000 out of $1\n     million owed.) Id., \u00b6\u00b658\u201359.\n  6. Hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file\n     Jenkins Act reports in order to prevent both State and\n     City from collecting the tobacco taxes that Hemi\u2019s in\u00ad\n     state customers owe and which otherwise many of\n     those customers would pay.

The\nfacts just set forth make clear that we must answer that\nquestion affirmatively. For one thing, no one denies that\nHemi\u2019s misrepresentation was a \u201cbut-for\u201d condition of New\nYork City\u2019s loss. In the absence of the misrepresentation,\ni.e., had Hemi told New York State the truth about its\nNew York City customers, New York City would have\nwritten letters to the purchasers and obtained a signifi\u00ad\ncant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.\n   For another thing, New York City\u2019s losses are \u201creasona\u00ad\nbly foreseeable\u201d results of the misrepresentation. It is\nforeseeable that, without the name/address/purchase\ninformation, New York City would not be able to write\nsuccessful dunning letters, and it is foreseeable that, with\nthat information, it would be able to write successful\ndunning letters. Indeed, that is a natural inference from,\namong other things, the complaint\u2019s assertion that Hemi\nadvertised that it did not \u201creport\u201d sales information to\n\u201cState taxing authorit[ies].\u201d See, e.g., Smith v. Bolles, 132\nU. S. 125, 130 (1889) (for causation purposes, \u201c \u2018those\nresults are proximate which the wrong-doer from his\nposition must have contemplated as the probable conse\u00ad\nquence of his fraud or breach of contract\u2019 \u201d (quoting Crater\nv.

E. 904, 905 (1923)\n(third party\u2019s forgery of a bill of lading an intervening\ncause); Prosser and Keeton \u00a744, at 313\u2013314 (collecting\ncases on intervening intentional or criminal acts). But an\nintervening third-party act, even if criminal, does not cut a\ncausal chain where the intervening act is foreseeable and\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct increases the risk of its occur\u00ad\nrence. See Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, 462 (1947)\n(per curiam); Horan v. Watertown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186, 104\nN.

Hemi\u2019s act here did increase the\nrisk that New York City would not be paid; and not only\nwas the risk foreseeable, but Hemi\u2019s advertising strongly\nsuggests that Hemi actually knew nonreporting would\nlikely bring about this very harm.\n   The majority claims that \u201cdirectness,\u201d rather than fore\u00ad\nseeability, should be our guide in assessing proximate\ncause, and that the lack of a \u201cdirect\u201d relationship in this\ncase precludes a finding of proximate causation. Ante, at\n9\u201310. But courts used this concept of directness in tort\nlaw to expand liability (for direct consequences) beyond\nwhat was foreseeable, not to eliminate liability for what\nwas foreseeable. Thus, under the \u201cdirectness\u201d theory of\nproximate causation, there is liability for both \u201call \u2018direct\u2019\n8         HEMI GROUP, LLC v.

S. 451\n(2006), to invoke anything other than this traditional\nunderstanding.\n   Second, the majority correctly points out that Hemi\nmisrepresented the situation to the State, not to the\nCity\u2014a circumstance which, the majority believes, signifi\u00ad\ncantly separates misrepresentation from harm. Ante, at 8.\nBut how could that be so? New York State signed a con\u00ad\ntract promising to relay relevant information to the City.\nIn respect to that relevant information, the State is a\nconduit, indeed roughly analogous to a postal employee.\nThis Court has recognized specifically that \u201cunder the\ncommon law a fraud may be established when the defen\u00ad\ndant has made use of a third party to reach the target of\nthe fraud.\u201d Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 129\n(1987). The treatises say the same. See, e.g., Prosser and\nKeeton \u00a7107, at 743\u2013745; 26 C. J. S., Fraud \u00a747, p. 1121\n(1921) (collecting cases); see also Prosser, Misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion and Third Parties, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240\u2013241,\nand nn. 56\u201359, 62\u201364 (1966) (collecting cases). This Court\nhas never suggested the contrary, namely, that a defen\u00ad\ndant is not liable for (foreseeable) harm (intentionally)\ncaused to the target of a scheme to defraud simply because\nthe misrepresentation was transmitted via a third (or even\na fourth or fifth) party. Cf. Terry, Intent to Defraud, 25\nYale L. J. 87, 93 (1915) (\u201cWhen a representation is com\u00ad\nmunicated through one person to another in such circum\u00ad\nstances that it can be deemed to be directed to the latter,\nit makes no difference through how many persons or by\nhow circuitous a route it reaches the latter . . .\u201d).\n   Third, the majority places great weight upon its view\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Third\nAmended RICO Statement \u00b6d (explaining that \u201c[e]very\nother State or local government that imposes a use tax on\ncigarettes and whose residents purchase cigarettes\u201d from\nHemi is a victim of its scheme to defraud). Hemi sought to\nprevent the State from collecting state taxes; and it sought\nto prevent the City from collecting city taxes. Here we are\nconcerned only with the latter. In respect to the latter, the\nState was an information conduit. The fact that state\ntaxes were also involved is beside the point.\n   The two Supreme Court cases to which the majority\nrefers involve significantly different causal circumstances.\nAnte, at 5\u20138. The predicate acts in Holmes\u2014the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s acts that led to the plaintiff\u2019s harm\u2014consisted of\nsecurities frauds. The defendant misrepresented the\nprospects of one company and misled the investing public\ninto falsely believing that it could readily buy and sell the\nstock of another. When the truth came out, stock prices\nfell, investors (specifically, stockbrokers) lost money, and\nsince the stockbrokers could not pay certain creditors,\nthose creditors also lost money. 503 U. S., at 262\u2013263.\nClaiming subrogation to stand in the shoes of the credi\u00ad\ntors, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation sued.\nId., at 270\u2013271.\n   Since the creditors had not bought the securities, there\nwas little reason to believe the defendant intended their\nharm. And the securities statutes seek, first and foremost,\nto protect investors, not creditors of those who sell stock to\nthose investors. The latter harm (a broker\u2019s creditor\u2019s\nloss) differs in kind from the harm that the \u201cpredicate act\u201d\nstatute primarily seeks to avoid and that its violation\nwould ordinarily cause (namely, investors\u2019 stock-related\nmonetary losses). As Part II\u2013A, supra, points out, neither\nof these circumstances is present here.\n   In Anza, the plaintiff was a business competitor of the\n10         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndefendants. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants\nfalsely told state officials that they did not owe sales tax.\nThe plaintiff added that, had the defendants paid the tax\nthey owed, the defendants would have had less money\navailable to run their business, and the plaintiff conse\u00ad\nquently would have been able to compete against them\nmore effectively. 547 U. S., at 454, 457\u2013458.\n   Again, in Anza the kind of harm that the plaintiff al\u00ad\nleged is not the kind of harm that the tax statutes primar\u00ad\nily seek to prevent. Rather, it alleged a kind of harm\n(competitive injury) that tax violations do not ordinarily\ncause and which ordinarily flows from the regular opera\u00ad\ntion of a competitive marketplace. Thus, in both Holmes\nand Anza, unlike the present case, plaintiffs alleged spe\u00ad\ncial harm, neither squarely within the class of harms at\nwhich the relevant statutes were directed, nor of a kind\nthat typical violators would intend or even foresee.\n   Bridge, which the majority seeks to distinguish, ante, at\n11\u201312, is a more closely analogous case. The defendants\nin that case directed agents to misrepresent to a county\nthat they qualified as independent bidders at a county-run\nproperty auction. They consequently participated in the\nauction. And the plaintiffs, facing additional bidders, lost\nsome of the property that they otherwise would have\nwon\u2014all to their financial disadvantage. 553 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134). The harm was foreseeable; it\nwas intended; and it was precisely the kind of harm that\nthe county\u2019s bidding rules sought to prevent. Thus this\nCourt held that the harm was \u201ca foreseeable and natural\nconsequence of [the defendants\u2019] scheme.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   In sum, the majority recognizes that \u201c[p]roximate cause\nfor RICO purposes . . . should be evaluated in light of its\ncommon law foundations,\u201d ante, at 6, but those founda\u00ad\ntions do not support the majority\u2019s view. Moreover, the\nmajority\u2019s rationale would free from RICO liability defen\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Salmonese, 352 F. 3d 608, 612 (CA2\n2003). They deliberately and repeatedly make egregiously\nfraudulent misrepresentations to inflate the price of secu\u00ad\nrities that, unbeknownst to investors, they own. After the\nstock price rises, the defendants sell at an artificial profit.\nWhen the fraud is revealed, the price crashes, to the inves\u00ad\ntors\u2019 detriment. Suppose the defendants have intention\u00ad\nally spoken directly only to intermediaries who simply\nrepeated the information to potential investors, and have\nnot had any contact with the investors themselves. Under\nthe majority\u2019s reasoning, these defendants apparently did\nnot proximately cause the investors\u2019 losses and are not\nliable under RICO.\n                             III\n   If there is causation, we must decide whether, for RICO\npurposes, the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue is \u201c \u2018business or\nproperty\u2019 under 18 U. S. C. \u00a71964(c).\u201d Ante, at 5 (acknowl\u00ad\nedging, but not reaching, this second issue). The question\nhas led to concern among the lower courts. Some fear that\nan affirmative answer would turn RICO into a tax collec\u00ad\ntion statute, permitting States to bring RICO actions and\nrecover treble damages for behavior that amounts to no\nmore than a failure to pay taxes due.

The Department\u2019s prosecution\nguidelines require prosecutors considering a tax-related\nmail fraud or wire fraud or bank fraud prosecution (or a\nrelated RICO prosecution) to obtain approval from high\u00ad\nlevel Department officials. And those guidelines specify\nthat the Department will grant that approval only where\nthere is at issue \u201ca large fraud loss or a substantial\npattern of conduct\u201d and will not do so, absent \u201cunusual\ncircumstances,\u201d in cases involving simply \u201cone person\u2019s\ntax liability.\u201d Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019\nManual \u00a76\u20134.210(A) (2007), online at http://www.justice.\ngov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title6/4mtax.htm\n(as visited Jan. 20, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file); see also \u00a76\u20134.210(B) (explaining that the De\u00ad\npartment \u201cwill not authorize the use of mail, wire or bank\nfraud charges to convert routine tax prosecutions into\nRICO . . . cases\u201d).\n   This case involves an extensive pattern of fraudulent\nconduct, large revenue losses, and many different unre\u00ad\nlated potential taxpayers. The Department\u2019s guidelines\nwould appear to authorize prosecution in these circum\u00ad\nstances.

S. 349 (2005), a case that we decided\nonly five years ago.

Id., at 355.\n   Hemi points in reply to our decision in Hawaii v. Stan\ndard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U. S. 251 (1972). But that case\ninvolved not a loss of tax revenues, but \u201cinjury to the\ngeneral economy of a State\u201d\u2014insofar as it was threatened\nby violations of antitrust law. Id., at 260. Hawaii\u2019s inter\u00ad\nest, both more general and derivative of harm to individ\u00ad\nual businesses, differs significantly from the particular tax\nloss at issue in Pasquantino and directly at issue here.\n   We have previously made clear that the compensable\ninjury for RICO purposes is the harm caused by the predi\u00ad\ncate acts. See generally Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,\n473 U. S. 479, 495\u2013496 (1985); cf. Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000). I can find no convincing\nreason in the context of this case to distinguish in the\ncircumstances present here between \u201cproperty\u201d as used in\nthe mail fraud statute and \u201cproperty\u201d as used in RICO.\nHence, I would postpone for another day the question\nwhether RICO covers instances where little more than the\nliability of an individual taxpayer is at issue. And I would\nfind in the respondent\u2019s favor here.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
