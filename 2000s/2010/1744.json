HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 08\u2013911.      Argued November 10, 2009\u2014Decided January 20, 2010\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n  1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or\n  Act), codifying certain rules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney Gen\n  eral, that govern the process of reopening removal proceedings.\n  IIRIRA also added a provision stating that no court has jurisdiction\n  to review any action of the Attorney General \u201cthe authority for which\n  is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor\n  ney General.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii). A regulation, amended\n  just months before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment, provides that \u201c[t]he decision\n  to grant or deny a motion to reopen . . . is within the discretion of the\n  [Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)],\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a). As adjudi\n  cator in immigration cases, the BIA exercises authority delegated by\n  the Attorney General.\n     Petitioner Kucana moved to reopen his removal proceedings, as\n  serting new evidence in support of his plea for asylum. An Immigra\n  tion Judge denied the motion, and the BIA sustained that ruling.\n  The Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review\n  the administrative determination, holding that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars\n  judicial review not only of administrative decisions made discretion\n  ary by statute, but also of those made discretionary by regulation.\nHeld: Section 1252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s proscription of judicial review applies only\n to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute,\n not to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General\n himself through regulation. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) The motion to reopen is an \u201cimportant safeguard\u201d intended \u201cto\n ensure a proper and lawful disposition\u201d of immigration proceedings.\n Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___. Federal-court review of adminis\n trative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings\n2                          KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential\n    abuse-of-discretion standard of review. While the Attorney General\u2019s\n    regulation in point, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), places the reopening decision\n    within the BIA\u2019s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescrip\n    tion or otherwise \u201cspecif[y]\u201d that such decisions are in the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretion. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of deni\n    als of motions to reopen. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (1) The amicus defending the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment urges\n    that regulations suffice to trigger \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proscription.\n    She comprehends \u201cunder\u201d in \u201cauthority . . . specified under this sub\n    chapter\u201d to mean, e.g., \u201cpursuant to,\u201d \u201csubordinate to.\u201d Administra\n    tive regulations count for \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, be\n    cause they are issued \u201cpursuant to,\u201d and are measures \u201csubordinate\n    to,\u201d the legislation they serve to implement. On that reading,\n    \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an\n    executive regulation places within the BIA\u2019s discretion, including the\n    decision to deny a motion to reopen. The parties, on the other hand,\n    read the statutory language to mean \u201cspecified in,\u201d or \u201cspecified by,\u201d\n    the subchapter. On their reading, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judi\n    cial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary\n    character of the Attorney General\u2019s authority. Pp. 8\u20139.\n         (2) The word \u201cunder\u201d \u201chas many dictionary definitions and must\n    draw its meaning from its context.\u201d Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129,\n    135. Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the par\n    ties\u2019 position stands on firmer ground. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far\n    from IIRIRA\u2019s only jurisdictional limitation. It is sandwiched be\n    tween two subsections, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C), both de\n    pendent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define\n    their scope. Given \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, one would\n    expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone. Pp. 9\u201311.\n         (3) Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review\n    category \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n    1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the referenced\n    statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief\n    from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is\n    entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. Clause (i) does not re\n    fer to any regulatory provision. The proximity of clause (i) and the\n    clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other deci\n    sion\u201d\u2014suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\n    genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Read harmoni\n    ously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of dis\n    cretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute. Pp. 11\u201312.\n                   Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (4) Also significant is the character of the decisions insulated\nfrom judicial review in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i). The listed determinations\nare substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or\nnot aliens can stay in the country. Other decisions specified by stat\nute \u201cto be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d and therefore\nshielded from court oversight by \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71157(c)(1). Decisions on reopening motions made discre\ntionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings. A court deci\nsion reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the\nExecutive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches\nand concerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have been\naccorded a reasonable hearing. Had Congress wanted the jurisdic\ntional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regu\nlation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have\nsaid so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See, e.g., IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013572.\nPp. 12\u201314.\n      (5) The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates\nthis determination. Attorney General regulations have long ad\ndressed reopening requests. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simulta\nneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to\nbar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding re\nmoval. But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions. This legislative\nsilence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was pre-\nIIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney\nGeneral, \u201cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), but\ncourts retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. It is unsur\nprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this\n\u201cimportant [procedural] safeguard,\u201d Dada, 554 U. S., at ___, where,\nas here, the alien\u2019s underlying asylum claim would itself be review\nable. The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by\nadding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from re\nmoval, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of\ndecisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions\nto reopen. Pp. 14\u201316.\n   (c) Any lingering doubt about \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proper interpreta\ntion would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle:\nthe presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.\nWhen a statute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion,\u201d this Court adopts the reading \u201cthat executive determinations\ngenerally are subject to judicial review.\u201d Gutierrez de Martinez v.\nLamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434. The Court has consistently applied\nthis interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and par\n4                          KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ticularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court ju\n    risdiction. See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.\n    43, 63\u201364. Because this presumption is \u201c \u2018well-settled,\u2019 \u201d ibid., the\n    Court assumes that \u201cCongress legislates with knowledge of\u201d it,\n    McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496. It there\n    fore takes \u201c \u2018 \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d \u2019 \u201d to dislodge the pre\n    sumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64. There is no\n    such evidence here. Finally, reading \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to\n    matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would\n    ignore Congress\u2019 design to retain for itself control over federal-court\n    jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s construction would free the Ex\n    ecutive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate\n    court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions\n    \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\n    not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

ERIC H. HOLDER,\n          JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                               [January 20, 2010]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Agron Kucana moved to reopen his removal\nproceedings, asserting new evidence in support of his plea\nfor asylum. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) sus\ntained the IJ\u2019s ruling, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\nreview the administrative determination. For that conclu\nsion, the court relied on a provision added to the Immigra\ntion and Nationality Act (INA or Act), 66 Stat. 166, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., by the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110\nStat. 3009\u2013546. The provision found dispositive by the\nSeventh Circuit, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), states that no\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the\nAttorney General \u201cthe authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor\nney General,\u201d \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription\nof judicial review stated in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) applies not only\nto Attorney General determinations made discretionary by\n2                   KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, but also to determinations declared discretionary\nby the Attorney General himself through regulation. We\nhold that the key words \u201cspecified under this subchapter\u201d\nrefer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We\nso rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial\nreview of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the\ntext and context of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), and the history of the\nrelevant statutory provisions. We take account, as well, of\nthe \u201cpresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to]\nallow judicial review of administrative action.\u201d Reno v.\nCatholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 63\u201364 (1993)\n(quoting McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.\n479, 496 (1991)). Separation-of-powers concerns, more\nover, caution us against reading legislation, absent clear\nstatement, to place in executive hands authority to remove\ncases from the Judiciary\u2019s domain.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n  In IIRIRA, Congress for the first time codified certain\nrules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney General, govern\ning the reopening process. The amended Act instructs\nthat reopening motions \u201cshall state the new facts that will\nbe proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,\nand shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary\nmaterial.\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B). Congress also prescribed that\n\u201cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the\ndate of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d\n\u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Among matters excepted from the 90\nday limitation are motions to reopen asylum applications\nbecause of changed conditions in the country of nationality\nor removal. \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).\n  Section 1252(a)(2), captioned \u201cMatters not subject to\njudicial review,\u201d contains the provision on which this case\nturns.

Kucana v. Mukasey,\n533 F. 3d 534, 539 (2008). The court held that 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars judicial review not only of adminis\ntrative decisions made discretionary by statute, but also\n\u201cwhen the agency\u2019s discretion is specified by a regulation\nrather than a statute.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536.6 In so ruling,\nthe Seventh Circuit created a split between itself and\nother Courts of Appeals, all of them holding that denials of\nreopening motions are reviewable in court.7\n  Judge Ripple concurred dubitante. He acknowledged\nthat the court was following an earlier decision, Ali v.\nGonzales, 502 F. 3d 659 (CA7 2007),8 but \u201csuggest[ed]\nthat, had Congress intended to deprive th[e] court of juris\ndiction . . . , it would have done so explicitly, as it did in 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i).\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 540. The court,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 While recognizing that a regulation, rather than the INA itself,\n\nconfers on the Board discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen, the\nCourt of Appeals said that the regulation, \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] . . . force\nfrom provisions in the Act allowing immigration officials to govern their\nown proceedings.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536. The \u201cforce,\u201d according to the\nSeventh Circuit, comes from 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), which it described\nas providing \u201cauthority for reopening by [the] Board.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at\n536. Section 1229a(c)(7), however, is not directed to the agency\u2019s\ndiscretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. In the main, \u201cit simply\nlays out the requirements an alien must fulfill when filing a motion to\nreopen.\u201d Id., at 541 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).

Given the absence of \u201cspecific\n[statutory] language entrusting the decision on a motion\nto reopen to the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted), he saw no impediment\nto the exercise of jurisdiction over Kucana\u2019s petition. In\nsupport of his position, Judge Cudahy invoked the \u201cstrong\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review of\nadministrative action.\u201d Id., at 541 (quoting Traynor v.\nTurnage, 485 U. S. 535, 542 (1988)). With four judges\ndissenting, the Seventh Circuit denied Kucana\u2019s petition\nfor rehearing en banc. See 533 F. 3d, at 541\u2013542 (dissent\ning statement of Ripple, J., joined by Rovner, Wood, and\nWilliams, JJ.).\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to re-\nsolve the Circuit conflict. As it did before the Seventh\nCircuit, the Government agrees with Kucana that\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not remove federal-court jurisdic\ntion to review the denial of a reopening motion.

Mindful of the Board\u2019s\n\u201cbroad discretion\u201d in such matters, however, courts have\nemployed a deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of\nreview. See Doherty, 502 U. S., at 323 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n    The Seventh Circuit held that Congress removed the\nauthority long exercised by federal courts to review deni\nals of an alien\u2019s reopening request. Congress did so, the\nCourt of Appeals said, in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which removes\njurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General\n\u201cthe authority for which is specified under this subchapter\nto be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d All agree\nthat the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a),\nplaces \u201c[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen\n. . . within the discretion of the Board.\u201d But the statute\ndoes not codify that prescription,9 and does not otherwise\n\u201cspecif[y]\u201d that reopening decisions are \u201cin the discretion\nof the Attorney General.\u201d10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 As earlier noted, see supra, at 5, n. 6, the Seventh Circuit stated\n\nthat the regulation specifying the Board\u2019s discretion over motions to\nreopen, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] [its] force from provisions in the\nAct.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536 (citing 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7)). It is hard to see\nhow the regulation could draw force from \u00a71229a(c)(7), for the regula\ntion was already in force when that statutory provision was enacted.\nThe regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), was published April 29, 1996, 61\nFed. Reg. 18900, 18904; 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7) was enacted September\n30, 1996, \u00a7304, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013593.\n   10 The only statutory reference to discretion respecting motions to\n\nreopen appears in \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III), which gives the Attorney\nGeneral \u201cdiscretion\u201d to waive one of the statute\u2019s time limitations in\n8                         KUCANA v.

The Board has discretion\nto deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a).\nNevertheless, in defense of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judg\nment, amicus urges that regulations suffice to trigger 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proscription of judicial review.\n  The jurisdiction-stripping provision, amicus reminds,\nrefers to \u201cauthority . . . specified under this subchapter.\u201d\nAs she reads that formulation, the word \u201cunder\u201d is key.\nShe comprehends \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cpursuant to,\u201d \u201csubor\ndinate to,\u201d \u201cbelow or lower than,\u201d \u201cinferior . . . in rank or\nimportance,\u201d \u201cby reason of the authority of.\u201d Brief for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nextraordinary circumstances.\n   Amicus urges that \u201cthe statutory language governing motions to\nreopen anticipates an exercise of Attorney General discretion when it\nstates, \u2018[t]he motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be\nproven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nCourt-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 19, n. 8\n(quoting \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B)). One can demur to the argument that Con\ngress anticipated that decisions on reopening motions would be discre\ntionary.     Even so, the statutory proscription Congress enacted,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), speaks of authority \u201cspecified\u201d\u2014not merely assumed\nor contemplated\u2014to be in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. \u201cSpeci\nfied\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cimplied\u201d or \u201canticipated.\u201d See Webster\u2019s\nNew Collegiate Dictionary 1116 (1974) (\u201cspecify\u201d means \u201cto name or\nstate explicitly or in detail\u201d).

On the parties\u2019\nreading, however, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial\nreview only when the statute itself specifies the discre\ntionary character of the Attorney General\u2019s authority.\n                             2\n  As the parties and amicus recognize, their diverse ren\nderings of \u201cunder,\u201d standing alone, do not equip us to\nresolve this case.

See App. A to Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nSupport of Judgment Below. In every one of those examples, Congress\nexpressly used the word \u201cregulations.\u201d\n  At oral argument, amicus called our attention to three instances in\nwhich Congress used the words \u201cspecified under\u201d in Title 8, without any\nreference to \u201cregulations,\u201d to encompass agency matters.

HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning, in statutory context, the provision in which the word\n\u201cunder\u201d is embedded, we conclude that the parties\u2019 posi\ntion stands on firmer ground.\n   Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), the provision at issue here, is\nfar from the only jurisdictional limitation in IIRIRA. See\nDada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Davis v.

Section\n1252(a)(2), titled \u201cMatters not subject to judicial review,\u201d\nlists a variety of agency determinations the federal courts\nlack jurisdiction to review. Those determinations divide\ninto three categories. The first, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A), concerns\nimmigration officers\u2019 determinations whether aliens apply\ning for admission are admissible. Next in statutory order\nis the provision before us, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), which involves\ndenials of discretionary relief.        The last category,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(C), concerns final orders of removal entered\nagainst criminal aliens.\n   Both \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C) depend on statu\ntory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their\nscope. The latter provision, the criminal alien bar, pre\ncludes judicial review of \u201cany final order of removal\nagainst an alien who is removable by reason of having\ncommitted a criminal offense covered in\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2),\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or certain offenses\ncovered in \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(ii).

Given\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, sandwiched between\nsubsections (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(C), one would expect that\nit, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.\n                              3\n   Focusing on \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), we note the lead line serving\nto introduce both of the subparagraph\u2019s two clauses: \u201c[N]o\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review . . . .\u201d Clause (i)\nthen places within the no-judicial-review category \u201cany\njudgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the\nstatutory provisions referenced in clause (i) addresses a\ndifferent form of discretionary relief from removal, see\nsupra, at 3, n. 2, and each contains language indicating\nthat the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s\ndiscretion. See, e.g., \u00a71182(h) (\u201cThe Attorney General\nmay, in his discretion, waive [inadmissibility based on\ncertain criminal offenses].\u201d). Clause (i) does not refer to\nany regulatory provision.\n   To the clause (i) enumeration of administrative judg\nments that are insulated from judicial review, Congress\nadded in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering \u201cany\nother decision . . . the authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter.\u201d The proximity of clauses (i) and\n(ii), and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other decision\u201d\u2014\nsuggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\ngenre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation.13 The\nclause (i) enumeration, we find, is instructive in determin\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    13 Congress excepted from \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \u201cthe granting of relief\n\nunder [\u00a7]1158(a).\u201d Section 1158 concerns applications for asylum.\nAbsent the exception, asylum applicants might fall within\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar because a statutory provision,\n\u00a71158(b)(1)(A), specifies that \u201cthe Attorney General may grant asylum.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)

S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoval, \u00a71229b; permission for voluntary departure,\n\u00a71229c; and adjustment of status, \u00a71255.\n   Other decisions specified by statute \u201cto be in the discre\ntion of the Attorney General,\u201d and therefore shielded from\ncourt oversight by \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71157(c)(1) (discretion to admit refugees \u201cdeter\nmined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United\nStates\u201d); \u00a71181(b) (discretion to waive requirement of\ndocumentation for readmission); \u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(iv) (discre\ntion to waive, in certain cases, inadmissibility of aliens\nwho have affiliated with a totalitarian party). Decisions\non reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in\ncontrast, are adjunct rulings: The motion to reopen is a\nprocedural device serving to ensure \u201cthat aliens [a]re\ngetting a fair chance to have their claims heard.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17. A court decision reversing the denial of a\nmotion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford\nthe alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and\nconcerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have\nbeen accorded a reasonable hearing.\n   If Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass\ndecisions specified as discretionary by regulation along\nwith those made discretionary by statute, moreover, Con\ngress could easily have said so. In other provisions en\nacted simultaneously with \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress\nexpressed precisely that meaning. See IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110\nStat. 3009\u2013572 (\u201cimmigration benefits pursuant to this\nAct; or the regulations promulgated thereunder\u201d), codified\nat 8 U. S.

S. C. \u00a71103(a)(10). \u201c[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d Nken v. Holder,\n14                   KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n                              B\n   The history of the relevant statutory provisions corrobo\nrates our determination that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not\nproscribe judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.\nAttorney General regulations have long addressed reopen\ning requests. See 6 Fed. Reg. 71\u201372 (1941). The current\nregulations, adopted in 1996, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904\u201318906,\nderive from rules published in 1958, see 23 Fed. Reg.\n9118\u20139119; Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   Enacting IIRIRA in 1996, Congress \u201ctransform[ed] the\nmotion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statu\ntory form of relief available to the alien.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). IIRIRA largely codified the Attorney General\u2019s\ndirections on filing reopening motions. See \u00a71229a(c)(7)\n(guaranteeing right to file one motion, prescribing con\ntents, and setting deadlines).\n   In the same legislation, Congress amended the INA\naggressively to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal\nbasis to remain in the United States. See Reno v. Ameri\ncan-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475\n(1999). Among IIRIRA\u2019s several proscriptions of judicial\nreview is the one here at issue, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barring\nreview of administrative decisions Congress placed within\nthe Attorney General\u2019s discretion.\n   Congress thus simultaneously codified the process for\nfiling motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of\na number of executive decisions regarding removal. But\nCongress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. See 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (reopening may be entertained not only on\napplication; Board \u201cmay at any time reopen . . . on its own\nmotion any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d).\nHad Congress elected to insulate denials of motions to\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreopen from judicial review, it could have so specified\ntogether with its codification of directions on filing reopen\ning motions.\n  From the Legislature\u2019s silence on the discretion of the\nAttorney General (or his delegate, the Board) over reopen\ning motions, see supra, at 7\u20138, n. 10, we take it that Con\ngress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA\nhas broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General,\n\u201cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a),\nbut courts retain jurisdiction to review, with due respect,\nthe Board\u2019s decision.16 It is unsurprising that Congress\nwould leave in place judicial oversight of this \u201cimportant\n[procedural] safeguard\u201d designed \u201cto ensure a proper and\nlawful disposition\u201d of immigration proceedings, Dada, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316), where, as here, the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim (for asylum) would itself be reviewable.17\n  In the REAL ID Act, Congress further amended the\nINA. By 2005, two Courts of Appeals had already ruled\nthat 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude them\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 A statement in the House Conference Report on IIRIRA, amicus\n\nsuggests, supports her argument that Congress intended broadly to\nforeclose judicial review of reopening denials.        Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 32\u201334. The\nreport states that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) \u201cbars judicial review . . . of any deci\nsion or action of the Attorney General which is specified to be in the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General.\u201d H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\u2013828,\np. 219 (1996). That statement, as we read it, simply summarizes the\nstatutory text at a general level. It does not home in on the question\nwhether decisions made discretionary only by regulation are judicially\nreviewable.\n   17 We do not reach the question whether review of a reopening denial\n\nwould be precluded if the court would lack jurisdiction over the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim for relief. Some courts confronting that question have\nrefused to consider petitions for review of a reopening denial that seeks\nto revisit the denial of the underlying claim; they have reasoned that\nhearing the petition would end-run the bar to review of the petitioner\u2019s\ncore claim. See, e.g., Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F. 3d 471, 473\u2013475 (CA5\n2004) (per curiam).\n16                     KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom reviewing denials of motions to reopen, see Infanzon\nv. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1359, 1361\u20131362 (CA10 2004); Me\ndina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 520, 528\u2013529 (CA9\n2004), and no court had reached a contrary result. Al\nthough adding or reformulating provisions on asylum,\n\u00a7101(a), (b), 119 Stat. 302\u2013303, protection from removal,\n\u00a7101(c), (d), id., at 303\u2013305, even judicial review, \u00a7106, id.,\nat 310\u2013311, the REAL ID Act did not disturb the unbroken\nline of decisions upholding court review of administrative\ndenials of motions to reopen. See supra, at 6\u20137; supra, at\n3, n. 1.18\n                              IV\n   Any lingering doubt about the proper interpretation of 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be dispelled by a familiar\nprinciple of statutory construction: the presumption favor\ning judicial review of administrative action. When a\nstatute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion, we adopt the reading that accords with traditional\nunderstandings and basic principles: that executive de\nterminations generally are subject to judicial review.\u201d\nGutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434\n(1995). We have consistently applied that interpretive\nguide to legislation regarding immigration, and particu\nlarly to questions concerning the preservation of federal\ncourt jurisdiction. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,\n298 (2001); Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 63\u2013\n64; McNary, 498 U. S., at 496.

Courts\nof Appeals have held that such decisions are unreviewable because\nsua sponte reopening is committed to agency discretion by law, see 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7701(a)(2). See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey, 521 F. 3d 1000,\n1003\u20131004 (CA8 2008) (en banc) (per curiam) (agreeing with ten other\nCourts of Appeals).\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview of administrative action\u201d is \u201cwell-settled,\u201d Catholic\nSocial Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 63\u201364 (quoting McNary,\n498 U. S., at 496), the Court assumes that \u201cCongress\nlegislates with knowledge of\u201d the presumption, id., at 496.\nIt therefore takes \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to dis\nlodge the presumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509\nU. S., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is\nno such evidence here.\n  Finally, we stress a paramount factor in the decision we\nrender today. By defining the various jurisdictional bars\nby reference to other provisions in the INA itself, Congress\nensured that it, and only it, would limit the federal courts\u2019\njurisdiction. To read \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters\nwhere discretion is conferred on the Board by regulation,\nrather than on the Attorney General by statute, would\nignore that congressional design. If the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Ex\necutive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions\nfrom abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by\nissuing a regulation declaring those decisions \u201cdiscretion\nary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\nnot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.\n                               V\n  A statute affecting federal jurisdiction \u201cmust be con\nstrued both with precision and with fidelity to the terms\nby which Congress has expressed its wishes.\u201d Cheng Fan\nKwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968). As we have noted,\nsee supra, at 14, and as amicus emphasizes, \u201cmany provi\nsions of IIRIRA [we]re aimed at protecting [from court\nreview exercises of] the Executive\u2019s discretion.\u201d American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 486 (em\nphasis deleted). But \u201cno law pursues its purpose at all\ncosts, and . . . the textual limitations upon a law\u2019s scope\nare no less a part of its \u2018purpose\u2019 than its substantive\nauthorizations.\u201d Rapanos v.

The controlling statutory provision, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), states that \u201cno court shall have\njurisdiction to review . . . any . . . decision . . . of the Attor\nney General . . . the authority for which is specified under\nthis subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cunder this\nsubchapter\u201d refers to Subchapter II of Chapter 12 of Title\n8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71151\u20131381, see ante, at 3, n. 3, and, as the\nCourt notes, no provision of Subchapter II confers discre\ntionary authority on the Attorney General to decide mo\ntions to reopen. See ante, at 7\u20138, 14\u201315. The Court of\nAppeals, however, held that the Attorney General\u2019s deci\nsion in this case was unreviewable because a regulation, 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (2009), made that decision discretionary.\n   If this regulation had been promulgated pursuant to\nauthority conferred by a provision of Subchapter II, we\nwould have to confront the question that the opinion of the\nCourt addresses. But it seems clear that 8 CFR \u00a71003.2,\nat least insofar as it gave the Attorney General the discre\ntionary authority that he exercised in this case, is\ngrounded on authority conferred under Subchapter I of\n2                        KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nChapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71101\u20131107. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71103(a) (1994 ed.) (giving the Attorney General\nthe authority to \u201cestablish such regulations . . . as he\ndeems necessary for carrying out his authority under\n[Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the U. S. Code]\u201d).\n   The amicus curiae whom we appointed to defend the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2 to Subchapter II. She notes that the Attor\nney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not\nonly 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter\nII, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b (1994 ed.). See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900,\n18904 (1996).1 This latter statutory provision2 conferred\nthe authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders,\ni.e., those issued after the alien failed to appear at the\ndeportation hearing. Although this statutory provision\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Two other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen,\nbut both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR \u00a71003.2\n(2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these\nprovisions. See ante 7, n. 9. Title 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), which ad\ndresses the procedural requirements for filing such a motion, and\n\u00a71252(b)(6), which requires consolidation of a motion to reopen with the\nunderlying removal order, were enacted as part of the Illegal Immigra\ntion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) in\nSeptember 1996 and made effective in April 1997. See 110 Stat. 3009\u2013\n593, 3009\u2013609. Prior to that time, the consolidation provision was\nfound in Subchapter I. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71105(a)(6) (1994 ed.).\n   2 This provision conferred the authority to rescind a deportation order\n\n\u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the\norder of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear\nwas because of exceptional circumstances . . . or upon a motion to\nreopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not\nreceive notice . . . or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in\nFederal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the\nalien.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b(c)(3) (1994 ed.).\n   A similar provision, enacted as part of IIRIRA, is now contained in 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C) (2006 ed.). As the Government notes, this\nprovision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the\ndenial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is gov\nerned by \u00a71229a(c)(7).

While the Attorney General\u2019s\n    regulation in point, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), places the reopening decision\n    within the BIA\u2019s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescrip\n    tion or otherwise \u201cspecif[y]\u201d that such decisions are in the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretion. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of deni\n    als of motions to reopen. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (1) The amicus defending the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment urges\n    that regulations suffice to trigger \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proscription.\n    She comprehends \u201cunder\u201d in \u201cauthority . . . specified under this sub\n    chapter\u201d to mean, e.g., \u201cpursuant to,\u201d \u201csubordinate to.\u201d Administra\n    tive regulations count for \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, be\n    cause they are issued \u201cpursuant to,\u201d and are measures \u201csubordinate\n    to,\u201d the legislation they serve to implement. On that reading,\n    \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an\n    executive regulation places within the BIA\u2019s discretion, including the\n    decision to deny a motion to reopen. The parties, on the other hand,\n    read the statutory language to mean \u201cspecified in,\u201d or \u201cspecified by,\u201d\n    the subchapter. On their reading, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judi\n    cial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary\n    character of the Attorney General\u2019s authority. Pp. 8\u20139.\n         (2) The word \u201cunder\u201d \u201chas many dictionary definitions and must\n    draw its meaning from its context.\u201d Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129,\n    135. Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the par\n    ties\u2019 position stands on firmer ground. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far\n    from IIRIRA\u2019s only jurisdictional limitation. It is sandwiched be\n    tween two subsections, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C), both de\n    pendent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define\n    their scope. Given \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, one would\n    expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone. Pp. 9\u201311.\n         (3) Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review\n    category \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n    1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the referenced\n    statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief\n    from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is\n    entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. Clause (i) does not re\n    fer to any regulatory provision. The proximity of clause (i) and the\n    clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other deci\n    sion\u201d\u2014suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\n    genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Read harmoni\n    ously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of dis\n    cretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute. Pp. 11\u201312.\n                   Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (4) Also significant is the character of the decisions insulated\nfrom judicial review in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i). The listed determinations\nare substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or\nnot aliens can stay in the country. Other decisions specified by stat\nute \u201cto be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d and therefore\nshielded from court oversight by \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71157(c)(1). Decisions on reopening motions made discre\ntionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings. A court deci\nsion reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the\nExecutive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches\nand concerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have been\naccorded a reasonable hearing. Had Congress wanted the jurisdic\ntional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regu\nlation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have\nsaid so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See, e.g., IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013572.\nPp. 12\u201314.\n      (5) The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates\nthis determination. Attorney General regulations have long ad\ndressed reopening requests. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simulta\nneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to\nbar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding re\nmoval. But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions. This legislative\nsilence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was pre-\nIIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney\nGeneral, \u201cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), but\ncourts retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. It is unsur\nprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this\n\u201cimportant [procedural] safeguard,\u201d Dada, 554 U. S., at ___, where,\nas here, the alien\u2019s underlying asylum claim would itself be review\nable. The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by\nadding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from re\nmoval, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of\ndecisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions\nto reopen. Pp. 14\u201316.\n   (c) Any lingering doubt about \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proper interpreta\ntion would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle:\nthe presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.\nWhen a statute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion,\u201d this Court adopts the reading \u201cthat executive determinations\ngenerally are subject to judicial review.\u201d Gutierrez de Martinez v.\nLamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434. The Court has consistently applied\nthis interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and par\n4                          KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ticularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court ju\n    risdiction. See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.\n    43, 63\u201364. Because this presumption is \u201c \u2018well-settled,\u2019 \u201d ibid., the\n    Court assumes that \u201cCongress legislates with knowledge of\u201d it,\n    McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496. It there\n    fore takes \u201c \u2018 \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d \u2019 \u201d to dislodge the pre\n    sumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64. There is no\n    such evidence here. Finally, reading \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to\n    matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would\n    ignore Congress\u2019 design to retain for itself control over federal-court\n    jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s construction would free the Ex\n    ecutive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate\n    court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions\n    \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\n    not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

ERIC H. HOLDER,\n          JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                               [January 20, 2010]\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Agron Kucana moved to reopen his removal\nproceedings, asserting new evidence in support of his plea\nfor asylum. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) sus\ntained the IJ\u2019s ruling, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\nreview the administrative determination. For that conclu\nsion, the court relied on a provision added to the Immigra\ntion and Nationality Act (INA or Act), 66 Stat. 166, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., by the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110\nStat. 3009\u2013546. The provision found dispositive by the\nSeventh Circuit, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), states that no\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the\nAttorney General \u201cthe authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor\nney General,\u201d \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription\nof judicial review stated in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) applies not only\nto Attorney General determinations made discretionary by\n2                   KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, but also to determinations declared discretionary\nby the Attorney General himself through regulation. We\nhold that the key words \u201cspecified under this subchapter\u201d\nrefer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We\nso rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial\nreview of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the\ntext and context of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), and the history of the\nrelevant statutory provisions. We take account, as well, of\nthe \u201cpresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to]\nallow judicial review of administrative action.\u201d Reno v.\nCatholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 63\u201364 (1993)\n(quoting McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.\n479, 496 (1991)). Separation-of-powers concerns, more\nover, caution us against reading legislation, absent clear\nstatement, to place in executive hands authority to remove\ncases from the Judiciary\u2019s domain.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n  In IIRIRA, Congress for the first time codified certain\nrules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney General, govern\ning the reopening process. The amended Act instructs\nthat reopening motions \u201cshall state the new facts that will\nbe proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,\nand shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary\nmaterial.\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B). Congress also prescribed that\n\u201cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the\ndate of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d\n\u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Among matters excepted from the 90\nday limitation are motions to reopen asylum applications\nbecause of changed conditions in the country of nationality\nor removal. \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).\n  Section 1252(a)(2), captioned \u201cMatters not subject to\njudicial review,\u201d contains the provision on which this case\nturns.

S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(D) in 2005 did not change the\noperative language of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as enacted in 1996.\n   The REAL ID Act amendments also inserted into this introductory\nclause, inter alia, the words \u201c(statutory or nonstatutory).\u201d\n\u00a7106(a)(1)(A)(ii), 119 Stat. 310. The introductory clause, however, does\nnot define the scope of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar.\nIt simply informs that once the scope of the bar is determined, jurisdic\ntion is precluded regardless of what any other provision or source of law\nmight say.\n   2 Sections 1182(h) and 1182(i) address waivers of inadmissibility\n\nbased on certain criminal offenses, and fraud or misrepresentation,\nrespectively; \u00a71229b addresses cancellation of removal; \u00a71229c, volun\ntary departure; and \u00a71255, adjustment of status.\n   3 \u201c[T]his subchapter\u201d refers to Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, of\n\nthe United States Code, codified at 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71151\u20131381 and titled\n\u201cImmigration.\u201d\n   4 The exception for relief under \u00a71158(a) refers to administrative deci\n\nsions whether to grant asylum.

Alleging that he would be persecuted based on\nhis political beliefs if returned to Albania, Kucana applied\nfor asylum and withholding of removal in 1996. An IJ\ndetermined that Kucana was removable and scheduled a\nhearing to evaluate his eligibility for asylum. When Ku\ncana failed to appear for the hearing, the IJ immediately\nordered his removal in absentia. Kucana filed a motion to\nreopen, explaining that he had missed his hearing because\nhe had overslept. The IJ denied the motion, and the BIA\naffirmed in 2002. Kucana did not seek judicial review, nor\ndid he leave the United States.\n  Kucana filed a second motion to reopen his removal\nproceedings in 2006, contending that conditions in Albania\nhad worsened.5 The BIA denied relief; it concluded that\nconditions in Albania had actually improved since 1997.\nArguing that the BIA had abused its discretion in denying\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlimited to the denial of his motion to reopen; he does not challenge in\nthis proceeding the decision denying his application for asylum.\n  5 The statute \u201cguarantees to each alien the right to file \u2018one motion to\n\nreopen proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Dada v.

Kucana v. Mukasey,\n533 F. 3d 534, 539 (2008). The court held that 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars judicial review not only of adminis\ntrative decisions made discretionary by statute, but also\n\u201cwhen the agency\u2019s discretion is specified by a regulation\nrather than a statute.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536.6 In so ruling,\nthe Seventh Circuit created a split between itself and\nother Courts of Appeals, all of them holding that denials of\nreopening motions are reviewable in court.7\n  Judge Ripple concurred dubitante. He acknowledged\nthat the court was following an earlier decision, Ali v.\nGonzales, 502 F. 3d 659 (CA7 2007),8 but \u201csuggest[ed]\nthat, had Congress intended to deprive th[e] court of juris\ndiction . . . , it would have done so explicitly, as it did in 8\nU.

The court,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 While recognizing that a regulation, rather than the INA itself,\n\nconfers on the Board discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen, the\nCourt of Appeals said that the regulation, \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] . . . force\nfrom provisions in the Act allowing immigration officials to govern their\nown proceedings.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536.

Given the absence of \u201cspecific\n[statutory] language entrusting the decision on a motion\nto reopen to the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted), he saw no impediment\nto the exercise of jurisdiction over Kucana\u2019s petition. In\nsupport of his position, Judge Cudahy invoked the \u201cstrong\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review of\nadministrative action.\u201d Id., at 541 (quoting Traynor v.\nTurnage, 485 U. S. 535, 542 (1988)). With four judges\ndissenting, the Seventh Circuit denied Kucana\u2019s petition\nfor rehearing en banc.

Mindful of the Board\u2019s\n\u201cbroad discretion\u201d in such matters, however, courts have\nemployed a deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of\nreview. See Doherty, 502 U. S., at 323 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n    The Seventh Circuit held that Congress removed the\nauthority long exercised by federal courts to review deni\nals of an alien\u2019s reopening request. Congress did so, the\nCourt of Appeals said, in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which removes\njurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General\n\u201cthe authority for which is specified under this subchapter\nto be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d All agree\nthat the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a),\nplaces \u201c[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen\n. . . within the discretion of the Board.\u201d But the statute\ndoes not codify that prescription,9 and does not otherwise\n\u201cspecif[y]\u201d that reopening decisions are \u201cin the discretion\nof the Attorney General.\u201d10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 As earlier noted, see supra, at 5, n. 6, the Seventh Circuit stated\n\nthat the regulation specifying the Board\u2019s discretion over motions to\nreopen, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] [its] force from provisions in the\nAct.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536 (citing 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7)). It is hard to see\nhow the regulation could draw force from \u00a71229a(c)(7), for the regula\ntion was already in force when that statutory provision was enacted.\nThe regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), was published April 29, 1996, 61\nFed. Reg. 18900, 18904; 8 U. S.

The Board has discretion\nto deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a).\nNevertheless, in defense of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judg\nment, amicus urges that regulations suffice to trigger 8\nU.

One can demur to the argument that Con\ngress anticipated that decisions on reopening motions would be discre\ntionary.

See\nDada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Davis v.

Section\n1252(a)(2), titled \u201cMatters not subject to judicial review,\u201d\nlists a variety of agency determinations the federal courts\nlack jurisdiction to review. Those determinations divide\ninto three categories. The first, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A), concerns\nimmigration officers\u2019 determinations whether aliens apply\ning for admission are admissible. Next in statutory order\nis the provision before us, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), which involves\ndenials of discretionary relief.        The last category,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(C), concerns final orders of removal entered\nagainst criminal aliens.\n   Both \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C) depend on statu\ntory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their\nscope. The latter provision, the criminal alien bar, pre\ncludes judicial review of \u201cany final order of removal\nagainst an alien who is removable by reason of having\ncommitted a criminal offense covered in\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2),\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or certain offenses\ncovered in \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(ii).

Given\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, sandwiched between\nsubsections (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(C), one would expect that\nit, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.\n                              3\n   Focusing on \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), we note the lead line serving\nto introduce both of the subparagraph\u2019s two clauses: \u201c[N]o\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review . . . .\u201d Clause (i)\nthen places within the no-judicial-review category \u201cany\njudgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the\nstatutory provisions referenced in clause (i) addresses a\ndifferent form of discretionary relief from removal, see\nsupra, at 3, n. 2, and each contains language indicating\nthat the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s\ndiscretion. See, e.g., \u00a71182(h) (\u201cThe Attorney General\nmay, in his discretion, waive [inadmissibility based on\ncertain criminal offenses].\u201d). Clause (i) does not refer to\nany regulatory provision.\n   To the clause (i) enumeration of administrative judg\nments that are insulated from judicial review, Congress\nadded in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering \u201cany\nother decision . . . the authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter.\u201d The proximity of clauses (i) and\n(ii), and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other decision\u201d\u2014\nsuggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\ngenre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation.13 The\nclause (i) enumeration, we find, is instructive in determin\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    13 Congress excepted from \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \u201cthe granting of relief\n\nunder [\u00a7]1158(a).\u201d Section 1158 concerns applications for asylum.\nAbsent the exception, asylum applicants might fall within\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar because a statutory provision,\n\u00a71158(b)(1)(A), specifies that \u201cthe Attorney General may grant asylum.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)

Decisions\non reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in\ncontrast, are adjunct rulings: The motion to reopen is a\nprocedural device serving to ensure \u201cthat aliens [a]re\ngetting a fair chance to have their claims heard.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17. A court decision reversing the denial of a\nmotion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford\nthe alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and\nconcerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have\nbeen accorded a reasonable hearing.\n   If Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass\ndecisions specified as discretionary by regulation along\nwith those made discretionary by statute, moreover, Con\ngress could easily have said so. In other provisions en\nacted simultaneously with \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress\nexpressed precisely that meaning. See IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110\nStat. 3009\u2013572 (\u201cimmigration benefits pursuant to this\nAct; or the regulations promulgated thereunder\u201d), codified\nat 8 U. S.

See 6 Fed. Reg. 71\u201372 (1941). The current\nregulations, adopted in 1996, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904\u201318906,\nderive from rules published in 1958, see 23 Fed. Reg.\n9118\u20139119; Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   Enacting IIRIRA in 1996, Congress \u201ctransform[ed] the\nmotion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statu\ntory form of relief available to the alien.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). IIRIRA largely codified the Attorney General\u2019s\ndirections on filing reopening motions. See \u00a71229a(c)(7)\n(guaranteeing right to file one motion, prescribing con\ntents, and setting deadlines).\n   In the same legislation, Congress amended the INA\naggressively to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal\nbasis to remain in the United States. See Reno v. Ameri\ncan-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475\n(1999). Among IIRIRA\u2019s several proscriptions of judicial\nreview is the one here at issue, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barring\nreview of administrative decisions Congress placed within\nthe Attorney General\u2019s discretion.\n   Congress thus simultaneously codified the process for\nfiling motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of\na number of executive decisions regarding removal. But\nCongress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. See 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (reopening may be entertained not only on\napplication; Board \u201cmay at any time reopen . . . on its own\nmotion any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d).\nHad Congress elected to insulate denials of motions to\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316), where, as here, the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim (for asylum) would itself be reviewable.17\n  In the REAL ID Act, Congress further amended the\nINA. By 2005, two Courts of Appeals had already ruled\nthat 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude them\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 A statement in the House Conference Report on IIRIRA, amicus\n\nsuggests, supports her argument that Congress intended broadly to\nforeclose judicial review of reopening denials.        Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 32\u201334. The\nreport states that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) \u201cbars judicial review . . . of any deci\nsion or action of the Attorney General which is specified to be in the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General.\u201d H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\u2013828,\np. 219 (1996). That statement, as we read it, simply summarizes the\nstatutory text at a general level. It does not home in on the question\nwhether decisions made discretionary only by regulation are judicially\nreviewable.\n   17 We do not reach the question whether review of a reopening denial\n\nwould be precluded if the court would lack jurisdiction over the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim for relief. Some courts confronting that question have\nrefused to consider petitions for review of a reopening denial that seeks\nto revisit the denial of the underlying claim; they have reasoned that\nhearing the petition would end-run the bar to review of the petitioner\u2019s\ncore claim. See, e.g., Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F. 3d 471, 473\u2013475 (CA5\n2004) (per curiam).\n16                     KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom reviewing denials of motions to reopen, see Infanzon\nv. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1359, 1361\u20131362 (CA10 2004); Me\ndina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 520, 528\u2013529 (CA9\n2004), and no court had reached a contrary result. Al\nthough adding or reformulating provisions on asylum,\n\u00a7101(a), (b), 119 Stat. 302\u2013303, protection from removal,\n\u00a7101(c), (d), id., at 303\u2013305, even judicial review, \u00a7106, id.,\nat 310\u2013311, the REAL ID Act did not disturb the unbroken\nline of decisions upholding court review of administrative\ndenials of motions to reopen. See supra, at 6\u20137; supra, at\n3, n. 1.18\n                              IV\n   Any lingering doubt about the proper interpretation of 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be dispelled by a familiar\nprinciple of statutory construction: the presumption favor\ning judicial review of administrative action. When a\nstatute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion, we adopt the reading that accords with traditional\nunderstandings and basic principles: that executive de\nterminations generally are subject to judicial review.\u201d\nGutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434\n(1995). We have consistently applied that interpretive\nguide to legislation regarding immigration, and particu\nlarly to questions concerning the preservation of federal\ncourt jurisdiction. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,\n298 (2001); Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 63\u2013\n64; McNary, 498 U. S., at 496.

Courts\nof Appeals have held that such decisions are unreviewable because\nsua sponte reopening is committed to agency discretion by law, see 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7701(a)(2). See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey, 521 F. 3d 1000,\n1003\u20131004 (CA8 2008) (en banc) (per curiam) (agreeing with ten other\nCourts of Appeals).\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 63\u201364 (quoting McNary,\n498 U. S., at 496), the Court assumes that \u201cCongress\nlegislates with knowledge of\u201d the presumption, id., at 496.\nIt therefore takes \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to dis\nlodge the presumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509\nU. S., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is\nno such evidence here.\n  Finally, we stress a paramount factor in the decision we\nrender today. By defining the various jurisdictional bars\nby reference to other provisions in the INA itself, Congress\nensured that it, and only it, would limit the federal courts\u2019\njurisdiction. To read \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters\nwhere discretion is conferred on the Board by regulation,\nrather than on the Attorney General by statute, would\nignore that congressional design. If the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Ex\necutive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions\nfrom abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by\nissuing a regulation declaring those decisions \u201cdiscretion\nary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\nnot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.\n                               V\n  A statute affecting federal jurisdiction \u201cmust be con\nstrued both with precision and with fidelity to the terms\nby which Congress has expressed its wishes.\u201d Cheng Fan\nKwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968). As we have noted,\nsee supra, at 14, and as amicus emphasizes, \u201cmany provi\nsions of IIRIRA [we]re aimed at protecting [from court\nreview exercises of] the Executive\u2019s discretion.\u201d American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 486 (em\nphasis deleted). But \u201cno law pursues its purpose at all\ncosts, and . . . the textual limitations upon a law\u2019s scope\nare no less a part of its \u2018purpose\u2019 than its substantive\nauthorizations.\u201d Rapanos v.

While Congress pared back\njudicial review in IIRIRA, it did not delegate to the Execu\ntive authority to do so.

ERIC H. HOLDER,\n          JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                        [January 20, 2010]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to\nreview the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen his\nremoval proceeding, but I would decide this case on nar\nrower grounds. The controlling statutory provision, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), states that \u201cno court shall have\njurisdiction to review . . . any . . . decision . . . of the Attor\nney General . . . the authority for which is specified under\nthis subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cunder this\nsubchapter\u201d refers to Subchapter II of Chapter 12 of Title\n8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71151\u20131381, see ante, at 3, n. 3, and, as the\nCourt notes, no provision of Subchapter II confers discre\ntionary authority on the Attorney General to decide mo\ntions to reopen. See ante, at 7\u20138, 14\u201315. The Court of\nAppeals, however, held that the Attorney General\u2019s deci\nsion in this case was unreviewable because a regulation, 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (2009), made that decision discretionary.\n   If this regulation had been promulgated pursuant to\nauthority conferred by a provision of Subchapter II, we\nwould have to confront the question that the opinion of the\nCourt addresses. But it seems clear that 8 CFR \u00a71003.2,\nat least insofar as it gave the Attorney General the discre\ntionary authority that he exercised in this case, is\ngrounded on authority conferred under Subchapter I of\n2                        KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nChapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71101\u20131107. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71103(a) (1994 ed.) (giving the Attorney General\nthe authority to \u201cestablish such regulations . . . as he\ndeems necessary for carrying out his authority under\n[Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the U. S. Code]\u201d).\n   The amicus curiae whom we appointed to defend the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2 to Subchapter II. She notes that the Attor\nney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not\nonly 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter\nII, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b (1994 ed.). See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900,\n18904 (1996).1 This latter statutory provision2 conferred\nthe authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders,\ni.e., those issued after the alien failed to appear at the\ndeportation hearing. Although this statutory provision\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Two other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen,\nbut both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR \u00a71003.2\n(2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these\nprovisions. See ante 7, n. 9. Title 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), which ad\ndresses the procedural requirements for filing such a motion, and\n\u00a71252(b)(6), which requires consolidation of a motion to reopen with the\nunderlying removal order, were enacted as part of the Illegal Immigra\ntion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) in\nSeptember 1996 and made effective in April 1997. See 110 Stat. 3009\u2013\n593, 3009\u2013609. Prior to that time, the consolidation provision was\nfound in Subchapter I. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71105(a)(6) (1994 ed.).\n   2 This provision conferred the authority to rescind a deportation order\n\n\u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the\norder of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear\nwas because of exceptional circumstances . . . or upon a motion to\nreopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not\nreceive notice . . . or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in\nFederal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the\nalien.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b(c)(3) (1994 ed.).\n   A similar provision, enacted as part of IIRIRA, is now contained in 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C) (2006 ed.). As the Government notes, this\nprovision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the\ndenial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is gov\nerned by \u00a71229a(c)(7).

At most, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b (1994 ed.) may be read\nas implicitly authorizing the promulgation of a regulation\ngiving the Attorney General the discretion to reopen cer\ntain deportation orders that were issued in absentia.\nPetitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen, however, seeks re\nopening on grounds outside of \u00a71252b, and therefore 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2, insofar as it applies to petitioner\u2019s case, was\nnot issued pursuant to Subchapter II and does not imple\nment any provision of that Subchapter.\n   For these reasons, this case can and should be decided\non the narrow ground that, even if some regulations can\nrender a decision of the Attorney General unreviewable,\nthe regulation at issue in this case does not have that\neffect.\n</pre>",
