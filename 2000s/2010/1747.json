KRISTIN M. \n\n                PERRY ET AL. \n\n                 ON APPLICATION FOR STAY\n                      [January 13, 2010]\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  We are asked to stay the broadcast of a federal trial. We\nresolve that question without expressing any view on\nwhether such trials should be broadcast. We instead\ndetermine that the broadcast in this case should be stayed\nbecause it appears the courts below did not follow the\nappropriate procedures set forth in federal law before\nchanging their rules to allow such broadcasting. Courts\nenforce the requirement of procedural regularity on oth\ners, and must follow those requirements themselves.\n                         *    *     *\n   This lawsuit, still in a preliminary stage, involves an\naction challenging what the parties refer to as Proposition\n8, a California ballot proposition adopted by the electorate.\nProposition 8 amended the State Constitution by adding a\nnew section providing that \u201c[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\u201d\nCal. Const. Art. I, \u00a77.5. The plaintiffs contend that Propo\nsition 8 violates the United States Constitution. A bench\ntrial in the case began on Monday, January 11, 2010, in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District\nof California.\n   The District Court has issued an order permitting the\ntrial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to\na number of federal courthouses around the country. The\n2                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\norder was issued pursuant to a purported amendment to a\nlocal Rule of the District Court. That Rule had previously\nforbidden the broadcasting of trials outside the courthouse\nin which a trial takes place. The District Court effected its\namendment via several postings on the District Court\u2019s\nWeb site in the days immediately before the trial in this\ncase was to begin.\n  Applicants here are defendant-intervenors in the law\nsuit. They object to the District Court\u2019s order, arguing\nthat the District Court violated a federal statute by prom\nulgating the amendment to its local Rule without suffi\ncient opportunity for notice and comment and that the\npublic broadcast would violate their due process rights to a\nfair and impartial trial. Applicants seek a stay of the\norder pending the filing of petitions for writs of certiorari\nand mandamus. We granted a temporary stay to consider\nthe issue further. Post, p. ___. Concluding that the appli\ncants have made a sufficient showing of entitlement to\nrelief, we now grant a stay.\n                              I\n  Proposition 8 was passed by California voters in No\nvember 2008. It was a ballot proposition designed to\noverturn a ruling by the California Supreme Court that\nhad given same-sex couples a right to marry. Proposition\n8 was and is the subject of public debate throughout the\nState and, indeed, nationwide. Its advocates claim that\nthey have been subject to harassment as a result of public\ndisclosure of their support. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Ap\npellant 28\u201329 in Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm\u2019n, No. 08\u2013205, now pending before this Court. For\nexample, donors to groups supporting Proposition 8 \u201chave\nreceived death threats and envelopes containing a pow\ndery white substance.\u201d Stone, Prop 8 Donor Web Site\nShows Disclosure is a 2-Edged Sword, N. Y. Times, Feb. 8,\n2009. Some advocates claim that they have received\n                  Cite as: 588 U.

Federal Election Comm\u2019n, No.\n08\u2013205, now pending before this Court. Opponents of\nProposition 8 also are alleged to have compiled \u201cInternet\nblacklists\u201d of pro-Proposition 8 businesses and urged\nothers to boycott those businesses in retaliation for sup\nporting the ballot measure. Carlton, Gay Activists Boycott\nBackers of Prop 8, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 27, 2008, A3.\nAnd numerous instances of vandalism and physical vio\nlence have been reported against those who have been\nidentified as Proposition 8 supporters. See Exhs. B, I, and\nL to Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion for Protective Order in\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, No. 3:09\u2013cv\u201302292 (ND Cal.)\n(hereinafter Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion).\n   Respondents filed suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, seeking to\ninvalidate Proposition 8. They contend that the amend\nment to the State\u2019s Constitution violates the Equal Protec\ntion and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amend\nment of the United States Constitution. The State of\nCalifornia declined to defend Proposition 8, and the defen\ndant-intervenors (who are the applicants here) entered the\nsuit to defend its constitutionality. A bench trial began on\nMonday, January 11, 2010, before the Chief Judge of the\nDistrict Court, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker.\n   On September 25, 2009, the District Court informed the\nparties at a hearing that there was interest in the possibil\nity that the trial would be broadcast. Respondents indi\ncated their support for the idea, while applicants opposed\nit. The court noted that \u201c[t]here are, of course, Judicial\nConference positions on this,\u201d but also that \u201c[t]his is all in\nflux.\u201d Exh. 9, p. 72, App. to Pet. for Mandamus in No. 10\u2013\n4               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n70063 (CA9) (hereinafter App. to Pet.).\n   One month later, Chief Judge Kozinski of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appointed a\nthree-judge committee to evaluate the possibility of adopt\ning a Ninth Circuit Rule regarding the recording and\ntransmission of district court proceedings. The committee\n(of which Chief Judge Walker was a member) recom\nmended to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council that district\ncourts be permitted to experiment with broadcasting court\nproceedings on a trial basis. Chief Judge Walker later\nacknowledged that while the committee was considering\nthe pilot program, \u201cthis case was very much in mind at\nthat time because it had come to prominence then and was\nthought to be an ideal candidate for consideration.\u201d Id.,\nExh. 2, at 42. The committee did not publicly disclose its\nconsideration of the proposal, nor did it solicit or receive\npublic comments on the proposal.\n   On December 17, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council\nissued a news release indicating that it had approved a\npilot program for \u201cthe limited use of cameras in federal\ndistrict courts within the circuit.\u201d Id., Exh. 13, at 1. The\nrelease explained that the Council\u2019s decision \u201camend[ed] a\n1996 Ninth Circuit policy\u201d that had banned the photo\ngraphing, as well as radio and television coverage, of court\nproceedings. Ibid. The release further indicated that\ncases would be selected for participation in the program\n\u201cby the chief judge of the district court in consultation\nwith the chief circuit judge.\u201d Ibid. No further guidelines\nfor participation in the pilot program have since been\nissued.\n   On December 21, a coalition of media companies re\nquested permission from the District Court to televise the\ntrial challenging Proposition 8. Two days later, the court\nindicated on its Web site that it had amended Civil Local\nRule 77\u20133, which had previously banned the recording or\nbroadcast of court proceedings. The revised version of\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nRule 77\u20133 created an exception to this general prohibition\nto allow \u201cfor participation in a pilot or other project au\nthorized by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Id.,\nExh. 14. Applicants objected to the revision, arguing that\nany change to Ninth Circuit or local rules would require a\nsufficient notice and comment period.\n   On December 31, the District Court revised its Web site\nto remove the previous announcement about the change to\nRule 77\u20133. A new announcement was posted indicating a\n\u201cproposed revision of Civil Local Rule 77\u20133,\u201d which had\nbeen \u201capproved for public comment.\u201d Id., Exh. 17. The\nproposed revision was the same as the previously an\nnounced amendment. Comments on the proposed revision\nwere to be submitted by Friday, January 8, 2010.\n   On January 4, 2010, the District Court again revised its\nWeb site. The announcement regarding the proposed\nrevision of Rule 77\u20133 was removed and replaced with a\nthird version of the announcement. This third version\nstated that the revised Rule was \u201ceffective December 22,\n2009,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he revised rule was adopted pursuant\nto the \u2018immediate need\u2019 provision of Title 28 Section\n2071(e).\u201d Id., Exh. 19, at 3.\n   On January 6, 2010, the District Court held a hearing\nregarding the recording and broadcasting of the upcoming\ntrial. The court announced that an audio and video feed of\ntrial proceedings would be streamed live to certain court\nhouses in other cities. It also announced that, pending\napproval of the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, the trial\nwould be recorded and then broadcast on the Internet. A\ncourt technician explained that the proceedings would be\nrecorded by three cameras, and then the resulting broad\ncast would be uploaded for posting on the Internet, with a\ndelay due to processing requirements.\n   On January 7, 2010, the District Court filed an order\nformally requesting that Chief Judge Kozinski approve\n\u201cinclusion of the trial in the pilot project on the terms and\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconditions discussed at the January 6, 2010, hearing and\nsubject to resolution of certain technical issues.\u201d Id., Exh.\n1, at 2. Applicants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus\nin the Court of Appeals, seeking to prohibit or stay the\nDistrict Court from enforcing its order. The following day,\na three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals denied the\npetition.\n   On January 8, 2010, Chief Judge Kozinski issued an\norder approving the District Court\u2019s decision to allow real\ntime streaming of the trial to certain federal courthouses\nlisted in a simultaneously issued press release. Five\nlocations had been selected: federal courthouses in San\nFrancisco, Pasadena, Seattle, Portland, and Brooklyn.\nThe press release also indicated that \u201c[a]dditional sites\nmay be announced.\u201d Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote\nViewing       of   Proposition     8    Trial,    online   at\nhttp://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/\nProp8_Remote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13,\n2010, and available in the Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   Chief Judge Kozinski\u2019s January 8 order noted that the\nrequest to broadcast the trial on the Internet was \u201cstill\npending\u201d before him. In a later letter to Chief Judge\nWalker, he explained that the request was not yet \u201cripe for\napproval\u201d because \u201cthe technical staff encountered some\nunexpected difficulties preparing a satisfactory video\nsuitable for on-line posting.\u201d Letter of Jan. 9, 2010 (avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A final decision whether\nto permit online publication would be made when techni\ncal difficulties were resolved.\n   On January 9, 2010, applicants filed in this Court an\napplication for a stay of the District Court\u2019s order. Their\npetition seeks a stay pending resolution of forthcoming\npetitions for the writs of certiorari and mandamus.\n                            II\n    The question whether courtroom proceedings should be\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nbroadcast has prompted considerable national debate.\nReasonable minds differ on the proper resolution of that\ndebate and on the restrictions, circumstances, and proce\ndures under which such broadcasts should occur. We do\nnot here express any views on the propriety of broadcast\ning court proceedings generally.\n  Instead, our review is confined to a narrow legal issue:\nwhether the District Court\u2019s amendment of its local rules\nto broadcast this trial complied with federal law. We\nconclude that it likely did not and that applicants have\ndemonstrated that irreparable harm would likely result\nfrom the District Court\u2019s actions. We therefore stay the\ncourt\u2019s January 7, 2010, order to the extent that it permits\nthe live streaming of court proceedings to other federal\ncourthouses. We do not address other aspects of that\norder, such as those related to the broadcast of court pro\nceedings on the Internet, as this may be premature.\n                              A\n   To obtain a stay pending the filing and disposition of a\npetition for a writ of certiorari, an applicant must show\n(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider\nthe issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a\nfair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to\nreverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that\nirreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay. In\nclose cases the Circuit Justice or the Court will balance\nthe equities and weigh the relative harms to the applicant\nand to the respondent. Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S.\n1301, 1304 (1988) (KENNEDY, J., in chambers); Rostker v.\nGoldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in\nchambers). To obtain a stay pending the filing and dispo\nsition of a petition for a writ of mandamus, an applicant\nmust show a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will\nvote to grant mandamus and a likelihood that irreparable\nharm will result from the denial of a stay. Before a writ of\n8                 HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nmandamus may issue, a party must establish that (1) \u201cno\nother adequate means [exist] to attain the relief he de\nsires,\u201d (2) the party\u2019s \u201cright to issuance of the writ is \u2018clear\nand indisputable,\u2019 \u201d and (3) \u201cthe writ is appropriate under\nthe circumstances.\u201d Cheney v. United States Dist. Court\nfor D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380\u2013381 (2004) (some internal\nquotation marks omitted). This Court will issue the writ\nof mandamus directly to a federal district court \u201conly\nwhere a question of public importance is involved, or\nwhere the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly\nappropriate that such action by this court should be\ntaken.\u201d Ex parte United States, 287 U. S. 241, 248\u2013249\n(1932). These familiar standards are followed here, where\napplicants claim that the District Court\u2019s order was based\non a local rule adopted in violation of federal law.\n                               B\n   Given the importance of the issues at stake, and our\nconclusion that the District Court likely violated a federal\nstatute in revising its local rules, applicants have shown a\nfair prospect that a majority of this Court will either grant\na petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the order\nbelow or will grant a petition for a writ of mandamus.\n   A district court has discretion to adopt local rules.\nFrazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, 645 (1987) (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83). Those rules have\n\u201cthe force of law.\u201d Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 169\n(1929). Federal law, however, requires a district court to\nfollow certain procedures to adopt or amend a local rule.\nLocal rules typically may not be amended unless the\ndistrict court \u201cgiv[es] appropriate public notice and an\nopportunity for comment.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72071(b); see also\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83(a). A limited exception permits\ndispensing with this notice-and-comment requirement\nonly where \u201cthere is an immediate need for a rule.\u201d\n\u00a72071(e). Even where a rule is amended based on imme\n                 Cite as: 588 U.

Electronic transmittal of courtroom pro\n    ceedings and presentation of evidence within the con\n    fines of the courthouse is permitted, if authorized by\n    the Judge or Magistrate Judge. The term \u2018environs,\u2019\n    as used in this rule, means all floors on which cham\n    bers, courtrooms or on which Offices of the Clerk are\n    located, with the exception of any space specifically\n    designated as a Press Room. Nothing in this rule is\n    intended to restrict the use of electronic means to re\n    ceive or present evidence during Court proceedings.\u201d\nNotably, the Rule excepted from its general ban the trans\nmittal of certain proceedings\u2014but it limited that exception\nto transmissions \u201cwithin the confines of the courthouse.\u201d\nThe negative inference of this exception, of course, is that\nthe Rule would have prohibited the streaming of trans\nmissions, or other broadcasting or televising, beyond \u201cthe\nconfines of the courthouse.\u201d\n   Respondents do not dispute that this version of Rule 77\u2013\n3 would have prohibited streaming video of the trial\naround the country. But they assert that this is not the\noperative version of Rule 77\u20133. In a series of postings on\nits Web site, the District Court purported to revise or\npropose revisions to Local Rule 77\u20133. This amendment\nwould have created an additional exception to Rule 77\u20133\u2019s\n10               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ngeneral ban on the broadcasting of court proceedings \u201cfor\nparticipation in a pilot or other project authorized by the\nJudicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Exh. 14, App. to\nPet. Respondents rely on this amended version of the\nRule.\n   The amended version of Rule 77\u20133 appears to be invalid.\nIn amending this rule, it appears that the District Court\nfailed to \u201cgiv[e] appropriate public notice and an opportu\nnity for comment,\u201d as required by federal law. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72071(b). The first time the District Court asked for pub\nlic comments was on the afternoon of New Year\u2019s Eve.\nThe court stated that it would leave the comment period\nopen until January 8. At most, the District Court there\nfore allowed a comment period spanning five business\ndays. There is substantial merit to the argument that this\nwas not \u201cappropriate\u201d notice and an opportunity for com\nment. Administrative agencies, for instance, \u201cusually\u201d\nprovide a comment period of \u201cthirty days or more.\u201d River\nbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F. 2d 1479, 1484 (CA9\n1992); see Petry v. Block, 737 F. 2d 1193, 1201 (CADC\n1984) (\u201c[T]he shortest period in which parties can mean\ningfully review a proposed rule and file informed re\nsponses is thirty days\u201d).\n   To be sure, the possibility that some aspects of the trial\nmight be broadcast was first raised to the parties by the\nDistrict Court at an in-court hearing on September 25,\nsome three months before the Rule was changed. The\nbroadcasting, however, was prohibited under both Circuit\nand local rules at that time. The first public indication\nthat the District Court intended to adopt a rule of general\napplicability came in its Web site posting on December 23.\nAnd even if Chief Judge Walker\u2019s in-court allusion to the\npossibility that the Proposition 8 trial might be broadcast\ncould be considered as providing notice to the parties in\nthis case\u2014his statement that \u201c[t]his is all in flux\u201d notwith\nstanding\u2014the disclosure falls far short of the \u201cappropriate\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npublic notice and an opportunity for comment\u201d required by\n\u00a72071(b). Indeed, there was no proposed policy on which\nto comment.\n   The need for a meaningful comment period was particu\nlarly acute in this case. Both courts and legislatures have\nproceeded with appropriate caution in addressing this\nquestion. In 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United\nStates adopted a policy opposing the public broadcast of\ncourt proceedings. This policy was adopted after a multi\nyear study of the issue by the Federal Judicial Center\nwhich drew on data from six district and two appellate\ncourts, as well as state-court data. In light of the study\u2019s\nfindings, the Judicial Conference concluded that \u201cthe\nintimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and\njurors [is] cause for concern.\u201d Report of the Proceedings of\nthe Judicial Conference of the United States 47 (Sept. 20,\n1994).\n   In more than a decade since its adoption the Judicial\nConference has continued to adhere to its position on the\nbroadcast of court proceedings. While the policy conclu\nsions of the Judicial Conference may not be binding on the\nlower courts, they are \u201cat the very least entitled to respect\nful consideration.\u201d In re Sony BMG Music Entertainment,\n564 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2009). Before abandoning its own\npolicy\u2014one consistent with the Judicial Conference\u2019s\nlongstanding views\u2014it was incumbent on the District\nCourt to adopt a proposed rule only after notice and an\nadequate period for public comment.\n   In dispensing with public notice and comment the Dis\ntrict Court invoked the \u201cimmediate need\u201d exception. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071(e). It did so through a Web site posting on\nJanuary 4\u2014prior to the expiration of the comment pe\nriod\u2014indicating that Rule 77\u20133 had been revised to per\nmit participation in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s pilot program.\nThese postings gave no explanation for invoking the ex\nception. At trial the District Court explained that the\n12              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nimmediate need here was to allow this case to be broad\ncast pursuant to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s new pilot program.\nSee Exh. 1, p. 11, Supp. App. to Response for Perry et al.\n   This does not qualify as an immediate need that justi\nfies dispensing with the notice and comment procedures\nrequired by federal law. While respondents (the plaintiffs\nin the District Court) had indicated their approval of the\nplan, no party alleged that it would be imminently harmed\nif the trial were not broadcast. Had an administrative\nagency acted as the District Court did here, the immediate\nneed exception would likely not have been available. See\n5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(b)(B) (administrative agencies cannot\ninvoke an exception to affording notice-and-comment\nbefore rulemaking unless the notice-and-comment proce\ndures would be \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to\nthe public interest\u201d). In issuing its order the District\nCourt relied on the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council\u2019s pilot\nprogram. Yet nothing in that program\u2014which was not\nadopted after notice and comment procedures, cf. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7332(d)(1)\u2014required any \u201cimmediate\u201d revision in\nlocal rules. The Ninth Circuit Judicial Council did not\npurport to modify or abrogate the District Court\u2019s local\nRule. Nor could it, as the Judicial Council only has the\npower to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with\nfederal law. See \u00a7332(d)(4) (permitting a circuit court\ncouncil to modify a local rule that is \u201cfound inconsistent\u201d\nwith rules promulgated by the Supreme Court). No fed\neral law requires that the District Court broadcast some of\nits cases. The District Court\u2019s local Rule, in addition, was\nnot a conforming amendment to Ninth Circuit policy,\nbecause that policy does not require district courts to\nbroadcast proceedings.\n   Applicants also have shown that irreparable harm will\nlikely result from the denial of the stay. Without a stay,\nthe District Court will broadcast the trial. It would be\ndifficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to reverse the harm from\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthose broadcasts. The trial will involve various witnesses,\nincluding members of same-sex couples; academics, who\napparently will discuss gender issues and gender equality,\nas well as family structures; and those who participated in\nthe campaign leading to the adoption of Proposition 8.\nThis Court has recognized that witness testimony may be\nchilled if broadcast. See Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 547\n(1965); id., at 591 (Harlan, J., concurring). Some of appli\ncants\u2019 witnesses have already said that they will not tes\ntify if the trial is broadcast, and they have substantiated\ntheir concerns by citing incidents of past harassment. See,\ne.g., Exh. K to Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion (71 news\narticles detailing incidents of harassment related to people\nwho supported Proposition 8). These concerns are not\ndiminished by the fact that some of applicants\u2019 witnesses\nare compensated expert witnesses. There are qualitative\ndifferences between making public appearances regarding\nan issue and having one\u2019s testimony broadcast throughout\nthe country. Applicants may not be able to obtain ade\nquate relief through an appeal. The trial will have already\nbeen broadcast. It is difficult to demonstrate or analyze\nwhether a witness would have testified differently if his or\nher testimony had not been broadcast. And witnesses\nsubject to harassment as a result of broadcast of their\ntestimony might be less likely to cooperate in any future\nproceedings.\n   The balance of equities favors applicants. While appli\ncants have demonstrated the threat of harm they face if\nthe trial is broadcast, respondents have not alleged any\nharm if the trial is not broadcast. The issue, moreover,\nmust be resolved at this stage, for the injury likely cannot\nbe undone once the broadcast takes place.\n   This Court also has a significant interest in supervising\nthe administration of the judicial system. See this Court\u2019s\nRule 10(a) (the Court will consider whether the courts\nbelow have \u201cso far departed from the accepted and usual\n14               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncourse of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise\nof this Court\u2019s supervisory power\u201d). The Court may use its\nsupervisory authority to invalidate local rules that were\npromulgated in violation of an Act of Congress. See Fra\nzier, 482 U. S., at 645\u2013646; id., at 652, 654 (Rehnquist,\nC. J., dissenting). The Court\u2019s interest in ensuring com\npliance with proper rules of judicial administration is\nparticularly acute when those rules relate to the integrity\nof judicial processes. The District Court here attempted to\nrevise its rules in haste, contrary to federal statutes and\nthe policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States.\nIt did so to allow broadcasting of this high-profile trial\nwithout any considered standards or guidelines in place.\nThe arguments in favor of developing procedures and rules\nto allow broadcast of certain cases have considerable\nmerit, and reasonable minds can surely differ over the\ngeneral and specific terms of rules and standards adopted\nfor that purpose. Here, however, the order in question\ncomplied neither with existing rules or policies nor the\nrequired procedures for amending them.\n   By insisting that courts comply with the law, parties\nvindicate not only the rights they assert but also the law\u2019s\nown insistence on neutrality and fidelity to principle.\nThose systematic interests are all the more evident here,\nwhere the lack of a regular rule with proper standards to\ndetermine the guidelines for broadcasting could compro\nmise the orderly, decorous, rational traditions that courts\nrely upon to ensure the integrity of their own judgments.\nThese considerations, too, are part of the reasons leading\nto the decision to grant extraordinary relief.\n   In addressing a discrete instance authorizing a closed\ncircuit broadcast of a trial, Congress has illustrated the\nneed for careful guidelines and standards. The trial of the\ntwo defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case had\nbeen transferred to the United States District Court for\nthe District of Colorado, so it was set to take place in\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nDenver. That meant the families of deceased and surviv\ning victims in and around Oklahoma City would not have\nthe opportunity to observe the trial. Congress passed a\nstatute that allowed victims\u2019 families to watch the trial on\nclosed-circuit television. 42 U. S. C. \u00a710608. The statute\nwas drawn with care to provide precise and detailed guid\nance with respect to the wide range of issues implicated by\nthe broadcast. See \u00a710608(a) (the statute only applies \u201cin\ncases where the venue of the trial is changed\u201d to a city\nthat is \u201cout of the State\u201d and \u201cmore than 350 miles from\nthe location in which those proceedings originally would\nhave taken place\u201d); \u00a7\u00a710608(a)\u2013(b) (standards for who can\nview such trials); \u00a710608(c) (restrictions on transmission).\nAnd the statute gave the Judicial Conference of the United\nStates rulemaking authority \u201cto effectuate the policy\naddressed by this section.\u201d \u00a710608(g). In the present case,\nby contrast, over a span of three weeks the District Court\nand Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued, retracted, and\nreissued a series of Web site postings and news releases.\nThese purport to amend rules and policies at the heart of\nan ongoing consideration of broadcasting federal trials.\nAnd they have done so to make sure that one particular\ntrial may be broadcast. Congress\u2019 requirement of a notice\nand comment procedure prevents just such arbitrary\nchanges of court rules. Instead, courts must use the pro\ncedures prescribed by statute to amend their rules, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071.\n   If Local Rule 77\u20133 had been validly revised, questions\nwould still remain about the District Court\u2019s decision to\nallow broadcasting of this particular trial, in which several\nof the witnesses have stated concerns for their own secu\nrity. Even districts that allow trials to be broadcast, see\nCiv. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule 1.8 (EDNY 2009),\nrecognize that a district judge\u2019s discretion to broadcast a\ntrial is limited, see, e.g., Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, 942\nF. Supp. 136, 138 (EDNY 1996) (broadcast forbidden\n16              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nunless \u201cthere is no interference with the due process, the\ndignity of litigants, jurors and witnesses, or with other\nappropriate aspects of the administration of justice\u201d).\nConsequently, courts in those districts have allowed the\nbroadcast of their proceedings on the basis that those\ncases were not high profile, E*Trade Financial Corp. v.\nDeutsche Bank AG, 582 F. Supp. 2d 528, 535 (SDNY\n2008), or did not involve witnesses, Marisol A. v. Giuliani,\n929 F. Supp. 660, 661 (SDNY 1996); Katzman v. Victoria\u2019s\nSecret Catalogue, 923 F. Supp. 580, 586\u2013587 (SDNY 1996).\nIndeed, one District Court did not allow the broadcasting\nof its proceedings because the case \u201cinvolv[ed] very sensi\ntive issues.\u201d Schoeps v. Museum of Modern Art, 599\nF. Supp. 2d 532, 534 (SDNY 2009). This case, too, in\nvolves issues subject to intense debate in our society. The\nDistrict Court intends not only to broadcast the attorneys\u2019\narguments but also witness testimony. See Sony BMG,\n564 F. 3d, at 11 (Lipez, J., concurring) (distinguishing\nbroadcast of attorneys\u2019 arguments from other parts of the\ntrial). This case is therefore not a good one for a pilot\nprogram. Even the studies that have been conducted thus\nfar have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high\nprofile, divisive cases. See Application for Stay 17 (warn\ning by Judge Edward R. Becker that in \u201c \u2018truly high-profile\ncases,\u2019 \u201d one can \u201c \u2018[j]ust imagine what the findings would\nbe\u2019 \u201d (quoting Exh. 21, at 2, App. to Pet.)).\n                            III\n   The District Court attempted to change its rules at the\neleventh hour to treat this case differently than other\ntrials in the district. Not only did it ignore the federal\nstatute that establishes the procedures by which its rules\nmay be amended, its express purpose was to broadcast a\nhigh-profile trial that would include witness testimony\nabout a contentious issue. If courts are to require that\nothers follow regular procedures, courts must do so as\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwell. The Court grants the application for a stay of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order of January 7, 2010, pending the\ntimely filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari or the filing and disposition of a petition for a\nwrit of mandamus.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

See ante, at 6\u20137;\nRostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S., 1306, 1308 (1980) (Bren\nnan, J., in chambers) (stay standard); Cheney v. United\nStates Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004)\n(noting that mandamus is a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary\nremedy reserved for really extraordinary causes\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This case, in my view, does not\nsatisfy a single one of these standards, let alone all of\nthem. Consequently, I must dissent.\n  First, consider the merits of the legal issue: The United\nStates Code, in a chapter entitled \u201cRules of Courts,\u201d states\n2               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat \u201c[a]ny rule . . . shall be prescribed only after giving\nappropriate public notice and an opportunity for com\nment.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72071(b). The question here is whether\nthe District Court accompanied the modification of its\nantivideo rule with \u201cappropriate public notice and an\nopportunity for comment.\u201d\n  Certainly the parties themselves had more than ade\nquate notice and opportunity to comment before the Rule\nwas changed. On September 25, 2009, the trial judge,\nChief Judge Vaughn Walker, discussed the possibility of\nbroadcasting trial proceedings both within the courthouse\nand beyond, and asked for the parties\u2019 views. No party\nobjected to the presence of cameras in the courtroom for\ntransmissions within the courthouse, Exh. 9, p. 70, App. to\nPet. for Mandamus in No. 10\u201370063 (CA9) (hereinafter\nApp. to Pet.). (\u201cNo objection. None at all\u201d), and both sides\nmade written submissions to the court regarding their\nviews on other transmissions. The court again raised the\nissue at a hearing on December 16.\n  Nor, in practice, did other members of the Judiciary lack\ninformation about the issue. In May 1996 the Circuit\nCouncil adopted a policy permitting video in connection\nwith appellate proceedings, but prohibiting its use in the\ndistrict court. Subsequently, appellate court panels have\nfrequently permitted electronic coverage. Judges, the\npress, lawyers, and others have discussed the matter. In\n2007 the lawyers and judges present at the Ninth Circuit\nJudicial Conference considered a resolution that favored\nthe use of cameras in district court civil nonjury proceed\nings. And, voting separately, both lawyers and judges\n\u201capproved the resolution by resounding margins.\u201d Letter\nfrom Chief Judge Kozinski to Judge Anthony Scirica (Jan.\n10, 2010), Exh. 8, p. 4, Supp. App. to Response for Perry\net al. (hereinafter Supp. App. to Response). Subsequently,\na committee of judges was created to study the matter.\nAnd on December 17, 2009, the Circuit Council voted to\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

And it\nissued a press release. News Release, Ninth Circuit Judi\ncial Council Approves Experimental Use of Cameras in\nDistrict Courts (Dec. 17, 2009), Exh, 13. App. to Pet.\n  In this context the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California amended its local rules on\nDecember 22, 2009 to bring them into conformity with\nNinth Circuit policy. In particular, the court amended the\nlocal Rule forbidding the public broadcasting or televising\nof court proceedings by creating an exception \u201cfor partici\npation in a pilot or other project authorized by the Judicial\nCouncil of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Public Notice Concerning\nRevisions of Civil Local Rule 77\u20133, id., Exh. 14. The court\ninitially relied on a provision in the United States Code\nthat permits District Courts to prescribe rules \u201cwithout\npublic notice and opportunity for comment\u201d \u201c[i]f the pre\nscribing court determines that there is an immediate need\nfor a rule,\u201d and if the court \u201cpromptly thereafter afford[s]\nsuch notice and opportunity for comment,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\n2071(e). See Exh. 1, at 11, Supp. App. to Response. Then,\non December 31, the court revised its public notice to ask\nfor comments directly. By January 8, 2010, the court had\nreceived 138,574 comments, all but 32 of which favored\ntransmitting the proceedings. Id., at 12.\n  Viewed in light of this history, the court satisfied the\nstatute\u2019s insistence that \u201cnotice\u201d be \u201cappropriate.\u201d Cf. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72071(b), (e). The parties, the judges, and the\ninterested public were aware of the proposals to change\nNinth Circuit policy that culminated in the \u201cpilot pro\ngram\u201d well before the change in the local rules that en\nabled participation in the project. The Ninth Circuit\nissued a press release in mid-December explaining its new\n4               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cpilot program.\u201d Then, once the District Court amended\nits local rule, it issued its own notice nearly three weeks\nbefore the transmissions that the rule change authorized\nwere to begin. And the rule change itself is simply a\nchange that conforms local rule to Circuit policy\u2014a con\nformity that the law may well require. (The Judicial\nCouncil had long before voted to make its video policy\n\u201cbinding on all courts within the Ninth Circuit,\u201d Letter\nfrom Chief Judge Hug to All Ninth Circuit Judges (June\n21, 1996) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); it an\nnounced its new \u201cpilot program\u201d policy in December 2009,\nApp. to Application, Exh. 13, App. to Pet.; and federal\nstatutes render district court rules void insofar as they\nhave been \u201cmodified or abrogated\u201d by the Council, see\n\u00a72071(c)(1). Compare ante, at 11 (\u201cCouncil only has the\npower to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with\nfederal law\u201d), with 28 U. S. C. \u00a7332(d)(1) (\u201c[C]ouncil shall\nmake all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective\nand expeditious administration of justice within its cir\ncuit\u201d).) The applicants point to no interested person un\naware of the change. How can the Majority reasonably\ndemand yet more notice in respect to a local rule modifica\ntion that a statute likely requires regardless?\n   There was also sufficient \u201copportunity for comment.\u201d\nThe parties, the intervenors, other judges, the public\u2014all\nhad an opportunity to comment. The parties were specifi\ncally invited by Chief Judge Walker to comment on the\npossibility of broadcast as early as September. And the\nentire public was invited by the District Court to submit\ncomments after the rule change was announced, right up\nto the eve of trial. As I said, the court received 138,574\ncomments during that time. How much more \u201copportunity\nfor comment\u201d does the Court believe necessary, particu\nlarly when the statutes themselves authorize the local\ncourt to put a new rule into effect \u201cwithout\u201d receiving any\n\u201ccomments\u201d before doing so when that local \u201ccourt deter\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmines that there is an immediate need\u201d to do so (and to\nreceive comments later)? And more importantly, what is\nthe legal source of the Court\u2019s demand for additional\ncomment time in respect to a rule change to conform to\nJudicial Council policy?\n   Second, this legal question is not the kind of legal ques\ntion that this Court would normally grant certiorari to\nconsider. There is no conflict among the state or federal\ncourts regarding the procedures by which a district court\nchanges its local rules. Cf. this Court\u2019s Rules 10(a)\u2013(b).\nThe technical validity of the procedures followed below\ndoes not implicate an open \u201cimportant question of federal\nlaw.\u201d Cf. Rule 10(c). Nor do the procedures below clearly\nconflict with any precedent from this Court. Cf. ibid.\n   It is particularly inadvisable for this Court to consider\nthis kind of question because it involves local rules and\nlocal judicial administration. Here, for example, the Court\ndecides just how a district court should modify its own\nlocal rules; in a word, this Court micromanages district\ncourt administrative procedures in the most detailed way.\nAnd, without briefing, the Court imposes limitations on\nthe Judicial Councils\u2019 ability to implement policy deci\nsions, ante, at 11\u201312 (suggesting Council policy does not\nabrogate local rules), with consequences we cannot pre\ndict. The District Councils, the Circuit Councils, the\nJudicial Conference of the United States, and the Chief\nJustice bear responsibility for judicial administration, not\nthis Court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7331\u2013332. And those bodies\nhave adequate authority to resolve disagreements about\nhow to promulgate and apply local rules, and, particularly,\nabout the use of cameras in the courtroom.\n   For the past 80 years, local judicial administration has\nbeen left to the exclusive province of the Circuit Judicial\nCouncils, and this Court lacks their institutional experi\nence. See generally P. Fish, The Politics of Federal Judi\ncial Administration 152\u2013153 (1973) (From their creation,\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201c[t]he councils constituted . . . a mechanism through which\nthere could be a concentration of responsibility in the\nvarious Circuits\u2014immediate responsibility for the work of\nthe courts, with power and authority . . . to insure compe\ntence in th[eir] work . . .\u201d). For that reason it is inappro\npriate as well as unnecessary for this Court to intervene in\nthe procedural aspects of local judicial administration.\nPerhaps that is why I have not been able to find any other\ncase in which this Court has previously done so, through\nemergency relief or otherwise. Cf. Bank of Nova Scotia v.\nUnited States, 487 U. S. 250, 264 (1988) (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (\u201cI do not see the basis for any direct authority to\nsupervise lower courts\u201d (citing Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S.\n641, 651\u2013652 (1987) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting))). Nor\nam I aware of any instance in which this Court has pre\nemptively sought to micromanage district court proceed\nings as it does today.\n   I recognize that the Court may see this matter not as\none of promulgating and applying a local rule but, rather,\nas presenting the larger question of the place of cameras\nin the courtroom. But the wisdom of a camera policy is\nprimarily a matter for the proper administrative bodies to\ndetermine. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7332. This Court has no legal\nauthority to address that larger policy question except\ninsofar as it implicates a question of law. The relevant\nquestion of law here concerns the procedure for amending\nlocal rules. And the only relevant legal principles that\nallow us here to take account of the immediate subject\nmatter of that local rule, namely cameras, are those legal\nprinciples that permit us\u2014indeed require us\u2014to look to\nthe nature of the harm at issue and to balance equities,\nincluding the public interest. I consequently turn to those\ntwo matters.\n   Third, consider the harm: I can find no basis for the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that, were the transmissions to other\ncourtrooms to take place, the applicants would suffer\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nirreparable harm. Certainly there is no evidence that\nsuch harm could arise in this nonjury civil case from the\nsimple fact of transmission itself. By my count, 42 States\nand two Federal District Courts currently give judges the\ndiscretion to broadcast civil nonjury trials. See Media\nPrivacy and Related Law 2009\u201310 (2009) (collecting state\nstatutes and rules); Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule\n1.8 (EDNY 2009). Neither the applicants nor anyone else\n\u201chas been able to present empirical data sufficient to\nestablish that the mere presence of the broadcast media\ninherently has an adverse effect on [the judicial] process,\u201d\nChandler v. Florida, 449 U. S. 560, 578\u2013579 (1981). Cf. M.\nCohn & D. Dow, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television\nand the Pursuit of Justice 62\u201364 (1998) (canvassing stud\nies, none of which found harm, and one of which found\nthat witnesses \u201cwho faced an obvious camera, provided\nanswers that were more correct, lengthier and more de\ntailed\u201d). And, in any event, any harm to the parties, in\ncluding the applicants, is reparable through appeal. Cf.\nChandler, supra, at 581.\n   The applicants also claim that the transmission will\nirreparably harm the witnesses themselves, presumably\nby increasing the public\u2019s awareness of who those wit\nnesses are. And they claim that some members of the\npublic might harass those witnesses. But the witnesses,\nalthough capable of doing so, have not asked this Court to\nset aside the District Court\u2019s order. Cf. Miller v. Albright,\n523 U. S. 420, 445 (1998) (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Powers v. Ohio,\n499 U. S. 400, 411 (1991). And that is not surprising. All\nof the witnesses supporting the applicants are already\npublicly identified with their cause. They are all experts\nor advocates who have either already appeared on televi\nsion or Internet broadcasts, already toured the State\nadvocating a \u201cyes\u201d vote on Proposition 8, or already en\ngaged in extensive public commentary far more likely to\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmake them well known than a closed-circuit broadcast to\nanother federal courthouse.\n   The likelihood of any \u201cirreparable\u201d harm is further\ndiminished by the fact that the court order before us\nwould simply increase the trial\u2019s viewing audience from\nthe occupants of one courtroom in one courthouse to the\noccupants of five other courtrooms in five other court\nhouses (in all of which taking pictures or retransmissions\nhave been forbidden). By way of comparison literally\nhundreds of national and international newspapers are\nalready covering this trial and reporting in detail the\nnames and testimony of all of the witnesses. See, e.g.,\nLeff, Woman Recalls Emotional Ordeal of Gay Marriage\nBan, Associated Press, Jan. 11, 2010. I see no reason why\nthe incremental increase in exposure caused by transmit\nting these proceedings to five additional courtrooms would\ncreate any further risk of harm, as the Court apparently\nbelieves. See ante, at 13. Moreover, if in respect to any\nparticular witness this transmission threatens harm, the\nDistrict Court can prevent that harm. Chief Judge\nWalker has already said that he would keep the broadcast\n\u201ccompletely under the Court\u2019s control, to permit the Court\nto stop it if [it] proves to be a problem, if it proves to be a\ndistraction, [or] if it proves to create problems with wit\nnesses.\u201d See Exh. 2, at 45, App. to Pet. The Circuit Coun\ncil confirmed in a press release that the District Court\n\u201cwill fully control the process\u201d and that \u201cJudge Walker has\nreserved the right to terminate any part of the audio\nor video, or both, for any duration\u201d or to terminate par\nticipation in the pilot program \u201cat any time.\u201d News\nRelease, Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote Viewing\nof Pro-position 8 Trial (Jan. 8, 2010), http://www.\nca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/Prop8_\nRemote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2010,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).

Schulingkamp,\n419 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1974) (Powell, J. in Chambers)\n(recognizing \u201csignificant public and private interests\nbalanced on both sides\u201d when \u201cpresent[ed with] a funda\nmental confrontation between the competing values of free\npress and fair trial\u201d). As I have just explained, the appli\ncants\u2019 equities consist of potential harm to witnesses\u2014\nharm that is either nonexistent or that can be cured\nthrough protective measures by the District Court as the\ncircumstances warrant. The competing equities consist of\nnot only respondents\u2019 interest in obtaining the courthouse\nto-courthouse transmission that they desire, but also the\npublic\u2019s interest in observing trial proceedings to learn\nabout this case and about how courts work. See Nebraska\nPress Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 587 (1976) (Brennan,\nJ., concurring in judgment); see also Exh. 2, at 42, App. to\nPet. (statement of Chief Judge Walker) (\u201c[I]f the public\ncould see how the judicial process works, they would take\na somewhat different view of it.\u201d \u201cI think the only time\nthat you\u2019re going to draw sufficient interest in the legal\nprocess is when you have an issue such as the issues here,\nthat people think about, talk about, debate about and\nconsider\u201d). With these considerations in the balance, the\nscales tip heavily against, not in favor, of issuing the stay.\n   The majority\u2019s action today is unusual. It grants a stay\nin order to consider a mandamus petition, with a view to\nintervening in a matter of local court administration that\nit would not (and should not) consider. It cites no prece\ndent for doing so. It identifies no real harm, let alone\n\u201cirreparable harm,\u201d to justify its issuance of this stay.\nAnd the public interest weighs in favor of providing access\n10              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the courts. To justify this extraordinary intervention,\nthe majority insists that courts must \u201cenforce the re\nquirement of procedural regularity on others, and must\nfollow those requirements themselves.\u201d Ante, at 1. And so\ntoo I believe this Court should adhere to its institutional\ncompetence, its historical practice, and its governing\nprecedent\u2014all of which counsel strongly against the issu\nance of this stay.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

We\nresolve that question without expressing any view on\nwhether such trials should be broadcast. We instead\ndetermine that the broadcast in this case should be stayed\nbecause it appears the courts below did not follow the\nappropriate procedures set forth in federal law before\nchanging their rules to allow such broadcasting. Courts\nenforce the requirement of procedural regularity on oth\ners, and must follow those requirements themselves.\n                         *    *     *\n   This lawsuit, still in a preliminary stage, involves an\naction challenging what the parties refer to as Proposition\n8, a California ballot proposition adopted by the electorate.\nProposition 8 amended the State Constitution by adding a\nnew section providing that \u201c[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\u201d\nCal. Const. Art. I, \u00a77.5. The plaintiffs contend that Propo\nsition 8 violates the United States Constitution. A bench\ntrial in the case began on Monday, January 11, 2010, in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District\nof California.\n   The District Court has issued an order permitting the\ntrial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to\na number of federal courthouses around the country. The\n2                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\norder was issued pursuant to a purported amendment to a\nlocal Rule of the District Court. That Rule had previously\nforbidden the broadcasting of trials outside the courthouse\nin which a trial takes place. The District Court effected its\namendment via several postings on the District Court\u2019s\nWeb site in the days immediately before the trial in this\ncase was to begin.\n  Applicants here are defendant-intervenors in the law\nsuit. They object to the District Court\u2019s order, arguing\nthat the District Court violated a federal statute by prom\nulgating the amendment to its local Rule without suffi\ncient opportunity for notice and comment and that the\npublic broadcast would violate their due process rights to a\nfair and impartial trial. Applicants seek a stay of the\norder pending the filing of petitions for writs of certiorari\nand mandamus. We granted a temporary stay to consider\nthe issue further. Post, p. ___. Concluding that the appli\ncants have made a sufficient showing of entitlement to\nrelief, we now grant a stay.\n                              I\n  Proposition 8 was passed by California voters in No\nvember 2008. It was a ballot proposition designed to\noverturn a ruling by the California Supreme Court that\nhad given same-sex couples a right to marry. Proposition\n8 was and is the subject of public debate throughout the\nState and, indeed, nationwide. Its advocates claim that\nthey have been subject to harassment as a result of public\ndisclosure of their support. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Ap\npellant 28\u201329 in Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm\u2019n, No. 08\u2013205, now pending before this Court.

Opponents of\nProposition 8 also are alleged to have compiled \u201cInternet\nblacklists\u201d of pro-Proposition 8 businesses and urged\nothers to boycott those businesses in retaliation for sup\nporting the ballot measure. Carlton, Gay Activists Boycott\nBackers of Prop 8, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 27, 2008, A3.\nAnd numerous instances of vandalism and physical vio\nlence have been reported against those who have been\nidentified as Proposition 8 supporters. See Exhs. B, I, and\nL to Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion for Protective Order in\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, No. 3:09\u2013cv\u201302292 (ND Cal.)\n(hereinafter Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion).\n   Respondents filed suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, seeking to\ninvalidate Proposition 8. They contend that the amend\nment to the State\u2019s Constitution violates the Equal Protec\ntion and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amend\nment of the United States Constitution. The State of\nCalifornia declined to defend Proposition 8, and the defen\ndant-intervenors (who are the applicants here) entered the\nsuit to defend its constitutionality. A bench trial began on\nMonday, January 11, 2010, before the Chief Judge of the\nDistrict Court, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker.\n   On September 25, 2009, the District Court informed the\nparties at a hearing that there was interest in the possibil\nity that the trial would be broadcast. Respondents indi\ncated their support for the idea, while applicants opposed\nit. The court noted that \u201c[t]here are, of course, Judicial\nConference positions on this,\u201d but also that \u201c[t]his is all in\nflux.\u201d Exh. 9, p. 72, App. to Pet. for Mandamus in No. 10\u2013\n4               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n70063 (CA9) (hereinafter App. to Pet.).\n   One month later, Chief Judge Kozinski of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appointed a\nthree-judge committee to evaluate the possibility of adopt\ning a Ninth Circuit Rule regarding the recording and\ntransmission of district court proceedings. The committee\n(of which Chief Judge Walker was a member) recom\nmended to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council that district\ncourts be permitted to experiment with broadcasting court\nproceedings on a trial basis. Chief Judge Walker later\nacknowledged that while the committee was considering\nthe pilot program, \u201cthis case was very much in mind at\nthat time because it had come to prominence then and was\nthought to be an ideal candidate for consideration.\u201d Id.,\nExh. 2, at 42. The committee did not publicly disclose its\nconsideration of the proposal, nor did it solicit or receive\npublic comments on the proposal.\n   On December 17, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council\nissued a news release indicating that it had approved a\npilot program for \u201cthe limited use of cameras in federal\ndistrict courts within the circuit.\u201d Id., Exh. 13, at 1. The\nrelease explained that the Council\u2019s decision \u201camend[ed] a\n1996 Ninth Circuit policy\u201d that had banned the photo\ngraphing, as well as radio and television coverage, of court\nproceedings. Ibid. The release further indicated that\ncases would be selected for participation in the program\n\u201cby the chief judge of the district court in consultation\nwith the chief circuit judge.\u201d Ibid. No further guidelines\nfor participation in the pilot program have since been\nissued.\n   On December 21, a coalition of media companies re\nquested permission from the District Court to televise the\ntrial challenging Proposition 8. Two days later, the court\nindicated on its Web site that it had amended Civil Local\nRule 77\u20133, which had previously banned the recording or\nbroadcast of court proceedings. The revised version of\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nRule 77\u20133 created an exception to this general prohibition\nto allow \u201cfor participation in a pilot or other project au\nthorized by the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Id.,\nExh. 14. Applicants objected to the revision, arguing that\nany change to Ninth Circuit or local rules would require a\nsufficient notice and comment period.\n   On December 31, the District Court revised its Web site\nto remove the previous announcement about the change to\nRule 77\u20133. A new announcement was posted indicating a\n\u201cproposed revision of Civil Local Rule 77\u20133,\u201d which had\nbeen \u201capproved for public comment.\u201d Id., Exh. 17. The\nproposed revision was the same as the previously an\nnounced amendment. Comments on the proposed revision\nwere to be submitted by Friday, January 8, 2010.\n   On January 4, 2010, the District Court again revised its\nWeb site. The announcement regarding the proposed\nrevision of Rule 77\u20133 was removed and replaced with a\nthird version of the announcement. This third version\nstated that the revised Rule was \u201ceffective December 22,\n2009,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he revised rule was adopted pursuant\nto the \u2018immediate need\u2019 provision of Title 28 Section\n2071(e).\u201d Id., Exh. 19, at 3.\n   On January 6, 2010, the District Court held a hearing\nregarding the recording and broadcasting of the upcoming\ntrial. The court announced that an audio and video feed of\ntrial proceedings would be streamed live to certain court\nhouses in other cities. It also announced that, pending\napproval of the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, the trial\nwould be recorded and then broadcast on the Internet. A\ncourt technician explained that the proceedings would be\nrecorded by three cameras, and then the resulting broad\ncast would be uploaded for posting on the Internet, with a\ndelay due to processing requirements.\n   On January 7, 2010, the District Court filed an order\nformally requesting that Chief Judge Kozinski approve\n\u201cinclusion of the trial in the pilot project on the terms and\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconditions discussed at the January 6, 2010, hearing and\nsubject to resolution of certain technical issues.\u201d Id., Exh.\n1, at 2. Applicants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus\nin the Court of Appeals, seeking to prohibit or stay the\nDistrict Court from enforcing its order. The following day,\na three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals denied the\npetition.\n   On January 8, 2010, Chief Judge Kozinski issued an\norder approving the District Court\u2019s decision to allow real\ntime streaming of the trial to certain federal courthouses\nlisted in a simultaneously issued press release. Five\nlocations had been selected: federal courthouses in San\nFrancisco, Pasadena, Seattle, Portland, and Brooklyn.\nThe press release also indicated that \u201c[a]dditional sites\nmay be announced.\u201d Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote\nViewing       of   Proposition     8    Trial,    online   at\nhttp://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/\nProp8_Remote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13,\n2010, and available in the Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   Chief Judge Kozinski\u2019s January 8 order noted that the\nrequest to broadcast the trial on the Internet was \u201cstill\npending\u201d before him. In a later letter to Chief Judge\nWalker, he explained that the request was not yet \u201cripe for\napproval\u201d because \u201cthe technical staff encountered some\nunexpected difficulties preparing a satisfactory video\nsuitable for on-line posting.\u201d Letter of Jan. 9, 2010 (avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A final decision whether\nto permit online publication would be made when techni\ncal difficulties were resolved.\n   On January 9, 2010, applicants filed in this Court an\napplication for a stay of the District Court\u2019s order. Their\npetition seeks a stay pending resolution of forthcoming\npetitions for the writs of certiorari and mandamus.\n                            II\n    The question whether courtroom proceedings should be\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nbroadcast has prompted considerable national debate.\nReasonable minds differ on the proper resolution of that\ndebate and on the restrictions, circumstances, and proce\ndures under which such broadcasts should occur. We do\nnot here express any views on the propriety of broadcast\ning court proceedings generally.\n  Instead, our review is confined to a narrow legal issue:\nwhether the District Court\u2019s amendment of its local rules\nto broadcast this trial complied with federal law. We\nconclude that it likely did not and that applicants have\ndemonstrated that irreparable harm would likely result\nfrom the District Court\u2019s actions. We therefore stay the\ncourt\u2019s January 7, 2010, order to the extent that it permits\nthe live streaming of court proceedings to other federal\ncourthouses. We do not address other aspects of that\norder, such as those related to the broadcast of court pro\nceedings on the Internet, as this may be premature.\n                              A\n   To obtain a stay pending the filing and disposition of a\npetition for a writ of certiorari, an applicant must show\n(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider\nthe issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a\nfair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to\nreverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that\nirreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay. In\nclose cases the Circuit Justice or the Court will balance\nthe equities and weigh the relative harms to the applicant\nand to the respondent. Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S.\n1301, 1304 (1988) (KENNEDY, J., in chambers); Rostker v.\nGoldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in\nchambers). To obtain a stay pending the filing and dispo\nsition of a petition for a writ of mandamus, an applicant\nmust show a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will\nvote to grant mandamus and a likelihood that irreparable\nharm will result from the denial of a stay.

United States Dist. Court\nfor D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380\u2013381 (2004) (some internal\nquotation marks omitted). This Court will issue the writ\nof mandamus directly to a federal district court \u201conly\nwhere a question of public importance is involved, or\nwhere the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly\nappropriate that such action by this court should be\ntaken.\u201d Ex parte United States, 287 U. S. 241, 248\u2013249\n(1932). These familiar standards are followed here, where\napplicants claim that the District Court\u2019s order was based\non a local rule adopted in violation of federal law.\n                               B\n   Given the importance of the issues at stake, and our\nconclusion that the District Court likely violated a federal\nstatute in revising its local rules, applicants have shown a\nfair prospect that a majority of this Court will either grant\na petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the order\nbelow or will grant a petition for a writ of mandamus.\n   A district court has discretion to adopt local rules.\nFrazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, 645 (1987) (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 83). Those rules have\n\u201cthe force of law.\u201d Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 169\n(1929). Federal law, however, requires a district court to\nfollow certain procedures to adopt or amend a local rule.\nLocal rules typically may not be amended unless the\ndistrict court \u201cgiv[es] appropriate public notice and an\nopportunity for comment.\u201d 28 U.

Electronic transmittal of courtroom pro\n    ceedings and presentation of evidence within the con\n    fines of the courthouse is permitted, if authorized by\n    the Judge or Magistrate Judge. The term \u2018environs,\u2019\n    as used in this rule, means all floors on which cham\n    bers, courtrooms or on which Offices of the Clerk are\n    located, with the exception of any space specifically\n    designated as a Press Room. Nothing in this rule is\n    intended to restrict the use of electronic means to re\n    ceive or present evidence during Court proceedings.\u201d\nNotably, the Rule excepted from its general ban the trans\nmittal of certain proceedings\u2014but it limited that exception\nto transmissions \u201cwithin the confines of the courthouse.\u201d\nThe negative inference of this exception, of course, is that\nthe Rule would have prohibited the streaming of trans\nmissions, or other broadcasting or televising, beyond \u201cthe\nconfines of the courthouse.\u201d\n   Respondents do not dispute that this version of Rule 77\u2013\n3 would have prohibited streaming video of the trial\naround the country. But they assert that this is not the\noperative version of Rule 77\u20133. In a series of postings on\nits Web site, the District Court purported to revise or\npropose revisions to Local Rule 77\u20133. This amendment\nwould have created an additional exception to Rule 77\u20133\u2019s\n10               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ngeneral ban on the broadcasting of court proceedings \u201cfor\nparticipation in a pilot or other project authorized by the\nJudicial Council of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Exh. 14, App. to\nPet. Respondents rely on this amended version of the\nRule.\n   The amended version of Rule 77\u20133 appears to be invalid.\nIn amending this rule, it appears that the District Court\nfailed to \u201cgiv[e] appropriate public notice and an opportu\nnity for comment,\u201d as required by federal law. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72071(b). The first time the District Court asked for pub\nlic comments was on the afternoon of New Year\u2019s Eve.\nThe court stated that it would leave the comment period\nopen until January 8. At most, the District Court there\nfore allowed a comment period spanning five business\ndays. There is substantial merit to the argument that this\nwas not \u201cappropriate\u201d notice and an opportunity for com\nment. Administrative agencies, for instance, \u201cusually\u201d\nprovide a comment period of \u201cthirty days or more.\u201d River\nbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F. 2d 1479, 1484 (CA9\n1992); see Petry v. Block, 737 F. 2d 1193, 1201 (CADC\n1984) (\u201c[T]he shortest period in which parties can mean\ningfully review a proposed rule and file informed re\nsponses is thirty days\u201d).\n   To be sure, the possibility that some aspects of the trial\nmight be broadcast was first raised to the parties by the\nDistrict Court at an in-court hearing on September 25,\nsome three months before the Rule was changed. The\nbroadcasting, however, was prohibited under both Circuit\nand local rules at that time. The first public indication\nthat the District Court intended to adopt a rule of general\napplicability came in its Web site posting on December 23.\nAnd even if Chief Judge Walker\u2019s in-court allusion to the\npossibility that the Proposition 8 trial might be broadcast\ncould be considered as providing notice to the parties in\nthis case\u2014his statement that \u201c[t]his is all in flux\u201d notwith\nstanding\u2014the disclosure falls far short of the \u201cappropriate\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npublic notice and an opportunity for comment\u201d required by\n\u00a72071(b). Indeed, there was no proposed policy on which\nto comment.\n   The need for a meaningful comment period was particu\nlarly acute in this case. Both courts and legislatures have\nproceeded with appropriate caution in addressing this\nquestion. In 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United\nStates adopted a policy opposing the public broadcast of\ncourt proceedings. This policy was adopted after a multi\nyear study of the issue by the Federal Judicial Center\nwhich drew on data from six district and two appellate\ncourts, as well as state-court data. In light of the study\u2019s\nfindings, the Judicial Conference concluded that \u201cthe\nintimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and\njurors [is] cause for concern.\u201d Report of the Proceedings of\nthe Judicial Conference of the United States 47 (Sept. 20,\n1994).\n   In more than a decade since its adoption the Judicial\nConference has continued to adhere to its position on the\nbroadcast of court proceedings. While the policy conclu\nsions of the Judicial Conference may not be binding on the\nlower courts, they are \u201cat the very least entitled to respect\nful consideration.\u201d In re Sony BMG Music Entertainment,\n564 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2009). Before abandoning its own\npolicy\u2014one consistent with the Judicial Conference\u2019s\nlongstanding views\u2014it was incumbent on the District\nCourt to adopt a proposed rule only after notice and an\nadequate period for public comment.\n   In dispensing with public notice and comment the Dis\ntrict Court invoked the \u201cimmediate need\u201d exception. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071(e). It did so through a Web site posting on\nJanuary 4\u2014prior to the expiration of the comment pe\nriod\u2014indicating that Rule 77\u20133 had been revised to per\nmit participation in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s pilot program.\nThese postings gave no explanation for invoking the ex\nception. At trial the District Court explained that the\n12              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nimmediate need here was to allow this case to be broad\ncast pursuant to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s new pilot program.\nSee Exh. 1, p. 11, Supp. App. to Response for Perry et al.\n   This does not qualify as an immediate need that justi\nfies dispensing with the notice and comment procedures\nrequired by federal law. While respondents (the plaintiffs\nin the District Court) had indicated their approval of the\nplan, no party alleged that it would be imminently harmed\nif the trial were not broadcast. Had an administrative\nagency acted as the District Court did here, the immediate\nneed exception would likely not have been available. See\n5 U. S. C. \u00a7553(b)(B) (administrative agencies cannot\ninvoke an exception to affording notice-and-comment\nbefore rulemaking unless the notice-and-comment proce\ndures would be \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to\nthe public interest\u201d). In issuing its order the District\nCourt relied on the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council\u2019s pilot\nprogram. Yet nothing in that program\u2014which was not\nadopted after notice and comment procedures, cf. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7332(d)(1)\u2014required any \u201cimmediate\u201d revision in\nlocal rules. The Ninth Circuit Judicial Council did not\npurport to modify or abrogate the District Court\u2019s local\nRule. Nor could it, as the Judicial Council only has the\npower to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with\nfederal law. See \u00a7332(d)(4) (permitting a circuit court\ncouncil to modify a local rule that is \u201cfound inconsistent\u201d\nwith rules promulgated by the Supreme Court). No fed\neral law requires that the District Court broadcast some of\nits cases. The District Court\u2019s local Rule, in addition, was\nnot a conforming amendment to Ninth Circuit policy,\nbecause that policy does not require district courts to\nbroadcast proceedings.\n   Applicants also have shown that irreparable harm will\nlikely result from the denial of the stay. Without a stay,\nthe District Court will broadcast the trial. It would be\ndifficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to reverse the harm from\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthose broadcasts. The trial will involve various witnesses,\nincluding members of same-sex couples; academics, who\napparently will discuss gender issues and gender equality,\nas well as family structures; and those who participated in\nthe campaign leading to the adoption of Proposition 8.\nThis Court has recognized that witness testimony may be\nchilled if broadcast. See Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 547\n(1965); id., at 591 (Harlan, J., concurring). Some of appli\ncants\u2019 witnesses have already said that they will not tes\ntify if the trial is broadcast, and they have substantiated\ntheir concerns by citing incidents of past harassment. See,\ne.g., Exh. K to Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Motion (71 news\narticles detailing incidents of harassment related to people\nwho supported Proposition 8). These concerns are not\ndiminished by the fact that some of applicants\u2019 witnesses\nare compensated expert witnesses. There are qualitative\ndifferences between making public appearances regarding\nan issue and having one\u2019s testimony broadcast throughout\nthe country. Applicants may not be able to obtain ade\nquate relief through an appeal. The trial will have already\nbeen broadcast. It is difficult to demonstrate or analyze\nwhether a witness would have testified differently if his or\nher testimony had not been broadcast. And witnesses\nsubject to harassment as a result of broadcast of their\ntestimony might be less likely to cooperate in any future\nproceedings.\n   The balance of equities favors applicants. While appli\ncants have demonstrated the threat of harm they face if\nthe trial is broadcast, respondents have not alleged any\nharm if the trial is not broadcast. The issue, moreover,\nmust be resolved at this stage, for the injury likely cannot\nbe undone once the broadcast takes place.\n   This Court also has a significant interest in supervising\nthe administration of the judicial system. See this Court\u2019s\nRule 10(a) (the Court will consider whether the courts\nbelow have \u201cso far departed from the accepted and usual\n14               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncourse of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise\nof this Court\u2019s supervisory power\u201d). The Court may use its\nsupervisory authority to invalidate local rules that were\npromulgated in violation of an Act of Congress. See Fra\nzier, 482 U. S., at 645\u2013646; id., at 652, 654 (Rehnquist,\nC. J., dissenting). The Court\u2019s interest in ensuring com\npliance with proper rules of judicial administration is\nparticularly acute when those rules relate to the integrity\nof judicial processes. The District Court here attempted to\nrevise its rules in haste, contrary to federal statutes and\nthe policy of the Judicial Conference of the United States.\nIt did so to allow broadcasting of this high-profile trial\nwithout any considered standards or guidelines in place.\nThe arguments in favor of developing procedures and rules\nto allow broadcast of certain cases have considerable\nmerit, and reasonable minds can surely differ over the\ngeneral and specific terms of rules and standards adopted\nfor that purpose. Here, however, the order in question\ncomplied neither with existing rules or policies nor the\nrequired procedures for amending them.\n   By insisting that courts comply with the law, parties\nvindicate not only the rights they assert but also the law\u2019s\nown insistence on neutrality and fidelity to principle.\nThose systematic interests are all the more evident here,\nwhere the lack of a regular rule with proper standards to\ndetermine the guidelines for broadcasting could compro\nmise the orderly, decorous, rational traditions that courts\nrely upon to ensure the integrity of their own judgments.\nThese considerations, too, are part of the reasons leading\nto the decision to grant extraordinary relief.\n   In addressing a discrete instance authorizing a closed\ncircuit broadcast of a trial, Congress has illustrated the\nneed for careful guidelines and standards. The trial of the\ntwo defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case had\nbeen transferred to the United States District Court for\nthe District of Colorado, so it was set to take place in\n                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nDenver. That meant the families of deceased and surviv\ning victims in and around Oklahoma City would not have\nthe opportunity to observe the trial. Congress passed a\nstatute that allowed victims\u2019 families to watch the trial on\nclosed-circuit television. 42 U. S. C. \u00a710608. The statute\nwas drawn with care to provide precise and detailed guid\nance with respect to the wide range of issues implicated by\nthe broadcast. See \u00a710608(a) (the statute only applies \u201cin\ncases where the venue of the trial is changed\u201d to a city\nthat is \u201cout of the State\u201d and \u201cmore than 350 miles from\nthe location in which those proceedings originally would\nhave taken place\u201d); \u00a7\u00a710608(a)\u2013(b) (standards for who can\nview such trials); \u00a710608(c) (restrictions on transmission).\nAnd the statute gave the Judicial Conference of the United\nStates rulemaking authority \u201cto effectuate the policy\naddressed by this section.\u201d \u00a710608(g). In the present case,\nby contrast, over a span of three weeks the District Court\nand Ninth Circuit Judicial Council issued, retracted, and\nreissued a series of Web site postings and news releases.\nThese purport to amend rules and policies at the heart of\nan ongoing consideration of broadcasting federal trials.\nAnd they have done so to make sure that one particular\ntrial may be broadcast. Congress\u2019 requirement of a notice\nand comment procedure prevents just such arbitrary\nchanges of court rules. Instead, courts must use the pro\ncedures prescribed by statute to amend their rules, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72071.\n   If Local Rule 77\u20133 had been validly revised, questions\nwould still remain about the District Court\u2019s decision to\nallow broadcasting of this particular trial, in which several\nof the witnesses have stated concerns for their own secu\nrity. Even districts that allow trials to be broadcast, see\nCiv. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule 1.8 (EDNY 2009),\nrecognize that a district judge\u2019s discretion to broadcast a\ntrial is limited, see, e.g., Hamilton v.

See Sony BMG,\n564 F. 3d, at 11 (Lipez, J., concurring) (distinguishing\nbroadcast of attorneys\u2019 arguments from other parts of the\ntrial). This case is therefore not a good one for a pilot\nprogram. Even the studies that have been conducted thus\nfar have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high\nprofile, divisive cases. See Application for Stay 17 (warn\ning by Judge Edward R. Becker that in \u201c \u2018truly high-profile\ncases,\u2019 \u201d one can \u201c \u2018[j]ust imagine what the findings would\nbe\u2019 \u201d (quoting Exh. 21, at 2, App. to Pet.)).\n                            III\n   The District Court attempted to change its rules at the\neleventh hour to treat this case differently than other\ntrials in the district.

See ante, at 6\u20137;\nRostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S., 1306, 1308 (1980) (Bren\nnan, J., in chambers) (stay standard); Cheney v. United\nStates Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004)\n(noting that mandamus is a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary\nremedy reserved for really extraordinary causes\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This case, in my view, does not\nsatisfy a single one of these standards, let alone all of\nthem. Consequently, I must dissent.\n  First, consider the merits of the legal issue: The United\nStates Code, in a chapter entitled \u201cRules of Courts,\u201d states\n2               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat \u201c[a]ny rule . . . shall be prescribed only after giving\nappropriate public notice and an opportunity for com\nment.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72071(b). The question here is whether\nthe District Court accompanied the modification of its\nantivideo rule with \u201cappropriate public notice and an\nopportunity for comment.\u201d\n  Certainly the parties themselves had more than ade\nquate notice and opportunity to comment before the Rule\nwas changed. On September 25, 2009, the trial judge,\nChief Judge Vaughn Walker, discussed the possibility of\nbroadcasting trial proceedings both within the courthouse\nand beyond, and asked for the parties\u2019 views. No party\nobjected to the presence of cameras in the courtroom for\ntransmissions within the courthouse, Exh. 9, p. 70, App. to\nPet. for Mandamus in No. 10\u201370063 (CA9) (hereinafter\nApp. to Pet.). (\u201cNo objection. None at all\u201d), and both sides\nmade written submissions to the court regarding their\nviews on other transmissions. The court again raised the\nissue at a hearing on December 16.\n  Nor, in practice, did other members of the Judiciary lack\ninformation about the issue. In May 1996 the Circuit\nCouncil adopted a policy permitting video in connection\nwith appellate proceedings, but prohibiting its use in the\ndistrict court. Subsequently, appellate court panels have\nfrequently permitted electronic coverage. Judges, the\npress, lawyers, and others have discussed the matter. In\n2007 the lawyers and judges present at the Ninth Circuit\nJudicial Conference considered a resolution that favored\nthe use of cameras in district court civil nonjury proceed\nings. And, voting separately, both lawyers and judges\n\u201capproved the resolution by resounding margins.\u201d Letter\nfrom Chief Judge Kozinski to Judge Anthony Scirica (Jan.\n10, 2010), Exh. 8, p. 4, Supp. App. to Response for Perry\net al. (hereinafter Supp. App. to Response). Subsequently,\na committee of judges was created to study the matter.\nAnd on December 17, 2009, the Circuit Council voted to\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

And it\nissued a press release. News Release, Ninth Circuit Judi\ncial Council Approves Experimental Use of Cameras in\nDistrict Courts (Dec. 17, 2009), Exh, 13. App. to Pet.\n  In this context the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California amended its local rules on\nDecember 22, 2009 to bring them into conformity with\nNinth Circuit policy. In particular, the court amended the\nlocal Rule forbidding the public broadcasting or televising\nof court proceedings by creating an exception \u201cfor partici\npation in a pilot or other project authorized by the Judicial\nCouncil of the Ninth Circuit.\u201d Public Notice Concerning\nRevisions of Civil Local Rule 77\u20133, id., Exh. 14. The court\ninitially relied on a provision in the United States Code\nthat permits District Courts to prescribe rules \u201cwithout\npublic notice and opportunity for comment\u201d \u201c[i]f the pre\nscribing court determines that there is an immediate need\nfor a rule,\u201d and if the court \u201cpromptly thereafter afford[s]\nsuch notice and opportunity for comment,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\n2071(e). See Exh. 1, at 11, Supp. App. to Response. Then,\non December 31, the court revised its public notice to ask\nfor comments directly. By January 8, 2010, the court had\nreceived 138,574 comments, all but 32 of which favored\ntransmitting the proceedings. Id., at 12.\n  Viewed in light of this history, the court satisfied the\nstatute\u2019s insistence that \u201cnotice\u201d be \u201cappropriate.\u201d Cf. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72071(b), (e). The parties, the judges, and the\ninterested public were aware of the proposals to change\nNinth Circuit policy that culminated in the \u201cpilot pro\ngram\u201d well before the change in the local rules that en\nabled participation in the project. The Ninth Circuit\nissued a press release in mid-December explaining its new\n4               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cpilot program.\u201d Then, once the District Court amended\nits local rule, it issued its own notice nearly three weeks\nbefore the transmissions that the rule change authorized\nwere to begin. And the rule change itself is simply a\nchange that conforms local rule to Circuit policy\u2014a con\nformity that the law may well require. (The Judicial\nCouncil had long before voted to make its video policy\n\u201cbinding on all courts within the Ninth Circuit,\u201d Letter\nfrom Chief Judge Hug to All Ninth Circuit Judges (June\n21, 1996) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); it an\nnounced its new \u201cpilot program\u201d policy in December 2009,\nApp. to Application, Exh. 13, App. to Pet.; and federal\nstatutes render district court rules void insofar as they\nhave been \u201cmodified or abrogated\u201d by the Council, see\n\u00a72071(c)(1). Compare ante, at 11 (\u201cCouncil only has the\npower to modify or abrogate local rules that conflict with\nfederal law\u201d), with 28 U. S. C. \u00a7332(d)(1) (\u201c[C]ouncil shall\nmake all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective\nand expeditious administration of justice within its cir\ncuit\u201d).) The applicants point to no interested person un\naware of the change. How can the Majority reasonably\ndemand yet more notice in respect to a local rule modifica\ntion that a statute likely requires regardless?\n   There was also sufficient \u201copportunity for comment.\u201d\nThe parties, the intervenors, other judges, the public\u2014all\nhad an opportunity to comment. The parties were specifi\ncally invited by Chief Judge Walker to comment on the\npossibility of broadcast as early as September. And the\nentire public was invited by the District Court to submit\ncomments after the rule change was announced, right up\nto the eve of trial. As I said, the court received 138,574\ncomments during that time. How much more \u201copportunity\nfor comment\u201d does the Court believe necessary, particu\nlarly when the statutes themselves authorize the local\ncourt to put a new rule into effect \u201cwithout\u201d receiving any\n\u201ccomments\u201d before doing so when that local \u201ccourt deter\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmines that there is an immediate need\u201d to do so (and to\nreceive comments later)? And more importantly, what is\nthe legal source of the Court\u2019s demand for additional\ncomment time in respect to a rule change to conform to\nJudicial Council policy?\n   Second, this legal question is not the kind of legal ques\ntion that this Court would normally grant certiorari to\nconsider. There is no conflict among the state or federal\ncourts regarding the procedures by which a district court\nchanges its local rules. Cf. this Court\u2019s Rules 10(a)\u2013(b).\nThe technical validity of the procedures followed below\ndoes not implicate an open \u201cimportant question of federal\nlaw.\u201d Cf. Rule 10(c). Nor do the procedures below clearly\nconflict with any precedent from this Court. Cf. ibid.\n   It is particularly inadvisable for this Court to consider\nthis kind of question because it involves local rules and\nlocal judicial administration. Here, for example, the Court\ndecides just how a district court should modify its own\nlocal rules; in a word, this Court micromanages district\ncourt administrative procedures in the most detailed way.\nAnd, without briefing, the Court imposes limitations on\nthe Judicial Councils\u2019 ability to implement policy deci\nsions, ante, at 11\u201312 (suggesting Council policy does not\nabrogate local rules), with consequences we cannot pre\ndict. The District Councils, the Circuit Councils, the\nJudicial Conference of the United States, and the Chief\nJustice bear responsibility for judicial administration, not\nthis Court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7331\u2013332. And those bodies\nhave adequate authority to resolve disagreements about\nhow to promulgate and apply local rules, and, particularly,\nabout the use of cameras in the courtroom.\n   For the past 80 years, local judicial administration has\nbeen left to the exclusive province of the Circuit Judicial\nCouncils, and this Court lacks their institutional experi\nence. See generally P. Fish, The Politics of Federal Judi\ncial Administration 152\u2013153 (1973) (From their creation,\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201c[t]he councils constituted . . . a mechanism through which\nthere could be a concentration of responsibility in the\nvarious Circuits\u2014immediate responsibility for the work of\nthe courts, with power and authority . . . to insure compe\ntence in th[eir] work . . .\u201d). For that reason it is inappro\npriate as well as unnecessary for this Court to intervene in\nthe procedural aspects of local judicial administration.\nPerhaps that is why I have not been able to find any other\ncase in which this Court has previously done so, through\nemergency relief or otherwise. Cf. Bank of Nova Scotia v.\nUnited States, 487 U. S. 250, 264 (1988) (SCALIA, J., con\ncurring) (\u201cI do not see the basis for any direct authority to\nsupervise lower courts\u201d (citing Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S.\n641, 651\u2013652 (1987) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting))). Nor\nam I aware of any instance in which this Court has pre\nemptively sought to micromanage district court proceed\nings as it does today.\n   I recognize that the Court may see this matter not as\none of promulgating and applying a local rule but, rather,\nas presenting the larger question of the place of cameras\nin the courtroom. But the wisdom of a camera policy is\nprimarily a matter for the proper administrative bodies to\ndetermine. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7332. This Court has no legal\nauthority to address that larger policy question except\ninsofar as it implicates a question of law. The relevant\nquestion of law here concerns the procedure for amending\nlocal rules. And the only relevant legal principles that\nallow us here to take account of the immediate subject\nmatter of that local rule, namely cameras, are those legal\nprinciples that permit us\u2014indeed require us\u2014to look to\nthe nature of the harm at issue and to balance equities,\nincluding the public interest. I consequently turn to those\ntwo matters.\n   Third, consider the harm: I can find no basis for the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that, were the transmissions to other\ncourtrooms to take place, the applicants would suffer\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nirreparable harm. Certainly there is no evidence that\nsuch harm could arise in this nonjury civil case from the\nsimple fact of transmission itself. By my count, 42 States\nand two Federal District Courts currently give judges the\ndiscretion to broadcast civil nonjury trials. See Media\nPrivacy and Related Law 2009\u201310 (2009) (collecting state\nstatutes and rules); Civ. Rule 1.8 (SDNY 2009); Civ. Rule\n1.8 (EDNY 2009). Neither the applicants nor anyone else\n\u201chas been able to present empirical data sufficient to\nestablish that the mere presence of the broadcast media\ninherently has an adverse effect on [the judicial] process,\u201d\nChandler v. Florida, 449 U. S. 560, 578\u2013579 (1981). Cf. M.\nCohn & D. Dow, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television\nand the Pursuit of Justice 62\u201364 (1998) (canvassing stud\nies, none of which found harm, and one of which found\nthat witnesses \u201cwho faced an obvious camera, provided\nanswers that were more correct, lengthier and more de\ntailed\u201d). And, in any event, any harm to the parties, in\ncluding the applicants, is reparable through appeal. Cf.\nChandler, supra, at 581.\n   The applicants also claim that the transmission will\nirreparably harm the witnesses themselves, presumably\nby increasing the public\u2019s awareness of who those wit\nnesses are. And they claim that some members of the\npublic might harass those witnesses. But the witnesses,\nalthough capable of doing so, have not asked this Court to\nset aside the District Court\u2019s order. Cf. Miller v. Albright,\n523 U. S. 420, 445 (1998) (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by\nKENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Powers v. Ohio,\n499 U. S. 400, 411 (1991). And that is not surprising. All\nof the witnesses supporting the applicants are already\npublicly identified with their cause. They are all experts\nor advocates who have either already appeared on televi\nsion or Internet broadcasts, already toured the State\nadvocating a \u201cyes\u201d vote on Proposition 8, or already en\ngaged in extensive public commentary far more likely to\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmake them well known than a closed-circuit broadcast to\nanother federal courthouse.\n   The likelihood of any \u201cirreparable\u201d harm is further\ndiminished by the fact that the court order before us\nwould simply increase the trial\u2019s viewing audience from\nthe occupants of one courtroom in one courthouse to the\noccupants of five other courtrooms in five other court\nhouses (in all of which taking pictures or retransmissions\nhave been forbidden). By way of comparison literally\nhundreds of national and international newspapers are\nalready covering this trial and reporting in detail the\nnames and testimony of all of the witnesses. See, e.g.,\nLeff, Woman Recalls Emotional Ordeal of Gay Marriage\nBan, Associated Press, Jan. 11, 2010. I see no reason why\nthe incremental increase in exposure caused by transmit\nting these proceedings to five additional courtrooms would\ncreate any further risk of harm, as the Court apparently\nbelieves. See ante, at 13. Moreover, if in respect to any\nparticular witness this transmission threatens harm, the\nDistrict Court can prevent that harm. Chief Judge\nWalker has already said that he would keep the broadcast\n\u201ccompletely under the Court\u2019s control, to permit the Court\nto stop it if [it] proves to be a problem, if it proves to be a\ndistraction, [or] if it proves to create problems with wit\nnesses.\u201d See Exh. 2, at 45, App. to Pet. The Circuit Coun\ncil confirmed in a press release that the District Court\n\u201cwill fully control the process\u201d and that \u201cJudge Walker has\nreserved the right to terminate any part of the audio\nor video, or both, for any duration\u201d or to terminate par\nticipation in the pilot program \u201cat any time.\u201d News\nRelease, Federal Courthouses to Offer Remote Viewing\nof Pro-position 8 Trial (Jan. 8, 2010), http://www.\nca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/01/08/Prop8_\nRemote_Viewing_Locations.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2010,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Surely such\nfirm control, exercised by an able district court judge with\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n20 years of trial-management experience, will be sufficient\nto address any possible harm, either to the witnesses or to\nthe integrity of the trial.\n   Fourth, no fair balancing of the equities (including harm\nto the public interest) could support issuance of the stay.\nSee Times-Picayune Publishing Corp. v. Schulingkamp,\n419 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1974) (Powell, J. in Chambers)\n(recognizing \u201csignificant public and private interests\nbalanced on both sides\u201d when \u201cpresent[ed with] a funda\nmental confrontation between the competing values of free\npress and fair trial\u201d). As I have just explained, the appli\ncants\u2019 equities consist of potential harm to witnesses\u2014\nharm that is either nonexistent or that can be cured\nthrough protective measures by the District Court as the\ncircumstances warrant. The competing equities consist of\nnot only respondents\u2019 interest in obtaining the courthouse\nto-courthouse transmission that they desire, but also the\npublic\u2019s interest in observing trial proceedings to learn\nabout this case and about how courts work. See Nebraska\nPress Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 587 (1976) (Brennan,\nJ., concurring in judgment); see also Exh. 2, at 42, App. to\nPet. (statement of Chief Judge Walker) (\u201c[I]f the public\ncould see how the judicial process works, they would take\na somewhat different view of it.\u201d \u201cI think the only time\nthat you\u2019re going to draw sufficient interest in the legal\nprocess is when you have an issue such as the issues here,\nthat people think about, talk about, debate about and\nconsider\u201d). With these considerations in the balance, the\nscales tip heavily against, not in favor, of issuing the stay.\n   The majority\u2019s action today is unusual. It grants a stay\nin order to consider a mandamus petition, with a view to\nintervening in a matter of local court administration that\nit would not (and should not) consider. It cites no prece\ndent for doing so. It identifies no real harm, let alone\n\u201cirreparable harm,\u201d to justify its issuance of this stay.\nAnd the public interest weighs in favor of providing access\n10              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the courts. To justify this extraordinary intervention,\nthe majority insists that courts must \u201cenforce the re\nquirement of procedural regularity on others, and must\nfollow those requirements themselves.\u201d Ante, at 1. And so\ntoo I believe this Court should adhere to its institutional\ncompetence, its historical practice, and its governing\nprecedent\u2014all of which counsel strongly against the issu\nance of this stay.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
