Sierra Pacific Power\n  Co., 350 U.

No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.\n     For many years, New England\u2019s supply of electricity capacity was\n  barely sufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New Eng\n  land\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made\n  several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the\n  latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com\n  prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab\n  lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro\n  vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern\n  rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre\n  sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public\n  interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir\n  cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC\u2019s approval\n  order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate\n  is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra\u2019s public in\n  terest standard does not apply.\nHeld: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of\n the complainant who seeks FERC investigation. The presumption is\n not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting par\n2           NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                        UTIL.

Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but\n    its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s holding mis\n    perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc\n    trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals\u2019 disposi\n    tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra\u2019s\n    instruction to FERC to \u201cpresume that the rate set out in a freely ne\n    gotiated . . . contract meets the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 requirement\u201d\n    unless \u201cFERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public\n    interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it\n    unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the\n    D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,\n    the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard. Rather, the public interest stan\n    dard defines \u201cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and\n    reasonable standard in the contract context.\u201d Id., at ___. And if\n    FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result\n    ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may\n    not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine\n    does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con\n    tract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming public.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n    ___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit\u2019s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate\n    challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine\u2019s animating\n    purpose: promotion of \u201cthe stability of supply arrangements which all\n    agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.\u201d Mobile, 350\n    U. S., at 344. A presumption applicable to contracting parties only,\n    and inoperative as to everyone else\u2014consumers, advocacy groups,\n    state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriae\u2014\n    could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.\n    Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) Whether the rates at issue qualify as \u201ccontract rates\u201d for Mo\n    bile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to\n    treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled\n    upon by, the D. C. Circuit. They remain open for that court\u2019s consid\n    eration on remand.

S. C. \u00a7791a et seq., authorizes the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) to\nsuperintend the sale of electricity in interstate commerce\nand provides that all wholesale-electricity rates must be\n\u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d \u00a7824d(a). Under this Court\u2019s Mo\nbile-Sierra doctrine, FERC must presume that a rate set\nby \u201ca freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract\u201d meets\nthe statutory \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d requirement. Morgan\nStanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of\nSnohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1).\n\u201cThe presumption may be overcome only if FERC con\u00ad\ncludes that the contract seriously harms the public inter\u00ad\nest.\u201d Ibid.\n   This case stems from New England\u2019s difficulties in\nmaintaining the reliability of its energy grid. In 2006,\nafter several attempts by the Commission and concerned\nparties to address the problems, FERC approved a com\u00ad\nprehensive settlement agreement (hereinafter Settlement\nAgreement or Agreement).         Most relevant here, the\n2       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL.

C. Circuit.\nAmong multiple objections to FERC\u2019s order approving the\nAgreement, the settlement opponents urged that the rate\nchallenges of nonsettling parties should not be controlled\nby the restrictive Mobile-Sierra public interest standard.\nThe Court of Appeals agreed, holding that \u201cwhen a rate\nchallenge is brought by a non-contracting third party, the\nMobile-Sierra doctrine simply does not apply.\u201d Maine Pub.\nUtil. Comm\u2019n v. FERC, 520 F. 3d 464, 478 (2008) (per\ncuriam).\n   We reverse the D. C. Circuit\u2019s judgment to the extent\nthat it rejects the application of Mobile-Sierra to noncon\u00ad\ntracting parties. Our decision in Morgan Stanley, an\u00ad\nnounced three months after the D. C. Circuit\u2019s disposition,\nmade clear that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard\nis not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard; it is an application of that standard in the con\u00ad\ntext of rates set by contract. The \u201cvenerable Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine\u201d rests on \u201cthe stabilizing force of contracts.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19); see id.,\nat 22 (describing contract rates as \u201ca key source of stabil\u00ad\nity\u201d). To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC\nitself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought\nby noncontracting as well as contracting parties.\n                               I\n  In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale energy\nmarket, an electricity provider purchases from a generator\nan option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than pur\u00ad\nchasing the energy itself. To maintain the reliability of\nthe grid, electricity providers generally purchase more\ncapacity, i.e., rights to acquire energy, than necessary to\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

For many\nyears in New England, the supply of capacity was barely\nsufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New\nEngland\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power\ncustomers made several attempts to address this problem.\nThis case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.\n  In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into\n\u201creliability must-run\u201d agreements with the New England\nIndependent System Operator (ISO), which operates the\nregion\u2019s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing\nthose agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a\nnew market mechanism that would set prices separately\nfor various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,\n103 FERC \u00b661,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).\n  In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure\nresponsive to FERC\u2019s directions. See Devon Power LLC,\n107 FERC \u00b661,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter\nfor hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),\nwho issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO\u2019s\nproposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC \u00b663,063, p. 65,205\n(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s order;\non September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu\u00ad\nments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter\nestablished settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113\nFERC \u00b661,075, p. 61,271 (2005).\n  After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a\nsettlement was reached. Of the 115 negotiating parties,\nonly 8 opposed the settlement.\n  The Settlement Agreement installed a \u201cforward capacity\nmarket\u201d under which annual auctions would set capacity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An ISO is an independent company that has operational control, but\n\nnot ownership, of the transmission facilities owned by member utilities.\nISOs \u201cprovide open access to the regional transmission system to all\nelectricity generators at rates established in a single, unbundled, grid\u00ad\nwide tariff . . . .\u201d Midwest ISO Transmission Owners v.

COMM\u2019N                                      \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\nprices; auctions would be conducted three years in ad\u00ad\nvance of the time when the capacity would be needed.\nDevon Power LLC, 115 FERC \u00b661,340, pp. 62,304, 62,306\u2013\n62,308 (2006). Each energy provider would be required to\npurchase enough capacity to meet its share of the \u201cin\u00ad\nstalled capacity requirement,\u201d i.e., the minimum level of\ncapacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as\ndetermined by the ISO. Id., at 62,307. For the three-year\ngap between the first auction and the time when the ca\u00ad\npacity procured in that auction would be provided,2 the\nAgreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period\npayments to capacity-supplying generators.           Id., at\n62,308\u201362,309.\n  The issue before us centers on \u00a74.C of the Agreement\n(hereinafter Mobile-Sierra provision). Under that provi\u00ad\nsion, challenges to both transition-period payments and\nauction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under \u201cthe\n\u2018public interest\u2019 standard of review set forth in United Gas\nPipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332\n(1956)[,] and [FPC] v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S.\n348 (1956) (the \u2018Mobile-Sierra\u2019 doctrine).\u201d App. 95. Mo\nbile-Sierra applies, \u00a74.C instructs, \u201cwhether the [price is\nchallenged] by a Settling Party, a non-Settling Party, or\n[by] the FERC acting sua sponte.\u201d Ibid.\n  FERC approved the Settlement Agreement, \u201cfinding\nthat as a package, it presents a just and reasonable out\u00ad\ncome for this proceeding consistent with the public inter\u00ad\nest.\u201d 115 FERC, at 62,304. The Mobile-Sierra provision,\nFERC explicitly determined, \u201cappropriately balances the\nneed for rate stability and the interests of the diverse\nentities who will be subject to the [forward capacity mar\u00ad\nket\u2019s auction system].\u201d Id., at 62,335.\n  Six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought re\u00ad\nview in the D. C. Circuit. For the most part, the Court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The   transition period runs from December 1, 2006 to June 1, 2010.\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals rejected the objectors\u2019 efforts to overturn FERC\u2019s\norder approving the settlement. 520 F. 3d, at 467. But\nthe objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The\nD. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con\u00ad\ntracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties\nhave switched places. Defenders of the settlement, includ\u00ad\ning the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors\nto the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only\non the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents.\n   Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of\nour recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certio\u00ad\nrari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: \u201c[Does]\nMobile-Sierra\u2019s public-interest standard appl[y] when a\ncontract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a\nparty to the contract[?]\u201d Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied\nthat the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the\nD. C. Circuit\u2019s judgment insofar as it rejected application\nof Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.\n                               II\n  The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the \u201csale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\u201d See\n16 U. S. C. \u00a7824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities\nto set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and\nbuyers may agree on rates by contract. See \u00a7824d(c), (d).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must\nbe \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d \u00a7824d(a). Rates may be exam\u00ad\nined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own\ninitiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed\nor after a rate goes into effect. \u00a7\u00a7824d(e), 824e(a). Follow\u00ad\ning a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate\nfound \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or\npreferential,\u201d and replace it with a just and reasonable\nrate. \u00a7824e(a).\n  The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions\nannounced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line\n6       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL. COMM\u2019N                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCo. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.\nSierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned\nrates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved\nthe Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili\u00ad\nties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility\u2019s\nargument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author\u00ad\nized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur\u00ad\nchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336\u2013337.\nFiling, we explained, was a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful\ncontract. Id., at 339\u2013344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had\nthe Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed\ntariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com\u00ad\nmission had suggested that, in any event, the contract\nrate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust\nand unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so\n\u201csolely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair\nreturn on the [utility\u2019s] net invested capital.\u201d 350 U. S., at\n355.\n   The Commission\u2019s suggestion prompted this Court to\nhome in on \u201cthe question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The\nSierra Court answered the question this way:\n    \u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af\u00ad\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n     Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n     low as to adversely affect the public interest\u2014as where\n     it might impair the financial ability of the public util\u00ad\n     ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers\n     an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.\u201d\n     350 U. S., at 354\u2013355 (some emphasis added).\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: \u201cThe regulatory\nsystem created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual\nagreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa\u00ad\nnies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.\u201d Per\nmian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3\n   Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the\nCourt reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\nThat case presented two questions: First, does the Mobile-\nSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated\nbetween sophisticated parties meet the just and reason\u00ad\nable standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. \u00a7824d(a)) \u201capply only\nwhen FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a\ncontract rate without the presumption?\u201d 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 1). \u201cSecond, does the presumption [generally]\nimpose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of whole\u00ad\nsale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?\u201d Id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in Mobile-\n\nSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and\nWater Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110\u2013113 (1958), that parties may contract\nout of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by\nspecifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission\nwould supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an\noption midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract\nthat does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a\nnew rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the\ncontract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further\nshowing that it adversely affects the public interest. See, e.g., Papago\nTribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisiana\nPower & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675\u2013676 (CA5 1979).\n8       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Answering no to\nthe first question and yes to the second, the Court empha\u00ad\nsized the essential role of contracts as a key factor foster\u00ad\ning stability in the electricity market, to the longrun bene\u00ad\nfit of consumers.

But Morgan Stanley\u2019s reasoning strongly sug\u00ad\ngests that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s negative answer misperceives\nthe aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine.\n   In unmistakably plain language, Morgan Stanley re\u00ad\nstated Mobile-Sierra\u2019s instruction to the Commission:\nFERC \u201cmust presume that the rate set out in a freely\nnegotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the \u2018just and\nreasonable\u2019 requirement imposed by law. The presump\u00ad\ntion may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the\ncontract seriously harms the public interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). As our instruction to FERC in Morgan\nStanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the\nD. C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and\nsometimes at odds with, the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d stan\u00ad\ndard, see 520 F. 3d, at 478; rather, the public interest\nstandard defines \u201cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the\njust-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

And if\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption? 4\n   Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook\nthird-party interests; it is framed with a view to their\nprotection. The doctrine directs the Commission to reject\na contract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming pub\u00ad\nlic.\u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); see\nVerizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.

C.\nCircuit\u2019s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges\nby contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose\nof the doctrine: promotion of \u201cthe stability of supply ar\u00ad\nrangements which all agree is essential to the health of\nthe [energy] industry.\u201d Mobile, 350 U.

These\nreasons for the presumption explain why FERC, surely not legally\nbound by a contract rate, must apply the presumption and, correspond\u00ad\ningly, why third parties are similarly controlled by it.\n10        NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Only if the rate was so\nlow that the seller might be unable to stay in business,\nthereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be\nexcused from performing its contract. That is what the\nCourt held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas\nService Corp., 350 U. S. 332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348 (1956).\n  In the second chapter the Court unwisely and incor\nrectly held that the same rule should apply to a buyer who\nhad been forced by unprecedented market conditions to\nenter into a long-term contract to buy energy at abnor\nmally high prices. The Court held the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a\ncontract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad\ndled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be\nconsidered unjust and unreasonable under normal market\n2         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(rejecting the \u201cobviously indefensible proposition that a\nstandard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard applies to contract rates\u201d). But applying the\npresumption nonetheless sets a higher bar for a rate chal\nlenge.1 FERC may abrogate the rate only if the public\ninterest is seriously harmed. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22)\n(\u201c[U]nder the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside a\ncontract rate requires a finding of \u2018unequivocal public\nnecessity,\u2019 \u201d Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.

Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 8). It does not establish a new standard that\napplies as well to a \u201chigh-rate challenge\u201d brought by pur\nchasers. Ibid.\n   But even accepting Morgan Stanley as the law, the\nCourt unwisely goes further today. In this third chapter of\nthe Mobile-Sierra story, the Court applies a rule\u2014one\ndesigned initially to protect the enforceability of freely\nnegotiated contracts against parties who seek a release\nfrom their obligations\u2014to impose a special burden on\nthird parties exercising their statutory right to object to\nunjust and unreasonable rates. This application of the\nrule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set\nforth in the first chapter of this tale. As the Court of\nAppeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court\nsets aside today: \u201cThis case is clearly outside the scope of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\u201d Maine Pub. Util.

This Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of Sierra provides an answer. \u201cSierra was\ngrounded in the commonsense notion that \u2018[i]n wholesale\nmarkets, the party charging the rate and the party\ncharged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying\npresumptively equal bargaining power, who could be\nexpected to negotiate a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate as be\ntween the two of them.\u2019 \u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 17) (quoting Verizon Communications Inc. v.\nFCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479 (2002); emphasis added). This\n\u201ccommonsense notion\u201d supports the rule requiring FERC\nto apply a presumption against letting a party out of its\nown contract, as the D. C. Circuit recognized. 520 F. 3d,\nat 478 (\u201cThe Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies a more defer\nential standard of review to preserve the terms of the\nbargain as between the contracting parties\u201d). It does not,\nhowever, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a pre\nsumption against abrogating any rate set by contract,\neven when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be\nrequired in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.\n   The Court further reasons that \u201cconfinement of Mobile-\nSierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes\nthe animating purpose of the doctrine,\u201d which is ensuring\nthe stability of contract-based supply arrangements. Ante,\nat 9. Maybe so, but applying Mobile-Sierra to rate chal\nlenges by noncontracting parties loses sight of the animat\ning purpose of the FPA, which is \u201cthe protection of the\npublic interest.\u201d Sierra, 350 U.

Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The Court\ntoday imposes additional limits upon FERC\u2019s ability to\nprotect that interest.

In addition to requiring that\nFERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be\nrequired under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore,\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine leaves little room for respondents\u2014at least\none of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase\nelectricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self\nsupplies its capacity\u2014to assert their private interest in making a rate\nchallenge. The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under\nthe public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates\nbetween allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale custom\ners, ante, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still\nhave to show that circumstance harmed the public interest. It remains\nunclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell\nelectricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the\n\u201cpublic interest standard\u201d because the rate is detrimental to that\nentity\u2019s private interest.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.\n     For many years, New England\u2019s supply of electricity capacity was\n  barely sufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New Eng\n  land\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made\n  several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the\n  latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com\n  prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab\n  lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro\n  vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern\n  rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre\n  sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public\n  interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir\n  cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC\u2019s approval\n  order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate\n  is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra\u2019s public in\n  terest standard does not apply.\nHeld: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of\n the complainant who seeks FERC investigation. The presumption is\n not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting par\n2           NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                        UTIL.

Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but\n    its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s holding mis\n    perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc\n    trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals\u2019 disposi\n    tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra\u2019s\n    instruction to FERC to \u201cpresume that the rate set out in a freely ne\n    gotiated . . . contract meets the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 requirement\u201d\n    unless \u201cFERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public\n    interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it\n    unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the\n    D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,\n    the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard. Rather, the public interest stan\n    dard defines \u201cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and\n    reasonable standard in the contract context.\u201d Id., at ___. And if\n    FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result\n    ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may\n    not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine\n    does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con\n    tract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming public.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n    ___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit\u2019s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate\n    challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine\u2019s animating\n    purpose: promotion of \u201cthe stability of supply arrangements which all\n    agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.\u201d Mobile, 350\n    U.

A presumption applicable to contracting parties only,\n    and inoperative as to everyone else\u2014consumers, advocacy groups,\n    state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriae\u2014\n    could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.\n    Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) Whether the rates at issue qualify as \u201ccontract rates\u201d for Mo\n    bile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to\n    treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled\n    upon by, the D.

For many\nyears in New England, the supply of capacity was barely\nsufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New\nEngland\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power\ncustomers made several attempts to address this problem.\nThis case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.\n  In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into\n\u201creliability must-run\u201d agreements with the New England\nIndependent System Operator (ISO), which operates the\nregion\u2019s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing\nthose agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a\nnew market mechanism that would set prices separately\nfor various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,\n103 FERC \u00b661,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).\n  In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure\nresponsive to FERC\u2019s directions. See Devon Power LLC,\n107 FERC \u00b661,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter\nfor hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),\nwho issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO\u2019s\nproposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC \u00b663,063, p. 65,205\n(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s order;\non September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu\u00ad\nments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter\nestablished settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113\nFERC \u00b661,075, p. 61,271 (2005).\n  After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a\nsettlement was reached.

Each energy provider would be required to\npurchase enough capacity to meet its share of the \u201cin\u00ad\nstalled capacity requirement,\u201d i.e., the minimum level of\ncapacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as\ndetermined by the ISO. Id., at 62,307. For the three-year\ngap between the first auction and the time when the ca\u00ad\npacity procured in that auction would be provided,2 the\nAgreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period\npayments to capacity-supplying generators.

But\nthe objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The\nD. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con\u00ad\ntracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties\nhave switched places.

S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: \u201c[Does]\nMobile-Sierra\u2019s public-interest standard appl[y] when a\ncontract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a\nparty to the contract[?]\u201d Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied\nthat the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the\nD. C. Circuit\u2019s judgment insofar as it rejected application\nof Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.\n                               II\n  The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the \u201csale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\u201d See\n16 U. S. C. \u00a7824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities\nto set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and\nbuyers may agree on rates by contract. See \u00a7824d(c), (d).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must\nbe \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d \u00a7824d(a). Rates may be exam\u00ad\nined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own\ninitiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed\nor after a rate goes into effect. \u00a7\u00a7824d(e), 824e(a). Follow\u00ad\ning a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate\nfound \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or\npreferential,\u201d and replace it with a just and reasonable\nrate. \u00a7824e(a).\n  The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions\nannounced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line\n6       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL. COMM\u2019N                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCo. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.\nSierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned\nrates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved\nthe Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili\u00ad\nties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility\u2019s\nargument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author\u00ad\nized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur\u00ad\nchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336\u2013337.\nFiling, we explained, was a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful\ncontract. Id., at 339\u2013344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had\nthe Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed\ntariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com\u00ad\nmission had suggested that, in any event, the contract\nrate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust\nand unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so\n\u201csolely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair\nreturn on the [utility\u2019s] net invested capital.\u201d 350 U. S., at\n355.\n   The Commission\u2019s suggestion prompted this Court to\nhome in on \u201cthe question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The\nSierra Court answered the question this way:\n    \u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af\u00ad\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n     Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n     low as to adversely affect the public interest\u2014as where\n     it might impair the financial ability of the public util\u00ad\n     ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers\n     an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.\u201d\n     350 U. S., at 354\u2013355 (some emphasis added).\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: \u201cThe regulatory\nsystem created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual\nagreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa\u00ad\nnies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.\u201d Per\nmian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3\n   Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the\nCourt reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\nThat case presented two questions: First, does the Mobile-\nSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated\nbetween sophisticated parties meet the just and reason\u00ad\nable standard imposed by 16 U.

They could do so, we ruled, by\nspecifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission\nwould supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an\noption midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract\nthat does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a\nnew rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the\ncontract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further\nshowing that it adversely affects the public interest.

But Morgan Stanley\u2019s reasoning strongly sug\u00ad\ngests that the D. C.

The presump\u00ad\ntion may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the\ncontract seriously harms the public interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). As our instruction to FERC in Morgan\nStanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the\nD. C.

And if\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption? 4\n   Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook\nthird-party interests; it is framed with a view to their\nprotection. The doctrine directs the Commission to reject\na contract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming pub\u00ad\nlic.\u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U.

Only if the rate was so\nlow that the seller might be unable to stay in business,\nthereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be\nexcused from performing its contract.

The Court held the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a\ncontract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad\ndled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be\nconsidered unjust and unreasonable under normal market\n2         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Ibid.\n   But even accepting Morgan Stanley as the law, the\nCourt unwisely goes further today. In this third chapter of\nthe Mobile-Sierra story, the Court applies a rule\u2014one\ndesigned initially to protect the enforceability of freely\nnegotiated contracts against parties who seek a release\nfrom their obligations\u2014to impose a special burden on\nthird parties exercising their statutory right to object to\nunjust and unreasonable rates. This application of the\nrule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set\nforth in the first chapter of this tale. As the Court of\nAppeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court\nsets aside today: \u201cThis case is clearly outside the scope of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\u201d Maine Pub. Util.

This Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of Sierra provides an answer. \u201cSierra was\ngrounded in the commonsense notion that \u2018[i]n wholesale\nmarkets, the party charging the rate and the party\ncharged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying\npresumptively equal bargaining power, who could be\nexpected to negotiate a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate as be\ntween the two of them.\u2019 \u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U.

This\n\u201ccommonsense notion\u201d supports the rule requiring FERC\nto apply a presumption against letting a party out of its\nown contract, as the D. C. Circuit recognized. 520 F. 3d,\nat 478 (\u201cThe Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies a more defer\nential standard of review to preserve the terms of the\nbargain as between the contracting parties\u201d). It does not,\nhowever, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a pre\nsumption against abrogating any rate set by contract,\neven when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be\nrequired in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.\n   The Court further reasons that \u201cconfinement of Mobile-\nSierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes\nthe animating purpose of the doctrine,\u201d which is ensuring\nthe stability of contract-based supply arrangements.

In addition to requiring that\nFERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be\nrequired under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore,\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine leaves little room for respondents\u2014at least\none of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase\nelectricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self\nsupplies its capacity\u2014to assert their private interest in making a rate\nchallenge. The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under\nthe public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates\nbetween allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale custom\ners, ante, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still\nhave to show that circumstance harmed the public interest. It remains\nunclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell\nelectricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the\n\u201cpublic interest standard\u201d because the rate is detrimental to that\nentity\u2019s private interest.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npreserved unless there is extraordinary harm to the public\ninterest.\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
