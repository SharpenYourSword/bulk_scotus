SPISAK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013724.      Argued October 13, 2009\u2014Decided January 12, 2010\nAfter the Ohio courts sentenced respondent Spisak to death and denied\n  his claims on direct appeal and collateral review, he filed a federal\n  habeas petition claiming that, at his trial\u2019s penalty phase, (1) the in\n  structions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to\n  consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to\n  be mitigating, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and (2) his coun\n  sel\u2019s inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assis\n  tance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The\n  District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both\n  arguments and ordered relief.\nHeld:\n    1. Because the state court\u2019s upholding of the mitigation jury in\n structions and forms was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable ap\n plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from\n reaching a contrary decision. The Court of Appeals erred in holding\n that the instructions and forms contravened Mills, in which this\n Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue vio\n lated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that\n it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all\n 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to\n exist, 486 U. S., at 380\u2013381, 384. Even assuming that Mills sets\n forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for reviewing the\n state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here\n differ significantly from those in Mills: They made clear that, to rec\n ommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that\n each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circum\n stances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the exis\n2                            SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously. Nor did they\n    say anything about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make in\n    dividual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance\n    existed. They focused only on the overall question of balancing the\n    aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury\n    to consider all relevant evidence. Thus, the instructions and verdict\n    forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or\n    what they implied, the constitutional error in the Mills instructions.\n    Pp. 2\u20139.\n       2. Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\n    assistance-of-counsel claim was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreason\n    able application\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n    \u00a72254(d)(1). To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, inter alia,\n    that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unpro\n    fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ\n    ent.\u201d Strickland, supra, at 694. Even assuming that the closing ar\n    gument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court\n    finds no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing argument\n    without these defects would have made a significant difference. Any\n    different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in\n    the following context: Spisak\u2019s defense at the trial\u2019s guilt phase con\n    sisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by\n    reason of insanity. Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate\n    Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where\n    he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shoot\n    ings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further mur\n    ders if given the opportunity. In light of this background and for the\n    following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not\n    raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for\n    the deficient closing. First, since the sentencing phase took place\n    immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds\n    the government\u2019s extensive and graphic evidence regarding the kill\n    ings, Spisak\u2019s boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats\n    to commit further violent acts. Second, although counsel did not\n    summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it,\n    and the defense experts\u2019 more detailed testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s\n    mental illness was also fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds. Third, Spisak does\n    not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have men\n    tioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the\n    \u201cmental defect\u201d factor that the defense experts described. Finally, in\n    light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the jurors\u2019 sense of humanity, it\n    is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could\n    have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing\n    circumstances.

FRANK G.\n\n                 SPISAK, JR. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 12, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Frank G. Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in\nan Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted\nmurders. He was sentenced to death. He filed a habeas\ncorpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitu\ntional errors occurred at his trial. First, Spisak claimed\nthat the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitu\ntionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only\nthose factors that the jury unanimously found to be miti\ngating. See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).\nSecond, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm\nas a result of his counsel\u2019s inadequate closing argument at\nthe penalty phase of the proceeding. See Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Federal Court of\nAppeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas\nrelief. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                            I\n  In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders\nand two attempted murders at Cleveland State University\nin 1982. The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a\ndeath sentence. The Ohio courts denied Spisak\u2019s claims,\n2                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nboth on direct appeal and on collateral review. State v.\nSpisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d 800 (1988) (per\ncuriam); State v. Spisak, No. 67229, 1995 WL 229108\n(Ohio App., 8th Dist., Cuyahoga Cty., Apr. 13, 1995); State\nv. Spisak, 73 Ohio St. 3d 151, 652 N. E. 2d 719 (1995) (per\ncuriam).\n   Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.\nAmong other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase\nof his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two\nreasons we consider here. The District Court denied his\npetition. Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio,\nApr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. But the Court of\nAppeals accepted Spisak\u2019s two claims, namely, his mitiga\ntion instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d 684, 703\u2013706,\n708\u2013711 (CA6 2006). The Court of Appeals consequently\nordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of\nhabeas corpus forbidding Spisak\u2019s execution. Id., at 715\u2013\n716.\n   The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.\nWe granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U. S. 945 (2007). We\nremanded the case for further consideration in light of two\nrecent cases in which this Court had held that lower fed\neral courts had not properly taken account of the defer\nence federal law grants state-court determinations on\nfederal habeas review. Ibid.; see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d);\nCarey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70 (2006); Schriro v. Landri\ngan, 550 U. S. 465 (2007). On remand, the Sixth Circuit\nreinstated its earlier opinion. Spisak v. Hudson, 512 F. 3d\n852, 853\u2013854 (2008). The State again sought certiorari.\nWe again granted the petition. And we now reverse.\n                             II\n  Spisak\u2019s first claim concerns the instructions and verdict\nforms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial. The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instruc\ntions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instruc\ntions, taken together with the forms, \u201crequire[d]\u201d juror\n\u201cunanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor\u201d\u2014\ncontrary to this Court\u2019s holding in Mills v. Maryland,\nsupra. 465 F. 3d, at 708. Since the parties do not dispute\nthat the Ohio courts \u201cadjudicated\u201d this claim, i.e., they\nconsidered and rejected it \u201con the merits,\u201d the law permits\na federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the\nstate-court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an un\nreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). Unlike the Court of\nAppeals, we conclude that Spisak\u2019s claim does not satisfy\nthis standard.\n   The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that\nMills sets forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal\nlaw.\u201d While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether\nMills was \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for the purpose\nof reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we shall\nassume the same. Compare Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 390 (2000) (STEVENS, J., for the Court) (applicable\ndate for purposes of determining whether \u201cFederal law\u201d is\n\u201cestablished\u201d is when the \u201cstate-court conviction became\nfinal\u201d), with id., at 412 (O\u2019Connor, J., for the Court) (appli\ncable date is \u201cthe time of the relevant state-court deci\nsion\u201d); see State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d\n800 (decided Apr. 13, 1988), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071\n(decided Mar. 6, 1989); Mills v. Maryland, supra (decided\nJune 6, 1988).\n                             A\n  The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two\nwell-established principles. First, the Constitution forbids\nimposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or\njury is \u201c \u2018 \u201cprecluded from considering, as a mitigating\n4                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfactor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and\nany of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant\nproffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 486\nU. S., at 374 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,\n110 (1982), in turn quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,\n604 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Second, the sentencing\njudge or jury \u201c \u2018 may not refuse to consider or be precluded\nfrom considering \u201cany relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nMills, 486 U. S., at 374\u2013375 (quoting Skipper v. South\nCarolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings,\nsupra, at 114).\n   Applying these principles, the Court held that the jury\ninstructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated\nthe Constitution because, read naturally, they told the\njury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be\nmitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating\ncircumstance had been proved to exist. Mills, 486 U. S., at\n380\u2013381, 384. If, for example, the defense presents evi\ndence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some\njurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some\nonly the second, and some only the third. But if even one\nof the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating\nconsiderations exists, but that he is barred from consider\ning it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held,\nthe Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.\nSee id., at 380, 384; see also McKoy v. North Carolina, 494\nU. S. 433, 442\u2013443 (1990) (\u201cMills requires that each juror\nbe permitted to consider and give effect to . . . all mitigat\ning evidence in deciding . . . whether aggravating circum\nstances outweigh mitigating circumstances . . . \u201d). Because\nthe instructions in Mills would have led a reasonable juror\nto believe the contrary, the Court held that the sentencing\nproceeding violated the Constitution. 486 U. S., at 374\u2013\n375.\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010) \n           5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   In evaluating the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination here,\nwe have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms\nat issue in Mills and compared them with those used in\nthe present case. In the Mills sentencing phase, the trial\njudge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had\nthree distinct parts. Section I set forth a list of 10 specific\naggravating circumstances next to which were spaces\nwhere the jury was to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Just above the\nlist, the form said:\n       \u201cBased upon the evidence we unanimously find that\n    each of the following aggravating circumstances which\n    is marked \u2018yes\u2019 has been proven . . . and each aggra\n    vating circumstance which is marked \u2018no\u2019 has not been\n    proven . . . .\u201d 486 U. S., at 384\u2013385 (emphasis added;\n    internal quotation marks omitted).\nSection II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating\ncircumstances (seven specific circumstances and the\neighth designated as \u201cother\u201d) next to which were spaces\nwhere the jury was to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Just above the\nlist the form said:\n       \u201cBased upon the evidence we unanimously find that\n    each of the following mitigating circumstances which\n    is marked \u2018yes\u2019 has been proven to exist . . . and each\n    mitigating circumstance marked \u2018no\u2019 has not been\n    proven . . . .\u201d Id., at 387 (emphasis added; internal\n    quotation marks omitted).\nSection III set forth the overall balancing question, along\nwith spaces for the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d It said:\n       \u201cBased on the evidence we unanimously find that it\n    has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances\n    marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section II outweigh the aggravating\n    circumstances marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section I.\u201d Id., at 388\u2013\n    389 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit\n6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    ted).\n   Explaining the forms, the judge instructed the jury with\nan example. He told the jury that it should mark \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 \u201d\non the jury form if it \u201c \u2018unanimously\u2019 \u201d concluded that an\naggravating circumstance had been proved. Id., at 378.\nOtherwise, he said, \u201c \u2018of course you must answer no.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (emphasis deleted). These instructions, together\nwith the forms, told the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d on Section II\u2019s\nlist of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously\nconcluded that the particular mitigating factor had been\nproved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section\nIII only those mitigating factors marked \u201cyes\u201d in Section\nII. Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that\nit could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravat\ning and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors\nthat the jury had unanimously found to exist. See id., at\n380\u2013381.\n   The instructions and jury forms in this case differ sig\nnificantly from those in Mills. The trial judge instructed\nthe jury that the aggravating factors they would consider\nwere the specifications that the jury had found proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial\u2014\nessentially, that each murder was committed in a course of\nconduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the\nmurders, that the murder was committed with the intent\nto evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.\n8 Tr. 2967\u20132972 (July 19, 1983).\n   He then explained the concept of a \u201cmitigating factor.\u201d\nAfter doing so, he listed examples, including that \u201cthe\ndefendant because of a mental disease or defect . . . lacked\nsubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of\nthe law.\u201d Id., at 2972\u20132973. The court also told the jury\nthat it could take account of \u201cany other\u201d mitigating consid\neration it found \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Id., at\n2965.\n   With respect to \u201cthe procedure\u201d by which the jury should\nreach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following:\n    \u201c[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant\n    evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony\n    received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.\n    From this you must determine whether, beyond a rea\n    sonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which\n    [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the\n    separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors present in this case.\n      \u201cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stance in each separate count outweighs the mitigat\n    ing factors, then you must return that finding to the\n    Court.\n         .           .           .          .            .\n      \u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the\n    testimony received at this hearing and the arguments\n    of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of com\n    mitting in the separate counts outweigh the\n    mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine\n    which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to\n    recommend to the Court.\u201d Id., at 2973\u20132975.\n  The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each ag\ngravating factor. The first of the two forms said:\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury in this case . . . do find beyond a reason\n    able doubt that the aggravating circumstance . . . was\n8                     SMITH v.

But\nthe instructions did not say that the jury must determine\nthe existence of each individual mitigating factor unani\nmously. Neither the instructions nor the forms said any\nthing about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make\nindividual determinations that each particular mitigating\ncircumstance existed. They focused only on the overall\nbalancing question. And the instructions repeatedly told\nthe jury to \u201cconside[r] all of the relevant evidence.\u201d Id., at\n2974. In our view the instructions and verdict forms did\nnot clearly bring about, either through what they said or\nwhat they implied, the circumstance that Mills found\ncritical, namely,\n    \u201ca substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon\n    receiving the judge\u2019s instructions in this case, and in\n    attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,\n    well may have thought they were precluded from con\n    sidering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors\n    agreed on the existence of a particular such circum\n    stance.\u201d 486 U.

S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion upholding these forms and instructions was not \u201ccon\ntrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States\u201d in Mills.          28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury in\nstructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that\nthe instructions \u201crequire[d] the jury to unanimously reject\na death sentence before considering other sentencing\nalternatives.\u201d 465 F. 3d, at 709 (citing Maples v. Coyle,\n171 F. 3d 408, 416\u2013417 (CA6 1999)). We have not, how\never, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for\nthis reason. Mills says nothing about the matter. Neither\nthe parties nor the courts below referred to Beck v. Ala\nbama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), or identified any other prece\ndent from this Court setting forth this rule. Cf. Jones v.\nUnited States, 527 U. S. 373, 379\u2013384 (1999) (rejecting an\narguably analogous claim). But see post, at 3\u20135 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). What\never the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict\nforms in this case were we to consider them on direct\nappeal, the jury instructions at Spisak\u2019s trial were not\ncontrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n                            III\n  Spisak\u2019s second claim is that his counsel\u2019s closing argu\nment at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inade\nquate as to violate the Sixth Amendment. To prevail,\nSpisak must show both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a \u201creasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d\nid., at 694.\n  The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak\u2019s claim was\n10                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnot well-taken on the basis of our review of the record.\u201d\nState v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802\n(citing, inter alia, Strickland, supra). The District Court\nconcluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job\nand that \u201c[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability\nthat, absent counsel\u2019s alleged errors, the jury would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201d Spisak v. Coyle,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 204a. The Court of Appeals, how\never, reached a contrary conclusion. It held that counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument, measured by \u201c \u2018an objective standard of\nreasonableness,\u2019 \u201d was inadequate, and it asserted that \u201ca\nreasonable probability exists \u201d that adequate representa\ntion would have led to a different result. 465 F. 3d, at 703,\n706 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688). Responding to the\nState\u2019s petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 terse finding of a \u201creasonable probabil\nity\u201d that a more adequate argument would have changed a\njuror\u2019s vote.\n   In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak\u2019s\ncounsel described Spisak\u2019s killings in some detail. He\nacknowledged that Spisak\u2019s admiration for Hitler inspired\nhis crimes. He portrayed Spisak as \u201csick,\u201d \u201ctwisted,\u201d and\n\u201cdemented.\u201d 8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983). And he said that\nSpisak was \u201cnever going to be any different.\u201d Ibid. He\nthen pointed out that all the experts had testified that\nSpisak suffered from some degree of mental illness. And,\nafter a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his\nown decisions about calling expert witnesses and prepar\ning them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not\nlegally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by\nreason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently men\ntally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he\nshould not be executed. Counsel also told the jury that,\nwhen weighing Spisak\u2019s mental illness against the \u201csub\nstantial\u201d aggravating factors present in the case, id., at\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of \u201cpride\u201d\nfor living in \u201ca humane society\u201d made up of \u201ca humane\npeople,\u201d id., at 2897\u20132900, 2926\u20132928. That humanity,\nhe said, required the jury to weigh the evidence \u201cfairly\u201d\nand to be \u201cloyal to that oath\u201d the jurors had taken to up\nhold the law. Id., at 2926.\n   Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument\nwas constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly\nemphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it\noverly emphasized Spisak\u2019s threats to continue his crimes;\n(3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based\ntheir mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing\nabout any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5)\nit made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict\nagainst death.\n   We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct\nthat the closing argument was inadequate. We neverthe\nless find no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing\nargument without these defects would have made a sig\nnificant difference.\n   Any different, more adequate closing argument would\nhave taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted\nthat he had committed three murders and two other shoot\nings. Spisak\u2019s defense at the guilt phase of the trial con\nsisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not\nguilty by reason of insanity. And counsel, apparently\nhoping to demonstrate Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condi\ntion, called him to the stand.\n   Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace\nRickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford. He also\nadmitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Har\ndaway, and shot at Coletta Dartt. He committed these\ncrimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler,\nwho was Spisak\u2019s \u201cspiritual leader\u201d in a \u201cwar\u201d for \u201csur\nvival\u201d of \u201cthe Aryan people.\u201d 4 id., at 1343\u20131344, 1396\n(July 5, 1983). He said that he had purchased guns and\n12                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstockpiled ammunition to further this war. Id., at 1406\u2013\n1408. And he had hoped to \u201ccreate terror\u201d at Cleveland\nState University, because it was \u201cone of the prime targets\u201d\nwhere the \u201cJews and the system . . . are brainwashing the\nyouth.\u201d Id., at 1426\u20131428.\n   Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot\nRickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a\nsexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom. He\nexpressed satisfaction at having \u201celiminated that particu\nlar threat . . . to me and to the white race.\u201d 5 id., at 1511\n(July 7, 1983). In June he saw a stranger, John Har\ndaway, on a train platform and shot him seven times\nbecause he had been looking for a black person to kill as\n\u201cblood atonement\u201d for a recent crime against two white\nwomen. 4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983). He added that he\nfelt \u201cgood\u201d after shooting Hardaway because he had \u201cac\ncomplished something,\u201d but later felt \u201c[k]ind of bad\u201d when\nhe learned that Hardaway had survived. Id., at 1424\u2013\n1425. In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt be\ncause, he said, he heard her \u201cmaking some derisive re\nmarks about us,\u201d meaning the Nazi Party. Id., at 1432\u2013\n1435. Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy\nSheehan because he \u201cthought he was one of those Jewish\nprofessors . . . that liked to hang around in the men\u2019s room\nand seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that\ngo there.\u201d 5 id., at 1465\u20131466 (July 7, 1983). Spisak\nadded that he was \u201csorry about that\u201d murder because he\nlater learned Sheehan \u201cwasn\u2019t Jewish like I thought he\nwas.\u201d Ibid. And three days later, while on a \u201csearch and\ndestroy mission,\u201d he shot and killed Brian Warford, a\nyoung black man who \u201clooked like he was almost asleep\u201d\nin a bus shelter, to fulfill his \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cinflict the maxi\nmum amount of casualties on the enemies.\u201d Id., at 1454\u2013\n1455, 1478.\n   Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit\nsimilar crimes if he had the chance. He said about War\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nford\u2019s murder that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get caught that time\nbecause I wanted to be able to do it again and again and\nagain and again.\u201d Id., at 1699 (July 8, 1983). In a letter\nwritten to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and\nWarford \u201cthe finest thing I ever did in my whole life\u201d and\nexpressed a wish that he \u201chad a human submachine gun\nright now so I could exterminate\u201d black men \u201cand watch\nthem scream and twitch in agony.\u201d Id., at 1724\u20131725.\nAnd he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would\nescape from jail, \u201cgo out and continue the war I started,\u201d\nand \u201ccontinue to inflict the maximum amount of damage\non the enemies as I am able to do.\u201d Id., at 1780\u20131781.\n  The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak\nwas lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives\nfor these crimes. The State contended instead that the\nshootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such\nas robbery. See id., at 1680, 1816\u20131818.\n  The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by\nreason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused\nto instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded\nexpert testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s mental state. The\ndefense\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a\nreport diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a \u201cschizotypal\npersonality disorder\u201d and an \u201catypical psychotic disorder,\u201d\nand as, at times, \u201cunable to control his impulses to as\nsault.\u201d 6 id., at 1882\u20131883, 1992 (July 11, 1983). His\ntestimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir\ndire, however. On cross-examination, he conceded that he\ncould not say Spisak failed Ohio\u2019s sanity standard at the\ntime of the murders. After Markey made the same conces\nsion before the jury, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s\nrenewed motion to exclude Markey\u2019s testimony and in\nstructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.\nAnd the court excluded the defense\u2019s proffered reports\nfrom other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined\nSpisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met\n14                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes. Id.,\nat 1898\u20131899, 1911\u20131912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July\n12, 1983).\n   During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense\ncounsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified\nthat Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.\nDr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that\nSpisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personal\nity disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid think\ning, gender identification conflict, and emotional instabil\nity. She added that these defects \u201csubstantially impair his\nability to conform himself\u201d to the law\u2019s requirements. 8\nid., at 2428\u20132429, 2430\u20132441 (July 16, 1983). Dr. Kurt\nBertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered\nfrom a schizotypal personality disorder and that \u201cmental\nillness does impair his reason to the extent that he has\nsubstantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial\ninability to refrain.\u201d Id., at 2552\u20132556. Dr. Markey,\nwhose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase,\nagain testified and agreed with the other experts\u2019 diagno\nses. Id., at 2692\u20132693, 2712\u20132713 (July 18, 1983).\n   In light of this background and for the following rea\nsons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in\ndefense counsel\u2019s closing argument raise \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that,\u201d but for the deficient closing, \u201cthe result\nof the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694. We therefore cannot find the Ohio\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim to be an \u201cunreasonable appli\ncation\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately\nfollowing the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had\nfresh in their minds the government\u2019s evidence regarding\nthe killings\u2014which included photographs of the dead\nbodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvivid descriptions of the crimes\u2014as well as Spisak\u2019s boast\nful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit\nfurther acts of violence. We therefore do not see how a\nless descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging\ncomments about Spisak could have made a significant\ndifference.\n   Similarly fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds was the three de\nfense experts\u2019 testimony that Spisak suffered from mental\nillness. The jury had heard the experts explain the spe\ncific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as\nwell as what they had learned of his family background\nand his struggles with gender identity. And the jury had\nheard the experts draw connections between his mental\nillness and the crimes. We do not see how it could have\nmade a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his\nactual argument\u2014which emphasized mental illness as a\nmitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\u2019\ntestimony\u2014by repeating the facts or connections that the\nexperts had just described.\n   Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors\ncounsel might have mentioned. All those he proposes\nessentially consist of aspects of the \u201cmental defect\u201d factor\nthat the defense experts described.\n   Finally, in light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the ju\nrors\u2019 sense of humanity\u2014he used the words \u201chumane\npeople\u201d and \u201chumane society\u201d 10 times at various points in\nthe argument\u2014we cannot find that a more explicit or\nmore elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the\nresult, either alone or together with the other circum\nstances just discussed. Thus, we conclude that there is not\na reasonable probability that a more adequate closing\nargument would have changed the result, and that the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Spisak\u2019s claim was not\n\u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of\u201d Strick\nland. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review\n16                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder \u00a72254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because\nthe Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the ques\ntion whether counsel\u2019s closing argument caused Spisak\nprejudice. That is, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s summary\nrejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court\nrested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was\nnot ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not\nhave made a difference, or (3) both. See State v. Spisak,\n36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802. Spisak argues\nthat, under these circumstances, a federal court should\nnot defer to a state court that may not have decided a\nquestion, but instead should decide the matter afresh.\nLower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to\nSpisak\u2019s. See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F. 3d 330, 334\u2013\n335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225,\n231, 237 (2000) (applying the \u00a72254(d) standard in case\ninvolving a state court\u2019s summary denial of a claim,\nthough not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing\nregarding whether or how \u00a72254(d) applied to a summary\ndecision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606\n(CA3 2002) (Alito, J.)

Liebman, Federal\nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a732.2, pp. 1574\u2013\n1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.). However, we need\nnot decide whether deference under \u00a72254(d)(1) is re\nquired here. With or without such deference, our conclu\nsion is the same.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 558 U.

First, the jury\ninstructions impermissibly required that the jury unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing options. Second, the closing argument of\nSpisak\u2019s counsel was so egregious that it was constitution\nally deficient under any standard. Nevertheless, for the\nreasons set forth in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at\n11\u201315, I agree that these errors did not prejudice Spisak\nand thus he is not entitled to relief.\n                              I\n  The jury instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty\nphase, described in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 6\u20138, are\nfairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the\ndeath penalty is warranted\u2014i.e., whether the aggravating\nfactors outweigh the mitigating factors\u2014before moving on\nto consider whether instead a lesser penalty\u2014i.e., one of\ntwo available life sentences\u2014is appropriate. Consistent\nwith Ohio law at the time of Spisak\u2019s trial,1 the jury was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Ohio no longer uses the type of jury instructions at issue in this\n\ncase. In 1996 the Ohio Supreme Court instructed that \u201c[i]n Ohio, a\n2                         SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ntold that it must reach its decision unanimously. The jury\nwas not instructed on the consequence of their failure to\nagree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to\ndeath. Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described\nthese instructions as \u201cacquittal first\u201d because they would\nhave led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to\n\u201cacquit\u201d the defendant of death\u2014unanimously\u2014before it\ncould give effect to a lesser penalty.\n   Following its prior decision in Davis v. Mitchell, 318\nF. 3d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down \u201cvirtually\nidentical\u201d jury instructions, Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d\n684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty phase were\nimpermissible because they \u201crequire[d] the jury to unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing alternatives,\u201d id., at 709. In Davis, the court\nhad explained that an instruction that requires a capital\njury to \u201cfirst unanimously reject the death penalty before\nit can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual\njury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .\u201d 318\nF. 3d, at 689. The source of this constitutional infirmity,\nthe court decided, was our decision in Mills v. Maryland,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsolitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding\nthat the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the\nmitigating factors. Jurors from this point forward should be so in\nstructed.\u201d State v. Brooks, 75 Ohio St. 3d 148, 162, 661 N. E. 2d 1030,\n1042. Although the Brooks decision signaled a change in Ohio\u2019s capital\njury instructions, it was not a change in state law: One juror had the\npower to prevent a death penalty recommendation before Brooks. See\nState v. Springer, 63 Ohio St. 3d 167, 172, 586 N. E. 2d 96, 100 (1992)\n(holding that an offender must be sentenced to life if the penalty-phase\njury deadlocks). Thus, consistent with our view that \u201caccurate sentenc\ning information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury\u2019s] determina\ntion of whether a defendant shall live or die,\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153, 190 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS,\nJJ.), the Ohio high court laudably improved upon the accuracy of Ohio\ncapital jury instructions in Brooks.\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n486 U. S. 367 (1988). For the reasons cogently examined\nin JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion, ante, at 5\u20139, I agree that\nMills does not clearly establish that the instructions at\nissue were unconstitutional. But, in my view, our decision\nin Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), does.2\n  In Beck we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed \u201cwhen the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d\nId., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that\ntime, the Alabama death penalty statute had been \u201cconsis\ntently construed to preclude any lesser included offense\ninstructions in capital cases.\u201d Id., at 629, n. 3. Thus, the\nAlabama jury was \u201cgiven the choice of either convicting\nthe defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was]\nrequired to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him,\nthus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged\nparticipation in the crime.\u201d Id., at 628\u2013629. Because of\nthe unique features of Alabama\u2019s capital punishment\nsystem,3 Beck\u2019s jury believed that either it had to convict\nBeck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus\nsetting him free. The jury was not presented with the\n\u201cthird option\u201d of convicting him of a noncapital offense,\nthus ensuring that he would receive a substantial pun\nishment but not receive the death penalty. Id., at 642.\nWe concluded that the false choice before the jury\u2014death\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Notably, Beck substantially predates Spisak\u2019s trial and thus my\napplication of Beck obviates any discussion on when federal law is\nestablished for Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\npurposes, see ante, at 3. Regardless, in accordance with the view I\nexpressed in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 379\u2013380 (2000) (opinion\nof STEVENS, J.), I would conclude that our decision in Mills, decided\nbefore Spisak\u2019s conviction became final, is also available to him.\n  3 Under Alabama law, the judge conducts a separate penalty-phase\n\nproceeding after the jury has returned a conviction on a capital offense.\nBeck, 447 U. S., at 629. Thus, the jury reasonably believed that its\nverdict would set the defendant\u2019s punishment at death.\n4                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nor acquit\u2014\u201cintroduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreli\nability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated\nin a capital case.\u201d Id., at 643. In other words,\n    \u201cthe difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it in\n    terjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding\n    process, diverting the jury\u2019s attention from the central\n    issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of\n    proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n    is guilty of a capital crime. Thus, on the one hand, the\n    unavailability of the third option of convicting on a\n    lesser included offense may encourage the jury to con\n    vict for an impermissible reason\u2014its belief that the\n    defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should\n    be punished. On the other hand, the apparently\n    mandatory nature of the death penalty may encour\n    age it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason\u2014\n    that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not de\n    serve death.\u201d Id., at 642\u2013643.\n  Although Beck dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the\nreach of its holding is not so limited. The \u201cthird option\u201d we\ndiscussed in Beck was, plainly, a life sentence. Moreover,\nthe unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing\nscheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the\njury (but not before the judge). Our concern in Beck was\nthat presenting the jury with only two options\u2014death or\nno punishment\u2014introduced a risk of arbitrariness and\nerror into the deliberative process that the Constitution\ncould not abide in the capital context. See Spaziano v.\nFlorida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984) (\u201cThe goal of the Beck\nrule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the\nfactfinding process that is created when the jury is forced\ninto an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and\ninnocence\u201d). We held, therefore, that the jury must be\ngiven a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace\nthe equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence sup\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nports such an option.\n   The acquittal-first jury instructions used during\nSpisak\u2019s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same\nfalse choice that our holding in Beck prohibits. By requir\ning Spisak\u2019s jury to decide first whether the State had met\nits burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach\nthat decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the\njury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third\noption that was before it, namely, a life sentence. Indeed,\nthese instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at\nissue in Beck because they would have led individual\njurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might\nhave resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they\ncould not give effect to their determination that a life\nsentence was appropriate unless and until they had first\nconvinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the\ndeath sentence.\n   Admittedly, Spisak has never identified Beck as the\nsource of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case,\nnor did the courts below cite or rely upon it. But Spisak\nhas consistently pressed his argument in terms that are\nwholly consistent with Beck. On direct appeal he con\ntended, for example, that he:\n    \u201cwas severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms\n    because the jurors were never informed of what would\n    happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous de\n    cision. That may have led to irreparable speculation\n    that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be\n    freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing. Such\n    improper speculation may have led those not in\n    agreement with death to go along with a majority.\n    The jury should have been instructed that if they were\n    unable to unanimously agree to death they must re\n    turn a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the al\n    ternative, the court would impose a life sentence.\u201d\n6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n    Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of\n    Ohio).\nThe untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analo\ngous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described\nin Beck. See also 447 U. S., at 644 (\u201cIt is extremely doubt\nful that juries will understand the full implications of a\nmistrial or will have any confidence that their choice of the\nmistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.\nThus, they could have no assurance that a second trial\nwould end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser\nincluded offense\u201d (footnote omitted)). Spisak and the\nCourt of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instruc\ntions at issue in this case, but in my view Beck provides\nthe proper basis in clearly established federal law to con\nclude the instructions were unconstitutional.\n                               II\n   Petitioner defends Spisak\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument\nas a reasonable strategic decision \u201cto draw the sting out of\nthe prosecution\u2019s argument and gain credibility with the\njury by conceding the weaknesses of his own case.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 37. I agree that such a strategy is generally\na reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy\nunder the difficult circumstances of this case. Even\nSpisak concedes that his counsel \u201cfaced an admittedly\ndifficult case in closing argument in the penalty phase.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 43. But, surely, a strategy can be\nexecuted so poorly as to render even the most reasonable\nof trial tactics constitutionally deficient under Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). And this is such a\ncase.\n   It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious coun\nsel\u2019s closing argument was without reproducing it in its\nentirety.      The Court\u2019s assessment of the closing as\n\u201clengthy and rambling\u201d and its brief description of its\ncontent, see ante, at 10, does not accurately capture the\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Suffice it to say\nthat the argument shares far more in common with a\nprosecutor\u2019s closing than with a criminal defense attor\nney\u2019s. Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it\nwould have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of\nmisconduct. See Brief for Steven Lubet et al. as Amici\nCuriae 15\u201316 (observing that counsel\u2019s closing argument\n\u201cwould have been improper even coming from the prosecu\ntor\u201d).

Similarly, in light of Spisak\u2019s\nconduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating\ncircumstances of the offense, the instructional error was\nalso harmless because it did not have a substantial and\ninjurious effect on this record, Brecht v.

SPISAK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013724.      Argued October 13, 2009\u2014Decided January 12, 2010\nAfter the Ohio courts sentenced respondent Spisak to death and denied\n  his claims on direct appeal and collateral review, he filed a federal\n  habeas petition claiming that, at his trial\u2019s penalty phase, (1) the in\n  structions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to\n  consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to\n  be mitigating, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and (2) his coun\n  sel\u2019s inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assis\n  tance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The\n  District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both\n  arguments and ordered relief.\nHeld:\n    1. Because the state court\u2019s upholding of the mitigation jury in\n structions and forms was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable ap\n plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from\n reaching a contrary decision. The Court of Appeals erred in holding\n that the instructions and forms contravened Mills, in which this\n Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue vio\n lated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that\n it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all\n 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to\n exist, 486 U. S., at 380\u2013381, 384. Even assuming that Mills sets\n forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for reviewing the\n state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here\n differ significantly from those in Mills: They made clear that, to rec\n ommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that\n each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circum\n stances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the exis\n2                            SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously. Nor did they\n    say anything about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make in\n    dividual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance\n    existed. They focused only on the overall question of balancing the\n    aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury\n    to consider all relevant evidence. Thus, the instructions and verdict\n    forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or\n    what they implied, the constitutional error in the Mills instructions.\n    Pp. 2\u20139.\n       2. Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\n    assistance-of-counsel claim was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreason\n    able application\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n    \u00a72254(d)(1). To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, inter alia,\n    that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unpro\n    fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ\n    ent.\u201d Strickland, supra, at 694. Even assuming that the closing ar\n    gument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court\n    finds no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing argument\n    without these defects would have made a significant difference. Any\n    different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in\n    the following context: Spisak\u2019s defense at the trial\u2019s guilt phase con\n    sisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by\n    reason of insanity. Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate\n    Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where\n    he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shoot\n    ings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further mur\n    ders if given the opportunity. In light of this background and for the\n    following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not\n    raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for\n    the deficient closing. First, since the sentencing phase took place\n    immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds\n    the government\u2019s extensive and graphic evidence regarding the kill\n    ings, Spisak\u2019s boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats\n    to commit further violent acts. Second, although counsel did not\n    summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it,\n    and the defense experts\u2019 more detailed testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s\n    mental illness was also fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds. Third, Spisak does\n    not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have men\n    tioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the\n    \u201cmental defect\u201d factor that the defense experts described. Finally, in\n    light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the jurors\u2019 sense of humanity, it\n    is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could\n    have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing\n    circumstances.

Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in\nan Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted\nmurders. He was sentenced to death. He filed a habeas\ncorpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitu\ntional errors occurred at his trial. First, Spisak claimed\nthat the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitu\ntionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only\nthose factors that the jury unanimously found to be miti\ngating. See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).\nSecond, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm\nas a result of his counsel\u2019s inadequate closing argument at\nthe penalty phase of the proceeding. See Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Federal Court of\nAppeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas\nrelief. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                            I\n  In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders\nand two attempted murders at Cleveland State University\nin 1982. The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a\ndeath sentence. The Ohio courts denied Spisak\u2019s claims,\n2                     SMITH v.

E. 2d 719 (1995) (per\ncuriam).\n   Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.\nAmong other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase\nof his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two\nreasons we consider here. The District Court denied his\npetition. Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio,\nApr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. But the Court of\nAppeals accepted Spisak\u2019s two claims, namely, his mitiga\ntion instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d 684, 703\u2013706,\n708\u2013711 (CA6 2006). The Court of Appeals consequently\nordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of\nhabeas corpus forbidding Spisak\u2019s execution. Id., at 715\u2013\n716.\n   The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.\nWe granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U. S. 945 (2007). We\nremanded the case for further consideration in light of two\nrecent cases in which this Court had held that lower fed\neral courts had not properly taken account of the defer\nence federal law grants state-court determinations on\nfederal habeas review. Ibid.; see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d);\nCarey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70 (2006); Schriro v. Landri\ngan, 550 U. S. 465 (2007). On remand, the Sixth Circuit\nreinstated its earlier opinion. Spisak v. Hudson, 512 F. 3d\n852, 853\u2013854 (2008). The State again sought certiorari.\nWe again granted the petition. And we now reverse.\n                             II\n  Spisak\u2019s first claim concerns the instructions and verdict\nforms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial. The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instruc\ntions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instruc\ntions, taken together with the forms, \u201crequire[d]\u201d juror\n\u201cunanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor\u201d\u2014\ncontrary to this Court\u2019s holding in Mills v. Maryland,\nsupra. 465 F. 3d, at 708. Since the parties do not dispute\nthat the Ohio courts \u201cadjudicated\u201d this claim, i.e., they\nconsidered and rejected it \u201con the merits,\u201d the law permits\na federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the\nstate-court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an un\nreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). Unlike the Court of\nAppeals, we conclude that Spisak\u2019s claim does not satisfy\nthis standard.\n   The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that\nMills sets forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal\nlaw.\u201d While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether\nMills was \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for the purpose\nof reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we shall\nassume the same.

Maryland, supra (decided\nJune 6, 1988).\n                             A\n  The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two\nwell-established principles. First, the Constitution forbids\nimposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or\njury is \u201c \u2018 \u201cprecluded from considering, as a mitigating\n4                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfactor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and\nany of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant\nproffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 486\nU. S., at 374 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,\n110 (1982), in turn quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,\n604 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Second, the sentencing\njudge or jury \u201c \u2018 may not refuse to consider or be precluded\nfrom considering \u201cany relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nMills, 486 U. S., at 374\u2013375 (quoting Skipper v. South\nCarolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings,\nsupra, at 114).\n   Applying these principles, the Court held that the jury\ninstructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated\nthe Constitution because, read naturally, they told the\njury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be\nmitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating\ncircumstance had been proved to exist. Mills, 486 U. S., at\n380\u2013381, 384. If, for example, the defense presents evi\ndence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some\njurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some\nonly the second, and some only the third. But if even one\nof the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating\nconsiderations exists, but that he is barred from consider\ning it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held,\nthe Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.\nSee id., at 380, 384; see also McKoy v. North Carolina, 494\nU. S. 433, 442\u2013443 (1990) (\u201cMills requires that each juror\nbe permitted to consider and give effect to . . . all mitigat\ning evidence in deciding . . . whether aggravating circum\nstances outweigh mitigating circumstances . . . \u201d). Because\nthe instructions in Mills would have led a reasonable juror\nto believe the contrary, the Court held that the sentencing\nproceeding violated the Constitution. 486 U. S., at 374\u2013\n375.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

In the Mills sentencing phase, the trial\njudge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had\nthree distinct parts. Section I set forth a list of 10 specific\naggravating circumstances next to which were spaces\nwhere the jury was to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Just above the\nlist, the form said:\n       \u201cBased upon the evidence we unanimously find that\n    each of the following aggravating circumstances which\n    is marked \u2018yes\u2019 has been proven . . . and each aggra\n    vating circumstance which is marked \u2018no\u2019 has not been\n    proven . . . .\u201d 486 U. S., at 384\u2013385 (emphasis added;\n    internal quotation marks omitted).\nSection II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating\ncircumstances (seven specific circumstances and the\neighth designated as \u201cother\u201d) next to which were spaces\nwhere the jury was to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Just above the\nlist the form said:\n       \u201cBased upon the evidence we unanimously find that\n    each of the following mitigating circumstances which\n    is marked \u2018yes\u2019 has been proven to exist . . . and each\n    mitigating circumstance marked \u2018no\u2019 has not been\n    proven . . . .\u201d Id., at 387 (emphasis added; internal\n    quotation marks omitted).\nSection III set forth the overall balancing question, along\nwith spaces for the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d It said:\n       \u201cBased on the evidence we unanimously find that it\n    has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances\n    marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section II outweigh the aggravating\n    circumstances marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section I.\u201d Id., at 388\u2013\n    389 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit\n6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    ted).\n   Explaining the forms, the judge instructed the jury with\nan example. He told the jury that it should mark \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 \u201d\non the jury form if it \u201c \u2018unanimously\u2019 \u201d concluded that an\naggravating circumstance had been proved. Id., at 378.\nOtherwise, he said, \u201c \u2018of course you must answer no.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (emphasis deleted). These instructions, together\nwith the forms, told the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d on Section II\u2019s\nlist of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously\nconcluded that the particular mitigating factor had been\nproved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section\nIII only those mitigating factors marked \u201cyes\u201d in Section\nII. Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that\nit could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravat\ning and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors\nthat the jury had unanimously found to exist. See id., at\n380\u2013381.\n   The instructions and jury forms in this case differ sig\nnificantly from those in Mills. The trial judge instructed\nthe jury that the aggravating factors they would consider\nwere the specifications that the jury had found proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial\u2014\nessentially, that each murder was committed in a course of\nconduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the\nmurders, that the murder was committed with the intent\nto evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.\n8 Tr. 2967\u20132972 (July 19, 1983).\n   He then explained the concept of a \u201cmitigating factor.\u201d\nAfter doing so, he listed examples, including that \u201cthe\ndefendant because of a mental disease or defect . . . lacked\nsubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of\nthe law.\u201d Id., at 2972\u20132973. The court also told the jury\nthat it could take account of \u201cany other\u201d mitigating consid\neration it found \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d Id., at 2973.\nAnd he instructed the jury that the State bore the burden\nof proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Id., at\n2965.\n   With respect to \u201cthe procedure\u201d by which the jury should\nreach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following:\n    \u201c[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant\n    evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony\n    received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.\n    From this you must determine whether, beyond a rea\n    sonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which\n    [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the\n    separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors present in this case.\n      \u201cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stance in each separate count outweighs the mitigat\n    ing factors, then you must return that finding to the\n    Court.\n         .           .           .          .            .\n      \u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the\n    testimony received at this hearing and the arguments\n    of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of com\n    mitting in the separate counts outweigh the\n    mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine\n    which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to\n    recommend to the Court.\u201d Id., at 2973\u20132975.\n  The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each ag\ngravating factor. The first of the two forms said:\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury in this case . . . do find beyond a reason\n    able doubt that the aggravating circumstance . . . was\n8                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present\n\n    in this case.\n\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury recommend that the sentence of death \n\n    be imposed . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 2975\u20132976. \n\nThe other verdict form read:\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury . . . do find that the aggravating circum\n    stances . . . are not sufficient to outweigh the mitiga\n    tion factors present in this case.\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury recommend that the defendant . . . be\n    sentenced to life imprisonment . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 2976.\n   The instructions and forms made clear that, to recom\nmend a death sentence, the jury had to find, unanimously\nand beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the aggravat\ning factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances. But\nthe instructions did not say that the jury must determine\nthe existence of each individual mitigating factor unani\nmously. Neither the instructions nor the forms said any\nthing about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make\nindividual determinations that each particular mitigating\ncircumstance existed. They focused only on the overall\nbalancing question. And the instructions repeatedly told\nthe jury to \u201cconside[r] all of the relevant evidence.\u201d Id., at\n2974. In our view the instructions and verdict forms did\nnot clearly bring about, either through what they said or\nwhat they implied, the circumstance that Mills found\ncritical, namely,\n    \u201ca substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon\n    receiving the judge\u2019s instructions in this case, and in\n    attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,\n    well may have thought they were precluded from con\n    sidering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors\n    agreed on the existence of a particular such circum\n    stance.\u201d 486 U. S., at 384.\nWe consequently conclude that that the state court\u2019s deci\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion upholding these forms and instructions was not \u201ccon\ntrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States\u201d in Mills.          28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury in\nstructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that\nthe instructions \u201crequire[d] the jury to unanimously reject\na death sentence before considering other sentencing\nalternatives.\u201d 465 F. 3d, at 709 (citing Maples v. Coyle,\n171 F. 3d 408, 416\u2013417 (CA6 1999)). We have not, how\never, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for\nthis reason. Mills says nothing about the matter. Neither\nthe parties nor the courts below referred to Beck v. Ala\nbama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), or identified any other prece\ndent from this Court setting forth this rule. Cf. Jones v.\nUnited States, 527 U. S. 373, 379\u2013384 (1999) (rejecting an\narguably analogous claim). But see post, at 3\u20135 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). What\never the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict\nforms in this case were we to consider them on direct\nappeal, the jury instructions at Spisak\u2019s trial were not\ncontrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n                            III\n  Spisak\u2019s second claim is that his counsel\u2019s closing argu\nment at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inade\nquate as to violate the Sixth Amendment. To prevail,\nSpisak must show both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a \u201creasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d\nid., at 694.\n  The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak\u2019s claim was\n10                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnot well-taken on the basis of our review of the record.\u201d\nState v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802\n(citing, inter alia, Strickland, supra). The District Court\nconcluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job\nand that \u201c[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability\nthat, absent counsel\u2019s alleged errors, the jury would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201d Spisak v. Coyle,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 204a. The Court of Appeals, how\never, reached a contrary conclusion. It held that counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument, measured by \u201c \u2018an objective standard of\nreasonableness,\u2019 \u201d was inadequate, and it asserted that \u201ca\nreasonable probability exists \u201d that adequate representa\ntion would have led to a different result. 465 F. 3d, at 703,\n706 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688). Responding to the\nState\u2019s petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 terse finding of a \u201creasonable probabil\nity\u201d that a more adequate argument would have changed a\njuror\u2019s vote.\n   In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak\u2019s\ncounsel described Spisak\u2019s killings in some detail. He\nacknowledged that Spisak\u2019s admiration for Hitler inspired\nhis crimes. He portrayed Spisak as \u201csick,\u201d \u201ctwisted,\u201d and\n\u201cdemented.\u201d 8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983). And he said that\nSpisak was \u201cnever going to be any different.\u201d Ibid. He\nthen pointed out that all the experts had testified that\nSpisak suffered from some degree of mental illness. And,\nafter a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his\nown decisions about calling expert witnesses and prepar\ning them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not\nlegally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by\nreason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently men\ntally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he\nshould not be executed. Counsel also told the jury that,\nwhen weighing Spisak\u2019s mental illness against the \u201csub\nstantial\u201d aggravating factors present in the case, id., at\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of \u201cpride\u201d\nfor living in \u201ca humane society\u201d made up of \u201ca humane\npeople,\u201d id., at 2897\u20132900, 2926\u20132928. That humanity,\nhe said, required the jury to weigh the evidence \u201cfairly\u201d\nand to be \u201cloyal to that oath\u201d the jurors had taken to up\nhold the law. Id., at 2926.\n   Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument\nwas constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly\nemphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it\noverly emphasized Spisak\u2019s threats to continue his crimes;\n(3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based\ntheir mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing\nabout any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5)\nit made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict\nagainst death.\n   We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct\nthat the closing argument was inadequate. We neverthe\nless find no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing\nargument without these defects would have made a sig\nnificant difference.\n   Any different, more adequate closing argument would\nhave taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted\nthat he had committed three murders and two other shoot\nings. Spisak\u2019s defense at the guilt phase of the trial con\nsisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not\nguilty by reason of insanity. And counsel, apparently\nhoping to demonstrate Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condi\ntion, called him to the stand.\n   Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace\nRickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford. He also\nadmitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Har\ndaway, and shot at Coletta Dartt. He committed these\ncrimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler,\nwho was Spisak\u2019s \u201cspiritual leader\u201d in a \u201cwar\u201d for \u201csur\nvival\u201d of \u201cthe Aryan people.\u201d 4 id., at 1343\u20131344, 1396\n(July 5, 1983). He said that he had purchased guns and\n12                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstockpiled ammunition to further this war. Id., at 1406\u2013\n1408. And he had hoped to \u201ccreate terror\u201d at Cleveland\nState University, because it was \u201cone of the prime targets\u201d\nwhere the \u201cJews and the system . . . are brainwashing the\nyouth.\u201d Id., at 1426\u20131428.\n   Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot\nRickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a\nsexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom. He\nexpressed satisfaction at having \u201celiminated that particu\nlar threat . . . to me and to the white race.\u201d 5 id., at 1511\n(July 7, 1983). In June he saw a stranger, John Har\ndaway, on a train platform and shot him seven times\nbecause he had been looking for a black person to kill as\n\u201cblood atonement\u201d for a recent crime against two white\nwomen. 4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983). He added that he\nfelt \u201cgood\u201d after shooting Hardaway because he had \u201cac\ncomplished something,\u201d but later felt \u201c[k]ind of bad\u201d when\nhe learned that Hardaway had survived. Id., at 1424\u2013\n1425. In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt be\ncause, he said, he heard her \u201cmaking some derisive re\nmarks about us,\u201d meaning the Nazi Party. Id., at 1432\u2013\n1435. Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy\nSheehan because he \u201cthought he was one of those Jewish\nprofessors . . . that liked to hang around in the men\u2019s room\nand seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that\ngo there.\u201d 5 id., at 1465\u20131466 (July 7, 1983). Spisak\nadded that he was \u201csorry about that\u201d murder because he\nlater learned Sheehan \u201cwasn\u2019t Jewish like I thought he\nwas.\u201d Ibid. And three days later, while on a \u201csearch and\ndestroy mission,\u201d he shot and killed Brian Warford, a\nyoung black man who \u201clooked like he was almost asleep\u201d\nin a bus shelter, to fulfill his \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cinflict the maxi\nmum amount of casualties on the enemies.\u201d Id., at 1454\u2013\n1455, 1478.\n   Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit\nsimilar crimes if he had the chance. He said about War\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nford\u2019s murder that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get caught that time\nbecause I wanted to be able to do it again and again and\nagain and again.\u201d Id., at 1699 (July 8, 1983). In a letter\nwritten to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and\nWarford \u201cthe finest thing I ever did in my whole life\u201d and\nexpressed a wish that he \u201chad a human submachine gun\nright now so I could exterminate\u201d black men \u201cand watch\nthem scream and twitch in agony.\u201d Id., at 1724\u20131725.\nAnd he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would\nescape from jail, \u201cgo out and continue the war I started,\u201d\nand \u201ccontinue to inflict the maximum amount of damage\non the enemies as I am able to do.\u201d Id., at 1780\u20131781.\n  The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak\nwas lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives\nfor these crimes. The State contended instead that the\nshootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such\nas robbery. See id., at 1680, 1816\u20131818.\n  The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by\nreason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused\nto instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded\nexpert testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s mental state. The\ndefense\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a\nreport diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a \u201cschizotypal\npersonality disorder\u201d and an \u201catypical psychotic disorder,\u201d\nand as, at times, \u201cunable to control his impulses to as\nsault.\u201d 6 id., at 1882\u20131883, 1992 (July 11, 1983). His\ntestimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir\ndire, however. On cross-examination, he conceded that he\ncould not say Spisak failed Ohio\u2019s sanity standard at the\ntime of the murders. After Markey made the same conces\nsion before the jury, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s\nrenewed motion to exclude Markey\u2019s testimony and in\nstructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.\nAnd the court excluded the defense\u2019s proffered reports\nfrom other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined\nSpisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met\n14                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes. Id.,\nat 1898\u20131899, 1911\u20131912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July\n12, 1983).\n   During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense\ncounsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified\nthat Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.\nDr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that\nSpisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personal\nity disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid think\ning, gender identification conflict, and emotional instabil\nity. She added that these defects \u201csubstantially impair his\nability to conform himself\u201d to the law\u2019s requirements. 8\nid., at 2428\u20132429, 2430\u20132441 (July 16, 1983). Dr. Kurt\nBertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered\nfrom a schizotypal personality disorder and that \u201cmental\nillness does impair his reason to the extent that he has\nsubstantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial\ninability to refrain.\u201d Id., at 2552\u20132556. Dr. Markey,\nwhose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase,\nagain testified and agreed with the other experts\u2019 diagno\nses. Id., at 2692\u20132693, 2712\u20132713 (July 18, 1983).\n   In light of this background and for the following rea\nsons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in\ndefense counsel\u2019s closing argument raise \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that,\u201d but for the deficient closing, \u201cthe result\nof the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694. We therefore cannot find the Ohio\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim to be an \u201cunreasonable appli\ncation\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately\nfollowing the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had\nfresh in their minds the government\u2019s evidence regarding\nthe killings\u2014which included photographs of the dead\nbodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvivid descriptions of the crimes\u2014as well as Spisak\u2019s boast\nful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit\nfurther acts of violence. We therefore do not see how a\nless descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging\ncomments about Spisak could have made a significant\ndifference.\n   Similarly fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds was the three de\nfense experts\u2019 testimony that Spisak suffered from mental\nillness. The jury had heard the experts explain the spe\ncific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as\nwell as what they had learned of his family background\nand his struggles with gender identity. And the jury had\nheard the experts draw connections between his mental\nillness and the crimes. We do not see how it could have\nmade a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his\nactual argument\u2014which emphasized mental illness as a\nmitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\u2019\ntestimony\u2014by repeating the facts or connections that the\nexperts had just described.\n   Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors\ncounsel might have mentioned. All those he proposes\nessentially consist of aspects of the \u201cmental defect\u201d factor\nthat the defense experts described.\n   Finally, in light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the ju\nrors\u2019 sense of humanity\u2014he used the words \u201chumane\npeople\u201d and \u201chumane society\u201d 10 times at various points in\nthe argument\u2014we cannot find that a more explicit or\nmore elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the\nresult, either alone or together with the other circum\nstances just discussed. Thus, we conclude that there is not\na reasonable probability that a more adequate closing\nargument would have changed the result, and that the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Spisak\u2019s claim was not\n\u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of\u201d Strick\nland. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review\n16                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder \u00a72254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because\nthe Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the ques\ntion whether counsel\u2019s closing argument caused Spisak\nprejudice. That is, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s summary\nrejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court\nrested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was\nnot ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not\nhave made a difference, or (3) both. See State v. Spisak,\n36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802. Spisak argues\nthat, under these circumstances, a federal court should\nnot defer to a state court that may not have decided a\nquestion, but instead should decide the matter afresh.\nLower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to\nSpisak\u2019s. See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F. 3d 330, 334\u2013\n335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225,\n231, 237 (2000) (applying the \u00a72254(d) standard in case\ninvolving a state court\u2019s summary denial of a claim,\nthough not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing\nregarding whether or how \u00a72254(d) applied to a summary\ndecision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606\n(CA3 2002) (Alito, J.)

Liebman, Federal\nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a732.2, pp. 1574\u2013\n1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.). However, we need\nnot decide whether deference under \u00a72254(d)(1) is re\nquired here. With or without such deference, our conclu\nsion is the same.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 558 U.

FRANK G.\n\n                 SPISAK, JR. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [January 12, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment.\n  In my judgment the Court of Appeals correctly con\ncluded that two errors that occurred during Spisak\u2019s trial\nviolated clearly established federal law. First, the jury\ninstructions impermissibly required that the jury unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing options. Second, the closing argument of\nSpisak\u2019s counsel was so egregious that it was constitution\nally deficient under any standard. Nevertheless, for the\nreasons set forth in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at\n11\u201315, I agree that these errors did not prejudice Spisak\nand thus he is not entitled to relief.\n                              I\n  The jury instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty\nphase, described in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 6\u20138, are\nfairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the\ndeath penalty is warranted\u2014i.e., whether the aggravating\nfactors outweigh the mitigating factors\u2014before moving on\nto consider whether instead a lesser penalty\u2014i.e., one of\ntwo available life sentences\u2014is appropriate. Consistent\nwith Ohio law at the time of Spisak\u2019s trial,1 the jury was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Ohio no longer uses the type of jury instructions at issue in this\n\ncase. In 1996 the Ohio Supreme Court instructed that \u201c[i]n Ohio, a\n2                         SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ntold that it must reach its decision unanimously. The jury\nwas not instructed on the consequence of their failure to\nagree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to\ndeath. Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described\nthese instructions as \u201cacquittal first\u201d because they would\nhave led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to\n\u201cacquit\u201d the defendant of death\u2014unanimously\u2014before it\ncould give effect to a lesser penalty.\n   Following its prior decision in Davis v. Mitchell, 318\nF. 3d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down \u201cvirtually\nidentical\u201d jury instructions, Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d\n684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty phase were\nimpermissible because they \u201crequire[d] the jury to unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing alternatives,\u201d id., at 709. In Davis, the court\nhad explained that an instruction that requires a capital\njury to \u201cfirst unanimously reject the death penalty before\nit can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual\njury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .\u201d 318\nF. 3d, at 689. The source of this constitutional infirmity,\nthe court decided, was our decision in Mills v. Maryland,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsolitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding\nthat the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the\nmitigating factors. Jurors from this point forward should be so in\nstructed.\u201d State v.

Thus, consistent with our view that \u201caccurate sentenc\ning information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury\u2019s] determina\ntion of whether a defendant shall live or die,\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153, 190 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS,\nJJ.), the Ohio high court laudably improved upon the accuracy of Ohio\ncapital jury instructions in Brooks.\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n486 U. S. 367 (1988). For the reasons cogently examined\nin JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion, ante, at 5\u20139, I agree that\nMills does not clearly establish that the instructions at\nissue were unconstitutional. But, in my view, our decision\nin Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), does.2\n  In Beck we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed \u201cwhen the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d\nId., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that\ntime, the Alabama death penalty statute had been \u201cconsis\ntently construed to preclude any lesser included offense\ninstructions in capital cases.\u201d Id., at 629, n. 3. Thus, the\nAlabama jury was \u201cgiven the choice of either convicting\nthe defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was]\nrequired to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him,\nthus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged\nparticipation in the crime.\u201d Id., at 628\u2013629. Because of\nthe unique features of Alabama\u2019s capital punishment\nsystem,3 Beck\u2019s jury believed that either it had to convict\nBeck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus\nsetting him free. The jury was not presented with the\n\u201cthird option\u201d of convicting him of a noncapital offense,\nthus ensuring that he would receive a substantial pun\nishment but not receive the death penalty. Id., at 642.\nWe concluded that the false choice before the jury\u2014death\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Notably, Beck substantially predates Spisak\u2019s trial and thus my\napplication of Beck obviates any discussion on when federal law is\nestablished for Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\npurposes, see ante, at 3. Regardless, in accordance with the view I\nexpressed in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 379\u2013380 (2000) (opinion\nof STEVENS, J.), I would conclude that our decision in Mills, decided\nbefore Spisak\u2019s conviction became final, is also available to him.\n  3 Under Alabama law, the judge conducts a separate penalty-phase\n\nproceeding after the jury has returned a conviction on a capital offense.\nBeck, 447 U. S., at 629. Thus, the jury reasonably believed that its\nverdict would set the defendant\u2019s punishment at death.\n4                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nor acquit\u2014\u201cintroduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreli\nability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated\nin a capital case.\u201d Id., at 643. In other words,\n    \u201cthe difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it in\n    terjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding\n    process, diverting the jury\u2019s attention from the central\n    issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of\n    proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n    is guilty of a capital crime. Thus, on the one hand, the\n    unavailability of the third option of convicting on a\n    lesser included offense may encourage the jury to con\n    vict for an impermissible reason\u2014its belief that the\n    defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should\n    be punished. On the other hand, the apparently\n    mandatory nature of the death penalty may encour\n    age it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason\u2014\n    that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not de\n    serve death.\u201d Id., at 642\u2013643.\n  Although Beck dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the\nreach of its holding is not so limited. The \u201cthird option\u201d we\ndiscussed in Beck was, plainly, a life sentence. Moreover,\nthe unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing\nscheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the\njury (but not before the judge). Our concern in Beck was\nthat presenting the jury with only two options\u2014death or\nno punishment\u2014introduced a risk of arbitrariness and\nerror into the deliberative process that the Constitution\ncould not abide in the capital context.

S. 447, 455 (1984) (\u201cThe goal of the Beck\nrule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the\nfactfinding process that is created when the jury is forced\ninto an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and\ninnocence\u201d). We held, therefore, that the jury must be\ngiven a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace\nthe equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence sup\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nports such an option.\n   The acquittal-first jury instructions used during\nSpisak\u2019s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same\nfalse choice that our holding in Beck prohibits. By requir\ning Spisak\u2019s jury to decide first whether the State had met\nits burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach\nthat decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the\njury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third\noption that was before it, namely, a life sentence. Indeed,\nthese instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at\nissue in Beck because they would have led individual\njurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might\nhave resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they\ncould not give effect to their determination that a life\nsentence was appropriate unless and until they had first\nconvinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the\ndeath sentence.\n   Admittedly, Spisak has never identified Beck as the\nsource of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case,\nnor did the courts below cite or rely upon it. But Spisak\nhas consistently pressed his argument in terms that are\nwholly consistent with Beck. On direct appeal he con\ntended, for example, that he:\n    \u201cwas severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms\n    because the jurors were never informed of what would\n    happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous de\n    cision. That may have led to irreparable speculation\n    that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be\n    freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing. Such\n    improper speculation may have led those not in\n    agreement with death to go along with a majority.\n    The jury should have been instructed that if they were\n    unable to unanimously agree to death they must re\n    turn a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the al\n    ternative, the court would impose a life sentence.\u201d\n6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n    Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of\n    Ohio).\nThe untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analo\ngous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described\nin Beck. See also 447 U. S., at 644 (\u201cIt is extremely doubt\nful that juries will understand the full implications of a\nmistrial or will have any confidence that their choice of the\nmistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.\nThus, they could have no assurance that a second trial\nwould end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser\nincluded offense\u201d (footnote omitted)). Spisak and the\nCourt of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instruc\ntions at issue in this case, but in my view Beck provides\nthe proper basis in clearly established federal law to con\nclude the instructions were unconstitutional.\n                               II\n   Petitioner defends Spisak\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument\nas a reasonable strategic decision \u201cto draw the sting out of\nthe prosecution\u2019s argument and gain credibility with the\njury by conceding the weaknesses of his own case.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 37. I agree that such a strategy is generally\na reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy\nunder the difficult circumstances of this case. Even\nSpisak concedes that his counsel \u201cfaced an admittedly\ndifficult case in closing argument in the penalty phase.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 43. But, surely, a strategy can be\nexecuted so poorly as to render even the most reasonable\nof trial tactics constitutionally deficient under Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). And this is such a\ncase.\n   It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious coun\nsel\u2019s closing argument was without reproducing it in its\nentirety.      The Court\u2019s assessment of the closing as\n\u201clengthy and rambling\u201d and its brief description of its\ncontent, see ante, at 10, does not accurately capture the\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ncatastrophe of counsel\u2019s failed strategy. Suffice it to say\nthat the argument shares far more in common with a\nprosecutor\u2019s closing than with a criminal defense attor\nney\u2019s. Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it\nwould have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of\nmisconduct. See Brief for Steven Lubet et al. as Amici\nCuriae 15\u201316 (observing that counsel\u2019s closing argument\n\u201cwould have been improper even coming from the prosecu\ntor\u201d). A few examples are in order.\n  Presumably to take the \u201csting\u201d out of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase, Brief for Petitioner 37, counsel described his client\u2019s\nacts in vivid detail to the jury:\n     \u201c[Y]ou can smell almost the blood. You can smell, if\n     you will, the urine. You are in a bathroom, and it is\n     death, and you can smell the death . . . and you can\n     feel, the loneliness of that railroad platform . . . and\n     we can all know the terror that [the victim] felt when\n     he turned and looked into those thick glasses and\n     looked into the muzzle of a gun that kept spitting out\n     bullets . . . And we can see a relatively young man cut\n     down with so many years to live, and we could re\n     member his widow, and we certainly can remember\n     looking at his children . . . There are too many family\n     albums. There are too many family portraits dated\n     1982 that have too many empty spaces. And there is\n     too much terror left in the hearts of those that we call\n     lucky.\u201d4 465 F. 3d, at 704\u2013795 (internal quotation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 To make matters worse, these graphic and emotionally charged\n\ndescriptions of Spisak\u2019s crimes were irrelevant under state law even for\npurposes of the State\u2019s case for aggravating circumstances.

Don\u2019t look for good thoughts, because he has\n     none. He is sick, he is twisted. He is demented, and\n     he is never going to be any different.\u201d 465 F. 3d, at\n     705 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   And then the strategy really broke down: At no point\ndid counsel endeavor to direct his negative statements\nabout his client toward an express appeal for leniency.5\nOn the contrary, counsel concluded by telling the jury that\n\u201cwhatever you do, we are going to be proud of you,\u201d ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted), which I take to mean\nthat, in counsel\u2019s view, \u201ceither outcome, death or life,\nwould be a valid conclusion,\u201d ibid.\n   Spisak\u2019s crimes, and the seemingly unmitigated hatred\nmotivating their commission, were truly awful. But that\ndoes not excuse a lawyer\u2019s duty to represent his client\nwithin the bounds of prevailing professional norms. The\nmere fact that counsel, laudably, may have had a \u201cstrat\negy\u201d to build rapport with the jury and lessen the impact\nof the prosecution\u2019s case, does not excuse counsel\u2019s utter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\naggravating circumstances but not including heinous circumstances of\noffense).\n   5 Counsel did attempt to appeal to the jury\u2019s sense of humanity, per\n\nhaps implicitly suggesting that humane people do not condemn others,\nespecially those with mental illness, to death.

In short, counsel\u2019s argument grossly\ntransgressed the bounds of what constitutionally compe\ntent counsel would have done in a similar situation.\n                             III\n   Notwithstanding these two serious constitutional errors,\nI agree with the Court that these errors do not entitle\nSpisak to relief. As JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s discussion in Part\nIII makes vividly clear, see ante, at 11\u201314, Spisak\u2019s own\nconduct alienated and ostracized the jury, and his crimes\nwere monstrous. In my judgment even the most skillful of\nclosing arguments\u2014even one befitting Clarence Darrow\u2014\nwould not have created a reasonable probability of a dif\nferent outcome in this case. Similarly, in light of Spisak\u2019s\nconduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating\ncircumstances of the offense, the instructional error was\nalso harmless because it did not have a substantial and\ninjurious effect on this record, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507\nU. S. 619, 623 (1993).\n   Accordingly, I concur in the judgment and concur in the\nCourt\u2019s discussion of prejudice in Part III of its opinion.\n</pre>",
