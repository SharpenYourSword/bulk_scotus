Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), we held\nthat a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a\nfederal judge finds that \u201cupon the record evidence adduced\nat the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof\nof guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 324. A Nevada\njury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented\nincluded DNA evidence matching respondent\u2019s DNA pro\nfile. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a\nDNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal\nDistrict Court applied the Jackson standard and granted\nthe writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. Brown v.\nFarwell, 525 F. 3d 787 (CA9 2008). We granted certiorari\nto consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.\nBecause the trial record includes both the DNA evidence\nand other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that\nthey clearly did.\n                            I\n  Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe\nwas brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer. Respon\ndent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime. During and\n2                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsince his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his\ninnocence.1 He was, however, admittedly intoxicated\nwhen the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the fol\nlowing morning he told a friend \u201c \u2018he wished that he could\nremember what did go on or what went on.\u2019 \u201d App. 309.\n  Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in\nthe same trailer park. Their brother Trent and his wife\nRaquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the\nstreet from Jane Doe\u2019s. Both Troy and Trent were ac\nquainted with Jane Doe\u2019s family; Troy had visited Jane\nDoe\u2019s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis.\nThe evening of the attack, Jane\u2019s mother, Pam, took Jane\nto Raquel and Trent\u2019s trailer to babysit while the three\nadults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent\nreturned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about\n9:30 p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and\nplaying pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock\nLounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister\nwere home alone because he answered the phone at\nthe bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that\nevening.\n  Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by\nbeer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself\nwhile he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at\nabout 12:15 a.m. Jane called her mother to report the\nrape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have\ntaken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,\nTroy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He\nwas wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin\njacket, and boots. Two witnesses saw a man dressed in\ndark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stum\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 He\n       denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that\nthe police had found his fingerprints in Jane\u2019s bedroom, and he even\ndenied involvement when the sentencing judge told him that accep\ntance of responsibility would garner him leniency.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nbling in the road between the two trailers shortly after\n1 a.m.\n   The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and\nJane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.\nWhen asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned\nboth Troy and his brother Trent. Several days after the\nrape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as\nher assailant but then stated that the man who had sent\nflowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had\nsent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify\nTroy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could\nnot identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape,\nhowever, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a\nblack jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also\nvividly remembered that the man \u201cstunk real, real bad\u201d of\n\u201ccologne, or some beer or puke or something.\u201d Id., at 172\u2013\n173.\n   Some evidence besides Jane\u2019s inconsistent identification\ndid not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she\nhad bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite\nmarks on his hands when examined by a police officer\napproximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated\nthat her assailant\u2019s jacket had a zipper (Troy\u2019s did not)\nand that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi\ntionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy\nleft the Peacock and when Pam received Jane\u2019s call report\ning the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling\nbetween the two trailers reported a bright green logo on\nthe back of the jacket, but Troy\u2019s jacket had a yellow and\norange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a\nnight light on when she went to bed, the police suspected\nthe assailant had turned off the light. The only usable\nfingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy\u2019s and\nthe police did not find Troy\u2019s fingerprints in the trailer.\n   Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The\npolice recovered semen from Jane\u2019s underwear and from\n4                       MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe rape kit. The State\u2019s expert, Renee Romero, tested the\nformer and determined that the DNA matched Troy\u2019s and\nthat the probability another person from the general\npopulation would share the same DNA (the \u201crandom\nmatch probability\u201d) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy\u2019s coun\nsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he\nconsulted with an expert in advance who found no prob\nlems with Romero\u2019s test procedures. At some time before\nsentencing, Troy\u2019s family had additional DNA testing\ndone. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit\nmatched Troy\u2019s DNA, with a random match probability of\n1 in 10,000.\n   The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen\ntenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10\nyears.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court\nconsidered Troy\u2019s claim that his conviction was not sup\nported by sufficient evidence, analyzing \u201cwhether the jury,\nacting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy\u2019s]\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Brown v. Nevada, 113\nNev. 275, 285, 934 P. 2d 235, 241 (1997) (per curiam). The\ncourt rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt\nas follows:\n      \u201cTestimony indicated that Troy left the bar around\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Under\n          Nevada law at the time of the trial, the jury, rather than the\njudge, imposed the sentence for a sexual assault crime if it found the\nassault resulted in substantial bodily harm. Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial\nbodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without\nthe possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10\nyears. \u00a7200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The\njudge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years\non a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada\nSupreme Court reversed Troy\u2019s conviction for one count of child abuse\non double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second\nsexual assault count. Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 934 P. 2d 235\n(1997) (per curiam). On resentencing, the judge imposed the same\nsentence as before.\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n    12:15 a.m., that Troy lived relatively close to the bar,\n    and that Troy lived very close to Jane Doe. Troy had\n    enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe\u2019s house\n    and to assault Jane Doe before she made the tele\n    phone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.\n    While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her\n    description of his clothing was similar to what Troy\n    was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled\n    like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy\n    had been drinking beer and had vomited several times\n    that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that\n    Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave\n    him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,\n    [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resem\n    bling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling\n    in the road near Jane Doe\u2019s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy\n    also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,\n    arguably to remove the blood evidence from his\n    clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that se\n    men collected from Jane Doe\u2019s underwear matched\n    Troy\u2019s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had\n    matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1\n    in 10,000 people had matching DNA).\u201d Ibid., 934\n    P. 2d, at 241\u2013242.\nRespondent also argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine\nwhether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found\nrespondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and\nconcluded there was no plain error in the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to conduct a hearing. Id., at 284, 934 P. 2d, at 241.\n   In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief,\nclaiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitu\ntionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of\nthe DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number\nof foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that\n6                   MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nif trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been\nexcluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted\nthat because trial counsel \u201ctotally failed to challenge the\nDNA evidence in the case,\u201d counsel \u201cfailed to preserve\nvalid issues for appeal.\u201d App. 1101. The state postconvic\ntion court denied relief, id., at 1489\u20131499, and the Nevada\nSupreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500\u20131506.\n   Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,\nclaiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on\nthe sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an\nunreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a\ntypical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that\nthe totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial\nwas constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of\nthe evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy\nsis. In particular, he argued that Romero\u2019s testimony\nrelated to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli\nable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized\nthe random match probability and misstated the probabil\nity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that\ntestimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence\nto convict him.\n   In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro\nmero\u2019s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared\nby Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution\nary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple\nmented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it\nwas not presented to any state court, because \u201cthe thesis\nof the report was argued during post-conviction.\u201d Brown\nv. Farwell, No. 3:03\u2013cv\u201300712\u2013PMP\u2013VPC, 2006 WL\n6181129, *5, n. 2 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).\n   Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set\naside the \u201cunreliable DNA testimony\u201d and held that with\nout the DNA evidence \u201ca reasonable doubt would exist in\nthe mind of any rational trier of fact.\u201d Id., at *7.

The court\nheld the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied\nJackson. 525 F. 3d, at 798; see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\nThe Court of Appeals first reasoned \u201cthe admission of\nRomero\u2019s unreliable and misleading testimony violated\nTroy\u2019s due process rights,\u201d so the District Court was cor\nrect to exclude it. 525 F. 3d, at 797. It then \u201cweighed the\nsufficiency of the remaining evidence,\u201d including the Dis\ntrict Court\u2019s \u201ccatalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies\nthat would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy\u2019s guilt in\nthe mind of any rational juror.\u201d Ibid. In light of the\n\u201cstark\u201d conflicts in the evidence and the State\u2019s concession\nthat there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA\nevidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable\nfor the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent\u2019s\ninsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. Id., at 798.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider\ntwo questions: the proper standard of review for a Jackson\nclaim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may\nrely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the\nreliability of trial evidence.\n                           II\n  Respondent\u2019s claim has now crystallized into a claim\nabout the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testi\nmony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the\nMueller Report. The Mueller Report does not challenge\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The District Court also granted habeas relief on respondent\u2019s claim\n\nthat he was denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to his\nattorney\u2019s handling of the DNA evidence and failure to adequately\ninvestigate the victim\u2019s stepfather as an alternative suspect. Brown v.\nFarwell, No. 3:03\u2013cv\u201300712\u2013PMP\u2013VPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *9\u2013*10\n(Nev., Dec. 14, 2006). The Court of Appeals did not consider those\nclaims on appeal and they are not now before us.\n8                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nRomero\u2019s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any\nof the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends\nthat Romero committed the so-called \u201cprosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d\nand that she underestimated the probability of a DNA\nmatch between respondent and one of his brothers.\n  The prosecutor\u2019s fallacy is the assumption that the\nrandom match probability is the same as the probability\nthat the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.\nSee Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic\nScience, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133\n(1996) (\u201cLet P equal the probability of a match, given the\nevidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the\nprobability that the DNA at the crime scene came from\nsomeone other than the defendant\u201d). In other words, if a\njuror is told the probability a member of the general popu\nlation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random\nmatch probability), and he takes that to mean there is\nonly a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the\ndefendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime\nscene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the\nprosecutor\u2019s fallacy. It is further error to equate source\nprobability with probability of guilt, unless there is no\nexplanation other than guilt for a person to be the source\nof crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in\nan erroneous statement that, based on a random match\nprobability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de\nfendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is\nguilty.\n  The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero\u2019s opinion\nthat only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA\nprofile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how\never, that some of Romero\u2019s testimony\u2014as well as the\nprosecutor\u2019s argument\u2014suggested that the evidence also\nestablished that there was only a .000033% chance that\nrespondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.\nBrief for Petitioners 54. For example, the prosecutor\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nargued at closing the jury could be \u201c99.999967 percent\nsure\u201d in this case. App. 730. And when the prosecutor\nasked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat\ning source probability with random match probability,\nwhether \u201cit [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that\nthe DNA found in the panties\u2014the semen in the panties\u2014\nand the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy\nBrown would be .000033,\u201d id., at 460, Romero ultimately\nagreed that it was \u201cnot inaccurate\u201d to state it that way,\nid., at 461\u2013462.\n   Looking at Romero\u2019s testimony as a whole, though, she\nalso indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe\nmatical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per\ncentage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent\nages, she answered affirmatively the court\u2019s question\nwhether the percentage was \u201cthe same math just ex\npressed differently.\u201d Id., at 462. She pointed out that the\nprobability a brother would match was greater than the\nrandom match probability, which also indicated to the jury\nthat the random match probability is not the same as the\nlikelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of\nthe DNA.\n   The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero\u2019s\ntestimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more\nof Troy\u2019s brothers\u2019 DNA would match. Romero testified\nthere was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one\nbrother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at\n469, 472. When asked whether \u201cthat change[s] at all with\ntwo brothers,\u201d she answered no. Id., at 472. According to\nMueller, Romero\u2019s analysis was misleading in two re\nspects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par\nents under which siblings have the lowest chance of\nmatching that is biologically possible, but even under this\nstingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers\nmatching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024\nunder her assumption). Second, using the assumptions\n10                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nMueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single\nsibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability\nthat among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in\n132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.\n  In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns\nare testimony equating random match probability with\nsource probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood\nthat one of Troy\u2019s brothers would also match the DNA left\nat the scene.\n                              III\n   Although we granted certiorari to review respondent\u2019s\nJackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 resolution of his claim under Jackson was in\nerror. See Brief for Respondent 2\u20133; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals\ndid not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead\nresolved the question whether admission of Romero\u2019s\ninaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally\nunfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether\nthat error was harmless.\n   Although both petitioners and respondent are now\naligned on the same side of the questions presented for our\nreview, the case is not moot because \u201cthe parties continue\nto seek different relief\u201d from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele\nphone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Respondent primarily argues\nthat we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or\nremand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process\nclaim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993). The State, on the\nother hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and one\namicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as\nimprovidently granted, Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27\u201328, but\nwe think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Pacific Bell, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the Dis\ntrict Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of\nevaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35,\nand concedes the \u201cpurpose of a Jackson analysis is to\ndetermine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in\nreturning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,\nnot whether improper evidence violated due process,\u201d id.,\nat 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of\nit was excluded. Respondent\u2019s concession thus disposes of\nhis Jackson claim. The concession is also clearly correct.\nAn \u201cappellate court\u2019s reversal for insufficiency of the evi\ndence is in effect a determination that the government\u2019s\ncase against the defendant was so lacking that the trial\ncourt should have entered a judgment of acquittal.\u201d Lock\nhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988). Because reversal\nfor insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judg\nment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. See\nBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978). To \u201cmake\nthe analogy complete\u201d between a reversal for insufficiency\nof the evidence and the trial court\u2019s granting a judgment of\nacquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, \u201ca reviewing court\nmust consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial\ncourt,\u201d regardless whether that evidence was admitted\nerroneously, id., at 41.\n   Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a review\ning court must consider all of the evidence admitted at\ntrial when considering a Jackson claim. Even if we set\nthat concession aside, however, and assume that the Court\nof Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in\nthe context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egre\ngious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s\nrejection of respondent\u2019s insufficiency-of-the-evidence\nclaim \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly\n12                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nestablished Federal law,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).4\n   Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it,\nthe Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely ex\ncluding the DNA evidence or Romero\u2019s testimony from\nthat court\u2019s consideration. The Report did not contest that\nthe DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence\nremains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the\nState concedes Romero overstated its probative value by\nfailing to dispel the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy. And Mueller\u2019s\nclaim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underes\ntimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers\nindicates that two experts do not agree with one another,\nnot that Romero\u2019s estimates were unreliable.5\n   Mueller\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe chance that among four\nbrothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,\u201d App. 1583,\nis substantially different from Romero\u2019s estimate of a 1 in\n6,500 chance that one brother would match. But even if\nRomero\u2019s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury\nverdict is not undermined. First, the estimate that is\nmore pertinent to this case is 1 in 132\u2014the probability of a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Jackson. The Court of\nAppeals held the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d\nJackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a\n\u201creasonable\u201d jury, not a \u201crational\u201d one, and that assesses whether the\njury could have been convinced of a defendant\u2019s guilt, rather than\nwhether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 794\u2013795 (CA9 2008). It is of little\nmoment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a \u201creason\nable\u201d jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather\nthan asking whether a \u201crational\u201d one could be convinced of each ele\nment of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt\nunless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  5 The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have\n\ncriticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 53\u201354. We need not pass on the relative credibility of\nthe two experts because even assuming that Mueller\u2019s estimate is\ncorrect, respondent\u2019s claim fails.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Second, although Jane Doe men\ntioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby\ntrailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were\nsober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.\nEven under Mueller\u2019s odds, a rational jury could consider\nthe DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.\n   Furthermore, the Court of Appeals\u2019 discussion of the\nnon-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review\nthat Jackson and \u00a72254(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas\ncourt can only set aside a state-court decision as \u201can un\nreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal\nlaw,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), if the state court\u2019s application of that\nlaw is \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 409 (2000). And Jackson requires a reviewing\ncourt to review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution.\u201d 443 U. S., at 319. Expressed more fully,\nthis means a reviewing court \u201cfaced with a record of his\ntorical facts that supports conflicting inferences must\npresume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the\nrecord\u2014that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolu\ntion.\u201d Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,\n330 (1995) (\u201cThe Jackson standard . . . looks to whether\nthere is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could sup\nport the conviction\u201d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat it must review the evidence in the light most favor\nable to the prosecution, but the court\u2019s recitation of incon\nsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.\n   For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony\nregarding when Troy left the Peacock. 525 F. 3d, at 797.\nIt is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one\nbartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy\nwould have left the bar after the attack occurred. Yet the\njury could have credited a different bartender\u2019s testimony\nthat Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m. Resolving\n14                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have\nfound that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant. It\nis undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately\nupon returning home. The court notes this is \u201cplausibly\nconsistent with him being the assailant\u201d but also that he\nprovided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.\nIbid. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecu\ntion, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed\nthe clothes immediately to clean blood from them.\n    To be sure, the court\u2019s Jackson analysis relied substan\ntially upon a concession made by the State in state post\nconviction proceedings that \u201cabsent the DNA findings,\nthere was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the\ncrime.\u201d App. 1180. But that concession posited a situation\nin which there was no DNA evidence at all,6 not a situa\ntion in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA\nevidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 analysis failed to preserve \u201cthe factfinder\u2019s role as\nweigher of the evidence\u201d by reviewing \u201call of the evidence\n. . . in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d Jack\nson, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the\nNevada Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the Jackson claim\nwas objectively unreasonable.\n                            IV\n  Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consid\neration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm\non an alternative ground. He contends the two errors \u201cin\ndescribing the statistical meaning\u201d of the DNA evidence\nrendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which\n\nrespondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the\nadmissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of grounds\u2014including\nRomero\u2019s qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow\nthe proper testing protocol\u2014and might have successfully excluded the\nDNA evidence altogether.

Because the\nNinth Circuit held that \u201cthe admission of Romero\u2019s unreli\nable and misleading testimony violated [respondent\u2019s] due\nprocess rights,\u201d 525 F. 3d, at 797, and in respondent\u2019s view\nmerely applied Jackson (erroneously) to determine\nwhether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the\njudgment below on the basis of what he calls his \u201cDNA due\nprocess\u201d claim, Brief for Respondent 35.\n  As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this\nclaim, he would have to show that the state court\u2019s adjudi\ncation of the claim was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unrea\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The clearly established law he\npoints us to is Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114\n(1977), in which we held that when the police have used a\nsuggestive eyewitness identification procedure, \u201creliability\nis the linchpin in determining\u201d whether an eyewitness\nidentification may be admissible, with reliability deter\nmined according to factors set out in Neil v. Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188 (1972). Respondent argues that the admission of\nthe inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite be\ncause the testimony was \u201cidentification testimony,\u201d 432\nU. S., at 114, was \u201cunnecessarily suggestive,\u201d id., at 113,\nand was unreliable.\n  Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for\nthe very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.\nRespondent did not present his new \u201cDNA due process\u201d\nclaim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consis\ntently argued that Romero\u2019s testimony should be excluded\nfrom the Jackson analysis simply because it was \u201cunreli\nable\u201d and that the due process violation occurred because\nthe remaining evidence was insufficient to convict. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (\u201c[Respondent] asserts . . . that\nthe DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have\nbeen admitted at his trial.

In the Ninth Circuit, too, respondent presented\nonly his Jackson claim,7 and it is, at the least, unclear\nwhether respondent presented his newly minted due\nprocess claim in the state courts.8 Recognizing that his\nJackson claim cannot prevail, respondent tries to rewrite\nhis federal habeas petition. His attempt comes too late,\nhowever, and he cannot now start over.\n                        *     *    *\n  We have stated before that \u201cDNA testing can provide\npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v.

The State acknowledges that Romero committed\nthe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy, Brief for Petitioners 54, and the\nMueller Report suggests that Romero\u2019s testimony may\nhave been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match\nwith one of respondent\u2019s brothers. Regardless, ample\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court of Appeals did reason that Romero\u2019s testimony must be\n\nexcluded from the Jackson analysis on due process grounds. 525 F. 3d,\nat 797. But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim\nrespondent did make in his federal habeas petition under Jackson. It is\nclear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider\u2014and did not pass\nupon\u2014the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a\ndecision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), or any other\nclearly established law regarding due process other than Jackson.\n  8 The State contends the claim is either not exhausted or procedurally\n\ndefaulted. The State has objected from the beginning that respondent\ndid not raise a due process claim regarding the reliability of the DNA\nevidence in state court. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a\u2013183a. Respon\ndent consistently answered the State\u2019s exhaustion objection by arguing\nhe presented his Jackson claim in the Nevada Supreme Court. See\nApp. 1521\u20131526. The Ninth Circuit held respondent exhausted his\ninsufficiency claim. 525 F. 3d, at 793.

Nelson, 488 U. S.\n33, 41 (1988)); see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307\n(1979). I write separately because I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s decision to complicate its analysis with an exten\nsive discussion of the Mueller Report. See ante, at 7\u201313.\nDefense counsel commissioned that report 11 years after\nrespondent\u2019s trial. See ante, at 1. Accordingly, the re\nport\u2019s attacks on the State\u2019s DNA testimony were not part\nof the trial evidence and have no place in the Jackson\ninquiry. See Jackson, supra, at 318; Lockhart, supra, at\n40\u201342. That is all we need or should say about the report\nin deciding this case.\n  The Court\u2019s opinion demonstrates as much. The Court\u2019s\nlengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, see ante, at 7\u2013\n10, is merely a predicate to asserting that \u201ceven if\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals could have considered the report in its\nJackson analysis, the report \u201cprovided no warrant for\nentirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero\u2019s testi\n2                       MCDANIEL v.

Based on these observations, the\nCourt concludes that the Mueller Report did not under\nmine the State\u2019s DNA tests as \u201cpowerful inculpatory evi\ndence.\u201d Ibid. That is true, but even if the report had\ncompletely undermined the DNA evidence\u2014which the\nNinth Circuit may have mistakenly believed it did, see\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 795\u2013796 (2008)\u2014the\npanel still would have erred in considering the report to\nresolve respondent\u2019s Jackson claim. The reason, as the\nCourt reaffirms, is that Jackson claims must be decided\nsolely on the evidence adduced at trial. See ante, at 11.\nAccordingly, the Court need not correct any erroneous\nimpressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning\nthe report\u2019s impact on the State\u2019s DNA evidence to resolve\nrespondent\u2019s Jackson claim.* Because that is the only\nclaim properly before us, I do not join the Court\u2019s dicta\nabout how the Mueller Report\u2019s findings could affect a\nconstitutional analysis to which we have long held such\npost-trial evidence does not apply. See Jackson, supra, at\n318.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Correcting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s apparent misconception of the effects\nof the Mueller Report is the only plausible reason for the Court\u2019s\ndecision to explain that the report would not have undermined the\nState\u2019s DNA results \u201ceven if\u201d the Court of Appeals could have consid\nered it in resolving respondent\u2019s Jackson claim. Ante, at 11\u201312. That\ndiscussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are\ncircumstances in which post-trial evidence would \u201cwarrant\u201d excluding\nDNA trial evidence from a Jackson analysis, ante, at 12, or that courts\napplying Jackson may consider post-trial evidence for any other pur\npose. Both points are squarely foreclosed by the precedents on which\nthe Court relies in reversing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment. See ante, at\n1 (citing Jackson, v. Virginia, 443 U.

A Nevada\njury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented\nincluded DNA evidence matching respondent\u2019s DNA pro\nfile. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a\nDNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal\nDistrict Court applied the Jackson standard and granted\nthe writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. Brown v.\nFarwell, 525 F. 3d 787 (CA9 2008). We granted certiorari\nto consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.\nBecause the trial record includes both the DNA evidence\nand other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that\nthey clearly did.\n                            I\n  Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe\nwas brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer. Respon\ndent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime. During and\n2                      MCDANIEL v.

Their brother Trent and his wife\nRaquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the\nstreet from Jane Doe\u2019s. Both Troy and Trent were ac\nquainted with Jane Doe\u2019s family; Troy had visited Jane\nDoe\u2019s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis.\nThe evening of the attack, Jane\u2019s mother, Pam, took Jane\nto Raquel and Trent\u2019s trailer to babysit while the three\nadults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent\nreturned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about\n9:30 p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and\nplaying pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock\nLounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister\nwere home alone because he answered the phone at\nthe bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that\nevening.\n  Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by\nbeer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself\nwhile he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at\nabout 12:15 a.m. Jane called her mother to report the\nrape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have\ntaken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,\nTroy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He\nwas wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin\njacket, and boots.

It was Trent and Raquel who had\nsent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify\nTroy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could\nnot identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape,\nhowever, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a\nblack jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also\nvividly remembered that the man \u201cstunk real, real bad\u201d of\n\u201ccologne, or some beer or puke or something.\u201d Id., at 172\u2013\n173.\n   Some evidence besides Jane\u2019s inconsistent identification\ndid not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she\nhad bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite\nmarks on his hands when examined by a police officer\napproximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated\nthat her assailant\u2019s jacket had a zipper (Troy\u2019s did not)\nand that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi\ntionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy\nleft the Peacock and when Pam received Jane\u2019s call report\ning the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling\nbetween the two trailers reported a bright green logo on\nthe back of the jacket, but Troy\u2019s jacket had a yellow and\norange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a\nnight light on when she went to bed, the police suspected\nthe assailant had turned off the light. The only usable\nfingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy\u2019s and\nthe police did not find Troy\u2019s fingerprints in the trailer.\n   Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The\npolice recovered semen from Jane\u2019s underwear and from\n4                       MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe rape kit. The State\u2019s expert, Renee Romero, tested the\nformer and determined that the DNA matched Troy\u2019s and\nthat the probability another person from the general\npopulation would share the same DNA (the \u201crandom\nmatch probability\u201d) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy\u2019s coun\nsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he\nconsulted with an expert in advance who found no prob\nlems with Romero\u2019s test procedures. At some time before\nsentencing, Troy\u2019s family had additional DNA testing\ndone. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit\nmatched Troy\u2019s DNA, with a random match probability of\n1 in 10,000.\n   The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen\ntenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10\nyears.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court\nconsidered Troy\u2019s claim that his conviction was not sup\nported by sufficient evidence, analyzing \u201cwhether the jury,\nacting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy\u2019s]\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Brown v.

Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial\nbodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without\nthe possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10\nyears. \u00a7200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The\njudge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years\non a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada\nSupreme Court reversed Troy\u2019s conviction for one count of child abuse\non double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second\nsexual assault count. Brown v.

Troy had\n    enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe\u2019s house\n    and to assault Jane Doe before she made the tele\n    phone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.\n    While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her\n    description of his clothing was similar to what Troy\n    was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled\n    like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy\n    had been drinking beer and had vomited several times\n    that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that\n    Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave\n    him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,\n    [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resem\n    bling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling\n    in the road near Jane Doe\u2019s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy\n    also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,\n    arguably to remove the blood evidence from his\n    clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that se\n    men collected from Jane Doe\u2019s underwear matched\n    Troy\u2019s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had\n    matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1\n    in 10,000 people had matching DNA).\u201d Ibid., 934\n    P. 2d, at 241\u2013242.\nRespondent also argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine\nwhether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found\nrespondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and\nconcluded there was no plain error in the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to conduct a hearing. Id., at 284, 934 P. 2d, at 241.\n   In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief,\nclaiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitu\ntionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of\nthe DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number\nof foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that\n6                   MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nif trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been\nexcluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted\nthat because trial counsel \u201ctotally failed to challenge the\nDNA evidence in the case,\u201d counsel \u201cfailed to preserve\nvalid issues for appeal.\u201d App. 1101. The state postconvic\ntion court denied relief, id., at 1489\u20131499, and the Nevada\nSupreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500\u20131506.\n   Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,\nclaiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on\nthe sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an\nunreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a\ntypical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that\nthe totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial\nwas constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of\nthe evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy\nsis. In particular, he argued that Romero\u2019s testimony\nrelated to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli\nable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized\nthe random match probability and misstated the probabil\nity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that\ntestimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence\nto convict him.\n   In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro\nmero\u2019s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared\nby Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution\nary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple\nmented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it\nwas not presented to any state court, because \u201cthe thesis\nof the report was argued during post-conviction.\u201d Brown\nv.

In light of the\n\u201cstark\u201d conflicts in the evidence and the State\u2019s concession\nthat there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA\nevidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable\nfor the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent\u2019s\ninsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.

The Court of Appeals did not consider those\nclaims on appeal and they are not now before us.\n8                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nRomero\u2019s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any\nof the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends\nthat Romero committed the so-called \u201cprosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d\nand that she underestimated the probability of a DNA\nmatch between respondent and one of his brothers.\n  The prosecutor\u2019s fallacy is the assumption that the\nrandom match probability is the same as the probability\nthat the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.\nSee Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic\nScience, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133\n(1996) (\u201cLet P equal the probability of a match, given the\nevidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the\nprobability that the DNA at the crime scene came from\nsomeone other than the defendant\u201d). In other words, if a\njuror is told the probability a member of the general popu\nlation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random\nmatch probability), and he takes that to mean there is\nonly a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the\ndefendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime\nscene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the\nprosecutor\u2019s fallacy. It is further error to equate source\nprobability with probability of guilt, unless there is no\nexplanation other than guilt for a person to be the source\nof crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in\nan erroneous statement that, based on a random match\nprobability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de\nfendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is\nguilty.\n  The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero\u2019s opinion\nthat only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA\nprofile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how\never, that some of Romero\u2019s testimony\u2014as well as the\nprosecutor\u2019s argument\u2014suggested that the evidence also\nestablished that there was only a .000033% chance that\nrespondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.\nBrief for Petitioners 54. For example, the prosecutor\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

And when the prosecutor\nasked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat\ning source probability with random match probability,\nwhether \u201cit [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that\nthe DNA found in the panties\u2014the semen in the panties\u2014\nand the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy\nBrown would be .000033,\u201d id., at 460, Romero ultimately\nagreed that it was \u201cnot inaccurate\u201d to state it that way,\nid., at 461\u2013462.\n   Looking at Romero\u2019s testimony as a whole, though, she\nalso indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe\nmatical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per\ncentage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent\nages, she answered affirmatively the court\u2019s question\nwhether the percentage was \u201cthe same math just ex\npressed differently.\u201d Id., at 462. She pointed out that the\nprobability a brother would match was greater than the\nrandom match probability, which also indicated to the jury\nthat the random match probability is not the same as the\nlikelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of\nthe DNA.\n   The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero\u2019s\ntestimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more\nof Troy\u2019s brothers\u2019 DNA would match. Romero testified\nthere was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one\nbrother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at\n469, 472. When asked whether \u201cthat change[s] at all with\ntwo brothers,\u201d she answered no. Id., at 472. According to\nMueller, Romero\u2019s analysis was misleading in two re\nspects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par\nents under which siblings have the lowest chance of\nmatching that is biologically possible, but even under this\nstingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers\nmatching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024\nunder her assumption). Second, using the assumptions\n10                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nMueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single\nsibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability\nthat among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in\n132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.\n  In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns\nare testimony equating random match probability with\nsource probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood\nthat one of Troy\u2019s brothers would also match the DNA left\nat the scene.\n                              III\n   Although we granted certiorari to review respondent\u2019s\nJackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 resolution of his claim under Jackson was in\nerror. See Brief for Respondent 2\u20133; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals\ndid not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead\nresolved the question whether admission of Romero\u2019s\ninaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally\nunfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether\nthat error was harmless.\n   Although both petitioners and respondent are now\naligned on the same side of the questions presented for our\nreview, the case is not moot because \u201cthe parties continue\nto seek different relief\u201d from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele\nphone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).

Respondent and one\namicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as\nimprovidently granted, Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27\u201328, but\nwe think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Pacific Bell, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the Dis\ntrict Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of\nevaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35,\nand concedes the \u201cpurpose of a Jackson analysis is to\ndetermine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in\nreturning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,\nnot whether improper evidence violated due process,\u201d id.,\nat 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of\nit was excluded. Respondent\u2019s concession thus disposes of\nhis Jackson claim. The concession is also clearly correct.\nAn \u201cappellate court\u2019s reversal for insufficiency of the evi\ndence is in effect a determination that the government\u2019s\ncase against the defendant was so lacking that the trial\ncourt should have entered a judgment of acquittal.\u201d Lock\nhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988). Because reversal\nfor insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judg\nment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. See\nBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978). To \u201cmake\nthe analogy complete\u201d between a reversal for insufficiency\nof the evidence and the trial court\u2019s granting a judgment of\nacquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, \u201ca reviewing court\nmust consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial\ncourt,\u201d regardless whether that evidence was admitted\nerroneously, id., at 41.\n   Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a review\ning court must consider all of the evidence admitted at\ntrial when considering a Jackson claim. Even if we set\nthat concession aside, however, and assume that the Court\nof Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in\nthe context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egre\ngious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s\nrejection of respondent\u2019s insufficiency-of-the-evidence\nclaim \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly\n12                      MCDANIEL v.

C. \u00a72254(d)(1).4\n   Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it,\nthe Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely ex\ncluding the DNA evidence or Romero\u2019s testimony from\nthat court\u2019s consideration. The Report did not contest that\nthe DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence\nremains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the\nState concedes Romero overstated its probative value by\nfailing to dispel the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy. And Mueller\u2019s\nclaim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underes\ntimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers\nindicates that two experts do not agree with one another,\nnot that Romero\u2019s estimates were unreliable.5\n   Mueller\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe chance that among four\nbrothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,\u201d App. 1583,\nis substantially different from Romero\u2019s estimate of a 1 in\n6,500 chance that one brother would match. But even if\nRomero\u2019s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury\nverdict is not undermined. First, the estimate that is\nmore pertinent to this case is 1 in 132\u2014the probability of a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Jackson. The Court of\nAppeals held the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d\nJackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a\n\u201creasonable\u201d jury, not a \u201crational\u201d one, and that assesses whether the\njury could have been convinced of a defendant\u2019s guilt, rather than\nwhether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 794\u2013795 (CA9 2008). It is of little\nmoment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a \u201creason\nable\u201d jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather\nthan asking whether a \u201crational\u201d one could be convinced of each ele\nment of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt\nunless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  5 The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have\n\ncriticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 53\u201354. We need not pass on the relative credibility of\nthe two experts because even assuming that Mueller\u2019s estimate is\ncorrect, respondent\u2019s claim fails.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Second, although Jane Doe men\ntioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby\ntrailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were\nsober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.\nEven under Mueller\u2019s odds, a rational jury could consider\nthe DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.\n   Furthermore, the Court of Appeals\u2019 discussion of the\nnon-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review\nthat Jackson and \u00a72254(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas\ncourt can only set aside a state-court decision as \u201can un\nreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal\nlaw,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), if the state court\u2019s application of that\nlaw is \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 409 (2000). And Jackson requires a reviewing\ncourt to review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution.\u201d 443 U. S., at 319. Expressed more fully,\nthis means a reviewing court \u201cfaced with a record of his\ntorical facts that supports conflicting inferences must\npresume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the\nrecord\u2014that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolu\ntion.\u201d Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,\n330 (1995) (\u201cThe Jackson standard . . . looks to whether\nthere is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could sup\nport the conviction\u201d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat it must review the evidence in the light most favor\nable to the prosecution, but the court\u2019s recitation of incon\nsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.\n   For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony\nregarding when Troy left the Peacock. 525 F. 3d, at 797.\nIt is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one\nbartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy\nwould have left the bar after the attack occurred. Yet the\njury could have credited a different bartender\u2019s testimony\nthat Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m. Resolving\n14                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have\nfound that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant. It\nis undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately\nupon returning home. The court notes this is \u201cplausibly\nconsistent with him being the assailant\u201d but also that he\nprovided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.\nIbid. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecu\ntion, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed\nthe clothes immediately to clean blood from them.\n    To be sure, the court\u2019s Jackson analysis relied substan\ntially upon a concession made by the State in state post\nconviction proceedings that \u201cabsent the DNA findings,\nthere was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the\ncrime.\u201d App. 1180. But that concession posited a situation\nin which there was no DNA evidence at all,6 not a situa\ntion in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA\nevidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 analysis failed to preserve \u201cthe factfinder\u2019s role as\nweigher of the evidence\u201d by reviewing \u201call of the evidence\n. . . in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d Jack\nson, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the\nNevada Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the Jackson claim\nwas objectively unreasonable.\n                            IV\n  Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consid\neration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm\non an alternative ground. He contends the two errors \u201cin\ndescribing the statistical meaning\u201d of the DNA evidence\nrendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which\n\nrespondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the\nadmissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of grounds\u2014including\nRomero\u2019s qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow\nthe proper testing protocol\u2014and might have successfully excluded the\nDNA evidence altogether.

Because the\nNinth Circuit held that \u201cthe admission of Romero\u2019s unreli\nable and misleading testimony violated [respondent\u2019s] due\nprocess rights,\u201d 525 F. 3d, at 797, and in respondent\u2019s view\nmerely applied Jackson (erroneously) to determine\nwhether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the\njudgment below on the basis of what he calls his \u201cDNA due\nprocess\u201d claim, Brief for Respondent 35.\n  As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this\nclaim, he would have to show that the state court\u2019s adjudi\ncation of the claim was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unrea\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The clearly established law he\npoints us to is Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114\n(1977), in which we held that when the police have used a\nsuggestive eyewitness identification procedure, \u201creliability\nis the linchpin in determining\u201d whether an eyewitness\nidentification may be admissible, with reliability deter\nmined according to factors set out in Neil v. Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188 (1972). Respondent argues that the admission of\nthe inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite be\ncause the testimony was \u201cidentification testimony,\u201d 432\nU. S., at 114, was \u201cunnecessarily suggestive,\u201d id., at 113,\nand was unreliable.\n  Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for\nthe very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.\nRespondent did not present his new \u201cDNA due process\u201d\nclaim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consis\ntently argued that Romero\u2019s testimony should be excluded\nfrom the Jackson analysis simply because it was \u201cunreli\nable\u201d and that the due process violation occurred because\nthe remaining evidence was insufficient to convict. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (\u201c[Respondent] asserts . . . that\nthe DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have\nbeen admitted at his trial. If so, then, . . . the state pre\nsented insufficient evidence at trial to prove [respondent]\n16                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nguilty\u201d). In the Ninth Circuit, too, respondent presented\nonly his Jackson claim,7 and it is, at the least, unclear\nwhether respondent presented his newly minted due\nprocess claim in the state courts.8 Recognizing that his\nJackson claim cannot prevail, respondent tries to rewrite\nhis federal habeas petition. His attempt comes too late,\nhowever, and he cannot now start over.\n                        *     *    *\n  We have stated before that \u201cDNA testing can provide\npowerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\u201d\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os\nborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Given the\npersuasiveness of such evidence in the eyes of the jury, it\nis important that it be presented in a fair and reliable\nmanner. The State acknowledges that Romero committed\nthe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy, Brief for Petitioners 54, and the\nMueller Report suggests that Romero\u2019s testimony may\nhave been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match\nwith one of respondent\u2019s brothers. Regardless, ample\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court of Appeals did reason that Romero\u2019s testimony must be\n\nexcluded from the Jackson analysis on due process grounds. 525 F. 3d,\nat 797. But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim\nrespondent did make in his federal habeas petition under Jackson. It is\nclear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider\u2014and did not pass\nupon\u2014the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a\ndecision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), or any other\nclearly established law regarding due process other than Jackson.\n  8 The State contends the claim is either not exhausted or procedurally\n\ndefaulted. The State has objected from the beginning that respondent\ndid not raise a due process claim regarding the reliability of the DNA\nevidence in state court. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a\u2013183a. Respon\ndent consistently answered the State\u2019s exhaustion objection by arguing\nhe presented his Jackson claim in the Nevada Supreme Court. See\nApp. 1521\u20131526. The Ninth Circuit held respondent exhausted his\ninsufficiency claim. 525 F. 3d, at 793. The court had no occasion to\nconsider whether respondent exhausted any due process claim other\nthan his Jackson claim.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

The Court of Appeals did not consider,\nhowever, the ineffective-assistance claims on which the\nDistrict Court also granted respondent habeas relief.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Nelson, 488 U. S.\n33, 41 (1988)); see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307\n(1979). I write separately because I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s decision to complicate its analysis with an exten\nsive discussion of the Mueller Report. See ante, at 7\u201313.\nDefense counsel commissioned that report 11 years after\nrespondent\u2019s trial. See ante, at 1. Accordingly, the re\nport\u2019s attacks on the State\u2019s DNA testimony were not part\nof the trial evidence and have no place in the Jackson\ninquiry. See Jackson, supra, at 318; Lockhart, supra, at\n40\u201342. That is all we need or should say about the report\nin deciding this case.\n  The Court\u2019s opinion demonstrates as much. The Court\u2019s\nlengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, see ante, at 7\u2013\n10, is merely a predicate to asserting that \u201ceven if\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals could have considered the report in its\nJackson analysis, the report \u201cprovided no warrant for\nentirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero\u2019s testi\n2                       MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmony from that court\u2019s consideration\u201d because the report\n\u201cdid not contest that the DNA evidence matched Troy\u201d or\notherwise show that the State\u2019s DNA estimates were\n\u201cunreliable,\u201d ante, at 12. Based on these observations, the\nCourt concludes that the Mueller Report did not under\nmine the State\u2019s DNA tests as \u201cpowerful inculpatory evi\ndence.\u201d Ibid. That is true, but even if the report had\ncompletely undermined the DNA evidence\u2014which the\nNinth Circuit may have mistakenly believed it did, see\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 795\u2013796 (2008)\u2014the\npanel still would have erred in considering the report to\nresolve respondent\u2019s Jackson claim. The reason, as the\nCourt reaffirms, is that Jackson claims must be decided\nsolely on the evidence adduced at trial. See ante, at 11.\nAccordingly, the Court need not correct any erroneous\nimpressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning\nthe report\u2019s impact on the State\u2019s DNA evidence to resolve\nrespondent\u2019s Jackson claim.* Because that is the only\nclaim properly before us, I do not join the Court\u2019s dicta\nabout how the Mueller Report\u2019s findings could affect a\nconstitutional analysis to which we have long held such\npost-trial evidence does not apply. See Jackson, supra, at\n318.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Correcting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s apparent misconception of the effects\nof the Mueller Report is the only plausible reason for the Court\u2019s\ndecision to explain that the report would not have undermined the\nState\u2019s DNA results \u201ceven if\u201d the Court of Appeals could have consid\nered it in resolving respondent\u2019s Jackson claim. Ante, at 11\u201312. That\ndiscussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are\ncircumstances in which post-trial evidence would \u201cwarrant\u201d excluding\nDNA trial evidence from a Jackson analysis, ante, at 12, or that courts\napplying Jackson may consider post-trial evidence for any other pur\npose. Both points are squarely foreclosed by the precedents on which\nthe Court relies in reversing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment. See ante, at\n1 (citing Jackson, v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979)); ante, at 11\n(citing Lockhart, v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988)), respectively.\n</pre>",
