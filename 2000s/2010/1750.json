Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), we held\nthat a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a\nfederal judge finds that “upon the record evidence adduced\nat the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof\nof guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 324. A Nevada\njury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented\nincluded DNA evidence matching respondent’s DNA pro\nfile. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a\nDNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal\nDistrict Court applied the Jackson standard and granted\nthe writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. Brown v.\nFarwell, 525 F. 3d 787 (CA9 2008). We granted certiorari\nto consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.\nBecause the trial record includes both the DNA evidence\nand other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that\nthey clearly did.\n                            I\n  Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe\nwas brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer. Respon\ndent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime. During and\n2                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsince his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his\ninnocence.1 He was, however, admittedly intoxicated\nwhen the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the fol\nlowing morning he told a friend “ ‘he wished that he could\nremember what did go on or what went on.’ ” App. 309.\n  Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in\nthe same trailer park. Their brother Trent and his wife\nRaquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the\nstreet from Jane Doe’s. Both Troy and Trent were ac\nquainted with Jane Doe’s family; Troy had visited Jane\nDoe’s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis.\nThe evening of the attack, Jane’s mother, Pam, took Jane\nto Raquel and Trent’s trailer to babysit while the three\nadults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent\nreturned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about\n9:30 p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and\nplaying pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock\nLounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister\nwere home alone because he answered the phone at\nthe bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that\nevening.\n  Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by\nbeer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself\nwhile he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at\nabout 12:15 a.m. Jane called her mother to report the\nrape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have\ntaken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,\nTroy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He\nwas wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin\njacket, and boots. Two witnesses saw a man dressed in\ndark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stum\n\n——————\n    1 He\n       denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that\nthe police had found his fingerprints in Jane’s bedroom, and he even\ndenied involvement when the sentencing judge told him that accep\ntance of responsibility would garner him leniency.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Several days after the\nrape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as\nher assailant but then stated that the man who had sent\nflowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had\nsent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify\nTroy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could\nnot identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape,\nhowever, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a\nblack jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also\nvividly remembered that the man “stunk real, real bad” of\n“cologne, or some beer or puke or something.” Id., at 172–\n173.\n   Some evidence besides Jane’s inconsistent identification\ndid not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she\nhad bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite\nmarks on his hands when examined by a police officer\napproximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated\nthat her assailant’s jacket had a zipper (Troy’s did not)\nand that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi\ntionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy\nleft the Peacock and when Pam received Jane’s call report\ning the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling\nbetween the two trailers reported a bright green logo on\nthe back of the jacket, but Troy’s jacket had a yellow and\norange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a\nnight light on when she went to bed, the police suspected\nthe assailant had turned off the light. The only usable\nfingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy’s and\nthe police did not find Troy’s fingerprints in the trailer.\n   Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The\npolice recovered semen from Jane’s underwear and from\n4                       MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe rape kit. The State’s expert, Renee Romero, tested the\nformer and determined that the DNA matched Troy’s and\nthat the probability another person from the general\npopulation would share the same DNA (the “random\nmatch probability”) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy’s coun\nsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he\nconsulted with an expert in advance who found no prob\nlems with Romero’s test procedures. At some time before\nsentencing, Troy’s family had additional DNA testing\ndone. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit\nmatched Troy’s DNA, with a random match probability of\n1 in 10,000.\n   The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen\ntenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10\nyears.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court\nconsidered Troy’s claim that his conviction was not sup\nported by sufficient evidence, analyzing “whether the jury,\nacting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy’s]\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown v.

Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial\nbodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without\nthe possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10\nyears. §200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The\njudge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years\non a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada\nSupreme Court reversed Troy’s conviction for one count of child abuse\non double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second\nsexual assault count. Brown v.

Troy had\n    enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe’s house\n    and to assault Jane Doe before she made the tele\n    phone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.\n    While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her\n    description of his clothing was similar to what Troy\n    was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled\n    like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy\n    had been drinking beer and had vomited several times\n    that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that\n    Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave\n    him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,\n    [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resem\n    bling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling\n    in the road near Jane Doe’s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy\n    also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,\n    arguably to remove the blood evidence from his\n    clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that se\n    men collected from Jane Doe’s underwear matched\n    Troy’s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had\n    matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1\n    in 10,000 people had matching DNA).” Ibid., 934\n    P. 2d, at 241–242.\nRespondent also argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine\nwhether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found\nrespondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and\nconcluded there was no plain error in the trial court’s\nfailure to conduct a hearing. Id., at 284, 934 P. 2d, at 241.\n   In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief,\nclaiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitu\ntionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of\nthe DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number\nof foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that\n6                   MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nif trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been\nexcluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted\nthat because trial counsel “totally failed to challenge the\nDNA evidence in the case,” counsel “failed to preserve\nvalid issues for appeal.” App. 1101. The state postconvic\ntion court denied relief, id., at 1489–1499, and the Nevada\nSupreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500–1506.\n   Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,\nclaiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on\nthe sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an\nunreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a\ntypical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that\nthe totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial\nwas constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of\nthe evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy\nsis. In particular, he argued that Romero’s testimony\nrelated to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli\nable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized\nthe random match probability and misstated the probabil\nity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that\ntestimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence\nto convict him.\n   In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro\nmero’s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared\nby Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution\nary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple\nmented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it\nwas not presented to any state court, because “the thesis\nof the report was argued during post-conviction.” Brown\nv.

The court\nheld the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied\nJackson. 525 F. 3d, at 798; see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\nThe Court of Appeals first reasoned “the admission of\nRomero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated\nTroy’s due process rights,” so the District Court was cor\nrect to exclude it. 525 F. 3d, at 797. It then “weighed the\nsufficiency of the remaining evidence,” including the Dis\ntrict Court’s “catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies\nthat would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy’s guilt in\nthe mind of any rational juror.” Ibid. In light of the\n“stark” conflicts in the evidence and the State’s concession\nthat there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA\nevidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable\nfor the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent’s\ninsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. Id., at 798.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider\ntwo questions: the proper standard of review for a Jackson\nclaim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may\nrely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the\nreliability of trial evidence.\n                           II\n  Respondent’s claim has now crystallized into a claim\nabout the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testi\nmony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the\nMueller Report.

The Court of Appeals did not consider those\nclaims on appeal and they are not now before us.\n8                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nRomero’s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any\nof the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends\nthat Romero committed the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy”\nand that she underestimated the probability of a DNA\nmatch between respondent and one of his brothers.\n  The prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the\nrandom match probability is the same as the probability\nthat the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.\nSee Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic\nScience, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133\n(1996) (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the\nevidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the\nprobability that the DNA at the crime scene came from\nsomeone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a\njuror is told the probability a member of the general popu\nlation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random\nmatch probability), and he takes that to mean there is\nonly a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the\ndefendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime\nscene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the\nprosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source\nprobability with probability of guilt, unless there is no\nexplanation other than guilt for a person to be the source\nof crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in\nan erroneous statement that, based on a random match\nprobability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de\nfendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is\nguilty.\n  The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero’s opinion\nthat only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA\nprofile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how\never, that some of Romero’s testimony—as well as the\nprosecutor’s argument—suggested that the evidence also\nestablished that there was only a .000033% chance that\nrespondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.\nBrief for Petitioners 54. For example, the prosecutor\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nargued at closing the jury could be “99.999967 percent\nsure” in this case. App. 730. And when the prosecutor\nasked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat\ning source probability with random match probability,\nwhether “it [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that\nthe DNA found in the panties—the semen in the panties—\nand the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy\nBrown would be .000033,” id., at 460, Romero ultimately\nagreed that it was “not inaccurate” to state it that way,\nid., at 461–462.\n   Looking at Romero’s testimony as a whole, though, she\nalso indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe\nmatical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per\ncentage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent\nages, she answered affirmatively the court’s question\nwhether the percentage was “the same math just ex\npressed differently.” Id., at 462. She pointed out that the\nprobability a brother would match was greater than the\nrandom match probability, which also indicated to the jury\nthat the random match probability is not the same as the\nlikelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of\nthe DNA.\n   The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero’s\ntestimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more\nof Troy’s brothers’ DNA would match. Romero testified\nthere was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one\nbrother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at\n469, 472. When asked whether “that change[s] at all with\ntwo brothers,” she answered no. Id., at 472. According to\nMueller, Romero’s analysis was misleading in two re\nspects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par\nents under which siblings have the lowest chance of\nmatching that is biologically possible, but even under this\nstingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers\nmatching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024\nunder her assumption). Second, using the assumptions\n10                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nMueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single\nsibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability\nthat among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in\n132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.\n  In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns\nare testimony equating random match probability with\nsource probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood\nthat one of Troy’s brothers would also match the DNA left\nat the scene.\n                              III\n   Although we granted certiorari to review respondent’s\nJackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of\nAppeals’ resolution of his claim under Jackson was in\nerror. See Brief for Respondent 2–3; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals\ndid not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead\nresolved the question whether admission of Romero’s\ninaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally\nunfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether\nthat error was harmless.\n   Although both petitioners and respondent are now\naligned on the same side of the questions presented for our\nreview, the case is not moot because “the parties continue\nto seek different relief” from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele\nphone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Respondent primarily argues\nthat we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or\nremand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process\nclaim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993). The State, on the\nother hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and one\namicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as\nimprovidently granted, Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27–28, but\nwe think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nof Appeals’ application of Jackson. Cf. Pacific Bell, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the Dis\ntrict Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of\nevaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35,\nand concedes the “purpose of a Jackson analysis is to\ndetermine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in\nreturning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,\nnot whether improper evidence violated due process,” id.,\nat 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of\nit was excluded. Respondent’s concession thus disposes of\nhis Jackson claim. The concession is also clearly correct.\nAn “appellate court’s reversal for insufficiency of the evi\ndence is in effect a determination that the government’s\ncase against the defendant was so lacking that the trial\ncourt should have entered a judgment of acquittal.” Lock\nhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988). Because reversal\nfor insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judg\nment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. See\nBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978). To “make\nthe analogy complete” between a reversal for insufficiency\nof the evidence and the trial court’s granting a judgment of\nacquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, “a reviewing court\nmust consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial\ncourt,” regardless whether that evidence was admitted\nerroneously, id., at 41.\n   Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a review\ning court must consider all of the evidence admitted at\ntrial when considering a Jackson claim. Even if we set\nthat concession aside, however, and assume that the Court\nof Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in\nthe context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egre\ngious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court’s\nrejection of respondent’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence\nclaim “involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly\n12                      MCDANIEL v.

C. §2254(d)(1).4\n   Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it,\nthe Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely ex\ncluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testimony from\nthat court’s consideration. The Report did not contest that\nthe DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence\nremains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the\nState concedes Romero overstated its probative value by\nfailing to dispel the prosecutor’s fallacy. And Mueller’s\nclaim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underes\ntimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers\nindicates that two experts do not agree with one another,\nnot that Romero’s estimates were unreliable.5\n   Mueller’s opinion that “the chance that among four\nbrothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,” App. 1583,\nis substantially different from Romero’s estimate of a 1 in\n6,500 chance that one brother would match. But even if\nRomero’s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury\nverdict is not undermined. First, the estimate that is\nmore pertinent to this case is 1 in 132—the probability of a\n——————\n  4 The  Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada\nSupreme Court’s decision was “contrary to” Jackson. The Court of\nAppeals held the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was “contrary to”\nJackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a\n“reasonable” jury, not a “rational” one, and that assesses whether the\njury could have been convinced of a defendant’s guilt, rather than\nwhether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 794–795 (CA9 2008). It is of little\nmoment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a “reason\nable” jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather\nthan asking whether a “rational” one could be convinced of each ele\nment of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt\nunless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  5 The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have\n\ncriticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 53–54. We need not pass on the relative credibility of\nthe two experts because even assuming that Mueller’s estimate is\ncorrect, respondent’s claim fails.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Second, although Jane Doe men\ntioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby\ntrailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were\nsober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.\nEven under Mueller’s odds, a rational jury could consider\nthe DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.\n   Furthermore, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of the\nnon-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review\nthat Jackson and §2254(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas\ncourt can only set aside a state-court decision as “an un\nreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal\nlaw,” §2254(d)(1), if the state court’s application of that\nlaw is “objectively unreasonable,” Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 409 (2000). And Jackson requires a reviewing\ncourt to review the evidence “in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution.” 443 U. S., at 319. Expressed more fully,\nthis means a reviewing court “faced with a record of his\ntorical facts that supports conflicting inferences must\npresume—even if it does not affirmatively appear in the\nrecord—that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolu\ntion.” Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,\n330 (1995) (“The Jackson standard . . . looks to whether\nthere is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could sup\nport the conviction”). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat it must review the evidence in the light most favor\nable to the prosecution, but the court’s recitation of incon\nsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.\n   For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony\nregarding when Troy left the Peacock. 525 F. 3d, at 797.\nIt is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one\nbartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy\nwould have left the bar after the attack occurred. Yet the\njury could have credited a different bartender’s testimony\nthat Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m. Resolving\n14                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have\nfound that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant. It\nis undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately\nupon returning home. The court notes this is “plausibly\nconsistent with him being the assailant” but also that he\nprovided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.\nIbid. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecu\ntion, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed\nthe clothes immediately to clean blood from them.\n    To be sure, the court’s Jackson analysis relied substan\ntially upon a concession made by the State in state post\nconviction proceedings that “absent the DNA findings,\nthere was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the\ncrime.” App. 1180. But that concession posited a situation\nin which there was no DNA evidence at all,6 not a situa\ntion in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA\nevidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of\nAppeals’ analysis failed to preserve “the factfinder’s role as\nweigher of the evidence” by reviewing “all of the evidence\n. . . in the light most favorable to the prosecution,” Jack\nson, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the\nNevada Supreme Court’s resolution of the Jackson claim\nwas objectively unreasonable.\n                            IV\n  Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consid\neration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm\non an alternative ground. He contends the two errors “in\ndescribing the statistical meaning” of the DNA evidence\nrendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him\n——————\n  6 The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which\n\nrespondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the\nadmissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of grounds—including\nRomero’s qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow\nthe proper testing protocol—and might have successfully excluded the\nDNA evidence altogether.

Because the\nNinth Circuit held that “the admission of Romero’s unreli\nable and misleading testimony violated [respondent’s] due\nprocess rights,” 525 F. 3d, at 797, and in respondent’s view\nmerely applied Jackson (erroneously) to determine\nwhether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the\njudgment below on the basis of what he calls his “DNA due\nprocess” claim, Brief for Respondent 35.\n  As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this\nclaim, he would have to show that the state court’s adjudi\ncation of the claim was “contrary to, or involved an unrea\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The clearly established law he\npoints us to is Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114\n(1977), in which we held that when the police have used a\nsuggestive eyewitness identification procedure, “reliability\nis the linchpin in determining” whether an eyewitness\nidentification may be admissible, with reliability deter\nmined according to factors set out in Neil v. Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188 (1972). Respondent argues that the admission of\nthe inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite be\ncause the testimony was “identification testimony,” 432\nU. S., at 114, was “unnecessarily suggestive,” id., at 113,\nand was unreliable.\n  Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for\nthe very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.\nRespondent did not present his new “DNA due process”\nclaim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consis\ntently argued that Romero’s testimony should be excluded\nfrom the Jackson analysis simply because it was “unreli\nable” and that the due process violation occurred because\nthe remaining evidence was insufficient to convict. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (“[Respondent] asserts . . . that\nthe DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have\nbeen admitted at his trial.

But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim\nrespondent did make in his federal habeas petition under Jackson. It is\nclear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider—and did not pass\nupon—the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a\ndecision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), or any other\nclearly established law regarding due process other than Jackson.\n  8 The State contends the claim is either not exhausted or procedurally\n\ndefaulted. The State has objected from the beginning that respondent\ndid not raise a due process claim regarding the reliability of the DNA\nevidence in state court. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–183a. Respon\ndent consistently answered the State’s exhaustion objection by arguing\nhe presented his Jackson claim in the Nevada Supreme Court. See\nApp. 1521–1526. The Ninth Circuit held respondent exhausted his\ninsufficiency claim. 525 F. 3d, at 793.

Nelson, 488 U. S.\n33, 41 (1988)); see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307\n(1979). I write separately because I disagree with the\nCourt’s decision to complicate its analysis with an exten\nsive discussion of the Mueller Report. See ante, at 7–13.\nDefense counsel commissioned that report 11 years after\nrespondent’s trial. See ante, at 1. Accordingly, the re\nport’s attacks on the State’s DNA testimony were not part\nof the trial evidence and have no place in the Jackson\ninquiry. See Jackson, supra, at 318; Lockhart, supra, at\n40–42. That is all we need or should say about the report\nin deciding this case.\n  The Court’s opinion demonstrates as much. The Court’s\nlengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, see ante, at 7–\n10, is merely a predicate to asserting that “even if” the\nCourt of Appeals could have considered the report in its\nJackson analysis, the report “provided no warrant for\nentirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testi\n2                       MCDANIEL v.

Based on these observations, the\nCourt concludes that the Mueller Report did not under\nmine the State’s DNA tests as “powerful inculpatory evi\ndence.” Ibid. That is true, but even if the report had\ncompletely undermined the DNA evidence—which the\nNinth Circuit may have mistakenly believed it did, see\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 795–796 (2008)—the\npanel still would have erred in considering the report to\nresolve respondent’s Jackson claim. The reason, as the\nCourt reaffirms, is that Jackson claims must be decided\nsolely on the evidence adduced at trial. See ante, at 11.\nAccordingly, the Court need not correct any erroneous\nimpressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning\nthe report’s impact on the State’s DNA evidence to resolve\nrespondent’s Jackson claim.* Because that is the only\nclaim properly before us, I do not join the Court’s dicta\nabout how the Mueller Report’s findings could affect a\nconstitutional analysis to which we have long held such\npost-trial evidence does not apply. See Jackson, supra, at\n318.\n\n——————\n   * Correcting the Ninth Circuit’s apparent misconception of the effects\nof the Mueller Report is the only plausible reason for the Court’s\ndecision to explain that the report would not have undermined the\nState’s DNA results “even if” the Court of Appeals could have consid\nered it in resolving respondent’s Jackson claim. Ante, at 11–12. That\ndiscussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are\ncircumstances in which post-trial evidence would “warrant” excluding\nDNA trial evidence from a Jackson analysis, ante, at 12, or that courts\napplying Jackson may consider post-trial evidence for any other pur\npose. Both points are squarely foreclosed by the precedents on which\nthe Court relies in reversing the Ninth Circuit’s judgment. See ante, at\n1 (citing Jackson, v. Virginia, 443 U.

A Nevada\njury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented\nincluded DNA evidence matching respondent’s DNA pro\nfile. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a\nDNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal\nDistrict Court applied the Jackson standard and granted\nthe writ.

Their brother Trent and his wife\nRaquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the\nstreet from Jane Doe’s. Both Troy and Trent were ac\nquainted with Jane Doe’s family; Troy had visited Jane\nDoe’s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis.\nThe evening of the attack, Jane’s mother, Pam, took Jane\nto Raquel and Trent’s trailer to babysit while the three\nadults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent\nreturned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about\n9:30 p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and\nplaying pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock\nLounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister\nwere home alone because he answered the phone at\nthe bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that\nevening.\n  Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by\nbeer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself\nwhile he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at\nabout 12:15 a.m. Jane called her mother to report the\nrape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have\ntaken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,\nTroy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He\nwas wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin\njacket, and boots.

Several days after the\nrape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as\nher assailant but then stated that the man who had sent\nflowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had\nsent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify\nTroy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could\nnot identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape,\nhowever, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a\nblack jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also\nvividly remembered that the man “stunk real, real bad” of\n“cologne, or some beer or puke or something.” Id., at 172–\n173.\n   Some evidence besides Jane’s inconsistent identification\ndid not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she\nhad bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite\nmarks on his hands when examined by a police officer\napproximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated\nthat her assailant’s jacket had a zipper (Troy’s did not)\nand that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi\ntionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy\nleft the Peacock and when Pam received Jane’s call report\ning the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling\nbetween the two trailers reported a bright green logo on\nthe back of the jacket, but Troy’s jacket had a yellow and\norange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a\nnight light on when she went to bed, the police suspected\nthe assailant had turned off the light. The only usable\nfingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy’s and\nthe police did not find Troy’s fingerprints in the trailer.\n   Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The\npolice recovered semen from Jane’s underwear and from\n4                       MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe rape kit. The State’s expert, Renee Romero, tested the\nformer and determined that the DNA matched Troy’s and\nthat the probability another person from the general\npopulation would share the same DNA (the “random\nmatch probability”) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy’s coun\nsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he\nconsulted with an expert in advance who found no prob\nlems with Romero’s test procedures. At some time before\nsentencing, Troy’s family had additional DNA testing\ndone. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit\nmatched Troy’s DNA, with a random match probability of\n1 in 10,000.\n   The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen\ntenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10\nyears.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court\nconsidered Troy’s claim that his conviction was not sup\nported by sufficient evidence, analyzing “whether the jury,\nacting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy’s]\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown v. Nevada, 113\nNev. 275, 285, 934 P. 2d 235, 241 (1997) (per curiam).

Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial\nbodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without\nthe possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10\nyears. §200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The\njudge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years\non a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada\nSupreme Court reversed Troy’s conviction for one count of child abuse\non double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second\nsexual assault count. Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 934 P. 2d 235\n(1997) (per curiam). On resentencing, the judge imposed the same\nsentence as before.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Furthermore, testimony indicated that\n    Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave\n    him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,\n    [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resem\n    bling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling\n    in the road near Jane Doe’s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy\n    also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,\n    arguably to remove the blood evidence from his\n    clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that se\n    men collected from Jane Doe’s underwear matched\n    Troy’s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had\n    matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1\n    in 10,000 people had matching DNA).” Ibid., 934\n    P. 2d, at 241–242.\nRespondent also argued on appeal that the trial court\nerred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine\nwhether the DNA evidence was reliable.

He noted\nthat because trial counsel “totally failed to challenge the\nDNA evidence in the case,” counsel “failed to preserve\nvalid issues for appeal.” App. 1101. The state postconvic\ntion court denied relief, id., at 1489–1499, and the Nevada\nSupreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500–1506.\n   Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,\nclaiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on\nthe sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an\nunreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a\ntypical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that\nthe totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial\nwas constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of\nthe evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy\nsis. In particular, he argued that Romero’s testimony\nrelated to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli\nable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized\nthe random match probability and misstated the probabil\nity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that\ntestimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence\nto convict him.\n   In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro\nmero’s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared\nby Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution\nary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple\nmented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it\nwas not presented to any state court, because “the thesis\nof the report was argued during post-conviction.” Brown\nv. Farwell, No. 3:03–cv–00712–PMP–VPC, 2006 WL\n6181129, *5, n. 2 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).\n   Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set\naside the “unreliable DNA testimony” and held that with\nout the DNA evidence “a reasonable doubt would exist in\nthe mind of any rational trier of fact.” Id., at *7.

C. §2254(d)(1).\nThe Court of Appeals first reasoned “the admission of\nRomero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated\nTroy’s due process rights,” so the District Court was cor\nrect to exclude it. 525 F. 3d, at 797. It then “weighed the\nsufficiency of the remaining evidence,” including the Dis\ntrict Court’s “catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies\nthat would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy’s guilt in\nthe mind of any rational juror.” Ibid. In light of the\n“stark” conflicts in the evidence and the State’s concession\nthat there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA\nevidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable\nfor the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent’s\ninsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. Id., at 798.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U.

Brown v.\nFarwell, No. 3:03–cv–00712–PMP–VPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *9–*10\n(Nev., Dec. 14, 2006). The Court of Appeals did not consider those\nclaims on appeal and they are not now before us.\n8                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nRomero’s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any\nof the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends\nthat Romero committed the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy”\nand that she underestimated the probability of a DNA\nmatch between respondent and one of his brothers.\n  The prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the\nrandom match probability is the same as the probability\nthat the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.\nSee Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic\nScience, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133\n(1996) (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the\nevidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the\nprobability that the DNA at the crime scene came from\nsomeone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a\njuror is told the probability a member of the general popu\nlation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random\nmatch probability), and he takes that to mean there is\nonly a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the\ndefendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime\nscene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the\nprosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source\nprobability with probability of guilt, unless there is no\nexplanation other than guilt for a person to be the source\nof crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in\nan erroneous statement that, based on a random match\nprobability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de\nfendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is\nguilty.\n  The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero’s opinion\nthat only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA\nprofile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how\never, that some of Romero’s testimony—as well as the\nprosecutor’s argument—suggested that the evidence also\nestablished that there was only a .000033% chance that\nrespondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.\nBrief for Petitioners 54. For example, the prosecutor\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nargued at closing the jury could be “99.999967 percent\nsure” in this case. App. 730. And when the prosecutor\nasked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat\ning source probability with random match probability,\nwhether “it [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that\nthe DNA found in the panties—the semen in the panties—\nand the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy\nBrown would be .000033,” id., at 460, Romero ultimately\nagreed that it was “not inaccurate” to state it that way,\nid., at 461–462.\n   Looking at Romero’s testimony as a whole, though, she\nalso indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe\nmatical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per\ncentage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent\nages, she answered affirmatively the court’s question\nwhether the percentage was “the same math just ex\npressed differently.” Id., at 462. She pointed out that the\nprobability a brother would match was greater than the\nrandom match probability, which also indicated to the jury\nthat the random match probability is not the same as the\nlikelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of\nthe DNA.\n   The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero’s\ntestimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more\nof Troy’s brothers’ DNA would match. Romero testified\nthere was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one\nbrother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at\n469, 472. When asked whether “that change[s] at all with\ntwo brothers,” she answered no. Id., at 472. According to\nMueller, Romero’s analysis was misleading in two re\nspects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par\nents under which siblings have the lowest chance of\nmatching that is biologically possible, but even under this\nstingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers\nmatching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024\nunder her assumption). Second, using the assumptions\n10                  MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nMueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single\nsibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability\nthat among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in\n132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.\n  In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns\nare testimony equating random match probability with\nsource probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood\nthat one of Troy’s brothers would also match the DNA left\nat the scene.\n                              III\n   Although we granted certiorari to review respondent’s\nJackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of\nAppeals’ resolution of his claim under Jackson was in\nerror. See Brief for Respondent 2–3; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals\ndid not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead\nresolved the question whether admission of Romero’s\ninaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally\nunfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether\nthat error was harmless.\n   Although both petitioners and respondent are now\naligned on the same side of the questions presented for our\nreview, the case is not moot because “the parties continue\nto seek different relief” from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele\nphone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Respondent primarily argues\nthat we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or\nremand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process\nclaim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993). The State, on the\nother hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and one\namicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as\nimprovidently granted, Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27–28, but\nwe think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Pacific Bell, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the Dis\ntrict Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of\nevaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35,\nand concedes the “purpose of a Jackson analysis is to\ndetermine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in\nreturning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,\nnot whether improper evidence violated due process,” id.,\nat 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of\nit was excluded. Respondent’s concession thus disposes of\nhis Jackson claim. The concession is also clearly correct.\nAn “appellate court’s reversal for insufficiency of the evi\ndence is in effect a determination that the government’s\ncase against the defendant was so lacking that the trial\ncourt should have entered a judgment of acquittal.” Lock\nhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988). Because reversal\nfor insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judg\nment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. See\nBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978). To “make\nthe analogy complete” between a reversal for insufficiency\nof the evidence and the trial court’s granting a judgment of\nacquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, “a reviewing court\nmust consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial\ncourt,” regardless whether that evidence was admitted\nerroneously, id., at 41.\n   Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a review\ning court must consider all of the evidence admitted at\ntrial when considering a Jackson claim. Even if we set\nthat concession aside, however, and assume that the Court\nof Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in\nthe context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egre\ngious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court’s\nrejection of respondent’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence\nclaim “involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly\n12                      MCDANIEL v.

C. §2254(d)(1).4\n   Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it,\nthe Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely ex\ncluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testimony from\nthat court’s consideration. The Report did not contest that\nthe DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence\nremains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the\nState concedes Romero overstated its probative value by\nfailing to dispel the prosecutor’s fallacy. And Mueller’s\nclaim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underes\ntimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers\nindicates that two experts do not agree with one another,\nnot that Romero’s estimates were unreliable.5\n   Mueller’s opinion that “the chance that among four\nbrothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,” App. 1583,\nis substantially different from Romero’s estimate of a 1 in\n6,500 chance that one brother would match. But even if\nRomero’s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury\nverdict is not undermined. First, the estimate that is\nmore pertinent to this case is 1 in 132—the probability of a\n——————\n  4 The  Court of Appeals also clearly erred in concluding the Nevada\nSupreme Court’s decision was “contrary to” Jackson. The Court of\nAppeals held the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was “contrary to”\nJackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a\n“reasonable” jury, not a “rational” one, and that assesses whether the\njury could have been convinced of a defendant’s guilt, rather than\nwhether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 794–795 (CA9 2008). It is of little\nmoment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a “reason\nable” jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather\nthan asking whether a “rational” one could be convinced of each ele\nment of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt\nunless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  5 The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have\n\ncriticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 53–54. We need not pass on the relative credibility of\nthe two experts because even assuming that Mueller’s estimate is\ncorrect, respondent’s claim fails.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Second, although Jane Doe men\ntioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby\ntrailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were\nsober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.\nEven under Mueller’s odds, a rational jury could consider\nthe DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.\n   Furthermore, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of the\nnon-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review\nthat Jackson and §2254(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas\ncourt can only set aside a state-court decision as “an un\nreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal\nlaw,” §2254(d)(1), if the state court’s application of that\nlaw is “objectively unreasonable,” Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 409 (2000). And Jackson requires a reviewing\ncourt to review the evidence “in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution.” 443 U. S., at 319. Expressed more fully,\nthis means a reviewing court “faced with a record of his\ntorical facts that supports conflicting inferences must\npresume—even if it does not affirmatively appear in the\nrecord—that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolu\ntion.” Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,\n330 (1995) (“The Jackson standard . . . looks to whether\nthere is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could sup\nport the conviction”). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat it must review the evidence in the light most favor\nable to the prosecution, but the court’s recitation of incon\nsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.\n   For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony\nregarding when Troy left the Peacock. 525 F. 3d, at 797.\nIt is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one\nbartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy\nwould have left the bar after the attack occurred. Yet the\njury could have credited a different bartender’s testimony\nthat Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m. Resolving\n14                      MCDANIEL v. BROWN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nthe conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have\nfound that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant. It\nis undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately\nupon returning home. The court notes this is “plausibly\nconsistent with him being the assailant” but also that he\nprovided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.\nIbid. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecu\ntion, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed\nthe clothes immediately to clean blood from them.\n    To be sure, the court’s Jackson analysis relied substan\ntially upon a concession made by the State in state post\nconviction proceedings that “absent the DNA findings,\nthere was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the\ncrime.” App. 1180. But that concession posited a situation\nin which there was no DNA evidence at all,6 not a situa\ntion in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA\nevidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of\nAppeals’ analysis failed to preserve “the factfinder’s role as\nweigher of the evidence” by reviewing “all of the evidence\n. . . in the light most favorable to the prosecution,” Jack\nson, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the\nNevada Supreme Court’s resolution of the Jackson claim\nwas objectively unreasonable.\n                            IV\n  Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consid\neration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm\non an alternative ground. He contends the two errors “in\ndescribing the statistical meaning” of the DNA evidence\nrendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him\n——————\n  6 The concession was made in the context of proceedings in which\n\nrespondent argued that competent counsel would have objected to the\nadmissibility of the DNA evidence on a number of grounds—including\nRomero’s qualifications, chain-of-custody problems, and failure to follow\nthe proper testing protocol—and might have successfully excluded the\nDNA evidence altogether.

Because the\nNinth Circuit held that “the admission of Romero’s unreli\nable and misleading testimony violated [respondent’s] due\nprocess rights,” 525 F. 3d, at 797, and in respondent’s view\nmerely applied Jackson (erroneously) to determine\nwhether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the\njudgment below on the basis of what he calls his “DNA due\nprocess” claim, Brief for Respondent 35.\n  As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this\nclaim, he would have to show that the state court’s adjudi\ncation of the claim was “contrary to, or involved an unrea\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The clearly established law he\npoints us to is Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114\n(1977), in which we held that when the police have used a\nsuggestive eyewitness identification procedure, “reliability\nis the linchpin in determining” whether an eyewitness\nidentification may be admissible, with reliability deter\nmined according to factors set out in Neil v. Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188 (1972). Respondent argues that the admission of\nthe inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite be\ncause the testimony was “identification testimony,” 432\nU. S., at 114, was “unnecessarily suggestive,” id., at 113,\nand was unreliable.\n  Respondent has forfeited this claim, which he makes for\nthe very first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.\nRespondent did not present his new “DNA due process”\nclaim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consis\ntently argued that Romero’s testimony should be excluded\nfrom the Jackson analysis simply because it was “unreli\nable” and that the due process violation occurred because\nthe remaining evidence was insufficient to convict. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (“[Respondent] asserts . . . that\nthe DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have\nbeen admitted at his trial.

But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim\nrespondent did make in his federal habeas petition under Jackson. It is\nclear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider—and did not pass\nupon—the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a\ndecision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Manson v.

Respon\ndent consistently answered the State’s exhaustion objection by arguing\nhe presented his Jackson claim in the Nevada Supreme Court. See\nApp. 1521–1526.

I write separately because I disagree with the\nCourt’s decision to complicate its analysis with an exten\nsive discussion of the Mueller Report. See ante, at 7–13.\nDefense counsel commissioned that report 11 years after\nrespondent’s trial. See ante, at 1. Accordingly, the re\nport’s attacks on the State’s DNA testimony were not part\nof the trial evidence and have no place in the Jackson\ninquiry.

The Court’s\nlengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, see ante, at 7–\n10, is merely a predicate to asserting that “even if” the\nCourt of Appeals could have considered the report in its\nJackson analysis, the report “provided no warrant for\nentirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testi\n2                       MCDANIEL v.

Based on these observations, the\nCourt concludes that the Mueller Report did not under\nmine the State’s DNA tests as “powerful inculpatory evi\ndence.” Ibid. That is true, but even if the report had\ncompletely undermined the DNA evidence—which the\nNinth Circuit may have mistakenly believed it did, see\nBrown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 795–796 (2008)—the\npanel still would have erred in considering the report to\nresolve respondent’s Jackson claim. The reason, as the\nCourt reaffirms, is that Jackson claims must be decided\nsolely on the evidence adduced at trial. See ante, at 11.\nAccordingly, the Court need not correct any erroneous\nimpressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning\nthe report’s impact on the State’s DNA evidence to resolve\nrespondent’s Jackson claim.* Because that is the only\nclaim properly before us, I do not join the Court’s dicta\nabout how the Mueller Report’s findings could affect a\nconstitutional analysis to which we have long held such\npost-trial evidence does not apply. See Jackson, supra, at\n318.\n\n——————\n   * Correcting the Ninth Circuit’s apparent misconception of the effects\nof the Mueller Report is the only plausible reason for the Court’s\ndecision to explain that the report would not have undermined the\nState’s DNA results “even if” the Court of Appeals could have consid\nered it in resolving respondent’s Jackson claim. Ante, at 11–12. That\ndiscussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are\ncircumstances in which post-trial evidence would “warrant” excluding\nDNA trial evidence from a Jackson analysis, ante, at 12, or that courts\napplying Jackson may consider post-trial evidence for any other pur\npose. Both points are squarely foreclosed by the precedents on which\nthe Court relies in reversing the Ninth Circuit’s judgment. See ante, at\n1 (citing Jackson, v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979)); ante, at 11\n(citing Lockhart, v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988)), respectively.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1750/", "sha1": "c232d94cf10b4a766d7a4a59782c9f59ae90fd8f", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-021", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:16"}
