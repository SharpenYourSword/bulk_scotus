Scott v.\nAmerican Tobacco Co., 2004\u20132095, p. 14. (La. App. 2/7/07)\n949 So. 2d 1266, 1277. The Fourth Circuit Court of Ap\npeal of Louisiana granted relief on that theory, and en\ntered a judgment requiring applicants to pay $241,540,488\n(plus accumulated interest of about $29 million) to fund a\n10-year smoking cessation program for the benefit of the\nmembers of the plaintiff class. Scott v. American Tobacco\nCo., 2009\u20130461, p. 21\u201323 (5/5/10) 36 So. 3d 1046, 1059\u2013\n1060. (Still to be determined are the allowable attorney\u2019s\nfees, which will likely be requested in the tens of millions\nof dollars.) The Supreme Court of Louisiana declined\nreview.     Scott v. American Tobacco Co., 2010\u20131361\n(9/3/10), ___ So. 3d ___. The applicants have asked me, in\nmy capacity as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit, to stay\nthe judgment until this Court can act on their intended\npetition for a writ of certiorari.\n2            PHILIP MORRIS USA INC. v. SCOTT\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\n   A single Justice has authority to enter such a stay, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72101(f), but the applicant bears a heavy burden.\nIt is our settled practice to grant a stay only when three\nconditions are met: First, there must be a reasonable\nprobability that certiorari will be granted (or probable\njurisdiction noted). Second, there must be a significant\npossibility that the judgment below will be reversed. And\nthird, assuming the applicant\u2019s position on the merits is\ncorrect, there must be a likelihood of irreparable harm if\nthe judgment is not stayed. Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc.\nGroup Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U. S.\n1301, 1302 (1991) (SCALIA, J., in chambers). I conclude\nthat this standard is met.\n   Applicants complain of many violations of due process,\nincluding (among others) denial of the opportunity to\ncross-examine the named representatives of the class,\nfactually unsupported estimations of the number of class\nmembers entitled to relief, and constant revision of the\nlegal basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim during the course of\nlitigation. Even though the judgment that is the alleged\nconsequence of these claimed errors is massive\u2014more\nthan $250 million\u2014I would not be inclined to believe that\nthis Court would grant certiorari to consider these fact\nbound contentions that may have no effect on other cases.\n   But one asserted error in particular (and perhaps some\nof the others as well) implicates constitutional constraints\non the allowable alteration of normal process in class\nactions. This is a fraud case, and in Louisiana the tort of\nfraud normally requires proof that the plaintiff detrimen\ntally relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. 949\nSo. 2d, at 1277. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal indi\ncated that members of the plaintiff class who wish to seek\nindividual damages, rather than just access to smoking\ncessation measures, would have to establish their own\nreliance on the alleged distortions. Ibid. But the Court of\nAppeal held that this element need not be proved insofar\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nas the class seeks payment into a fund that will benefit\nindividual plaintiffs, since the defendants are guilty of a\n\u201cdistort[ion of] the entire body of public knowledge\u201d on\nwhich the \u201cclass as a whole\u201d has relied. Id., at 1277\u20131278.\nThus, the court eliminated any need for plaintiffs to prove,\nand denied any opportunity for applicants to contest, that\nany particular plaintiff who benefits from the judgment\n(much less all of them) believed applicants\u2019 distortions and\ncontinued to smoke as a result.\n   Applicants allege that this violates their due-process\nright to \u201can opportunity to present every available de\nfense.\u201d Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56, 66 (1972) (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted) (quoting American Surety\nCo. v. Baldwin, 287 U. S. 156, 168 (1932)). Respondents\nconcede that due process requires such an opportunity, but\nthey contend that the intermediate state court\u2019s pro\nnouncement means that, as a matter of Louisiana\u2019s sub\nstantive law, applicants have no nonreliance defense.\nThat response may ultimately prove persuasive, but at\nthis stage it serves to describe the issue rather than re\nsolve it. The apparent consequence of the Court of Ap\npeal\u2019s holding is that individual plaintiffs who could not\nrecover had they sued separately can recover only because\ntheir claims were aggregated with others\u2019 through the\nprocedural device of the class action.\n   The extent to which class treatment may constitution\nally reduce the normal requirements of due process is an\nimportant question. National concern over abuse of the\nclass-action device induced Congress to permit removal of\nmost major class actions to federal court, see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71332(d), where they will be subject to the significant\nlimitations of the Federal Rules. Federal removal jurisdic\ntion has not been accorded, however, over many class\nactions in which more than two-thirds of the plaintiff class\nare citizens of the forum State. See \u00a71332(d)(4). Because\nthe class here was drawn to include only residents of\n4             PHILIP MORRIS USA INC. v. SCOTT\n\n                      Opinion in Chambers\n\nLouisiana, this suit typifies the sort of major class action\nthat often will not be removable, and in which the con\nstraints of the Due Process Clause will be the only federal\nprotection. There is no conflict between federal courts of\nappeals or between state supreme courts on the principal\nissue I have described; but the former seems impossible,\nsince by definition only state class actions are at issue;\nand the latter seems implausible, unless one posits the\nunlikely case where the novel approach to class-action\nliability is a legislative rather than judicial creation, or the\ncreation of a lower state court disapproved by the state\nsupreme court on federal constitutional grounds. This\nconstitutional issue ought not to be permanently beyond\nour review.\n   Given those considerations, I conclude applicants have\nsatisfied the prerequisites for a stay. I think it reasonably\nprobable that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari,\nand significantly possible that the judgment below will be\nreversed. As for irreparable harm: Normally the mere\npayment of money is not considered irreparable, see\nSampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 90 (1974), but that is\nbecause money can usually be recovered from the person\nto whom it is paid. If expenditures cannot be recouped,\nthe resulting loss may be irreparable. See, e.g., Mori v.\nBoilermakers, 454 U. S. 1301, 1303 (1981) (Rehnquist,\nJ., in chambers). Here it appears that, before this Court\nwill be able to consider and resolve applicants\u2019 claims, a\nsubstantial portion of the fund established by their pay\nment will be irrevocably expended. Funds spent to pro\nvide anti-smoking counseling and devices will not likely be\nrecoverable; nor, it seems, will the $11,501,928 fee imme\ndiately payable toward administrative expenses in setting\nup the funded program.\n   That does not end the matter. A stay will not issue\nsimply because the necessary conditions are satisfied.\nRather, \u201csound equitable discretion will deny the stay\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  5\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nwhen \u2018a decided balance of convenience\u2019 \u201d weighs against\nit.

Refusing a stay may visit an irreversible\nharm on applicants, but granting it will apparently do no\npermanent injury to respondents. Applicants allege that\nsimilar smoking-cessation measures are freely and readily\navailable from other sources in Louisiana, and respon\ndents have not disputed that. Under those circumstances,\nthe equitable balance favors issuance of the stay.\n   The application for a stay of the execution of the judg\nment of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit,\nis granted pending applicants\u2019 timely filing, and this\nCourt\u2019s disposition, of a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",
