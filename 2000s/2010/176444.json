Lux seeks an injunction requiring the Virginia\nState Board of Elections to count signatures that he col\nlected in an effort to place himself on the congressional\nballot. The application is denied.\n   Lux is an independent candidate for the U. S. House of\nRepresentatives in Virginia\u2019s Seventh Congressional\nDistrict. Under Virginia law, an independent candidate\nfor Congress must obtain 1,000 signatures from voters\nregistered in the relevant congressional district in order to\nappear on the ballot. Va. Code Ann. \u00a724.2\u2013506 (Lexis\n2010 Cum. Supp.). That same provision requires, among\nother things, that each signature be witnessed by a resi\ndent of that district. Ibid.\n  Although Lux is a candidate for the Seventh District, he\nis a resident of Virginia\u2019s First District. As a result, he\ncannot serve as a witness for signatures from Seventh\nDistrict residents. Despite that fact, Lux witnessed 1,063\nof the 1,224 signatures collected on his behalf.

A\nCircuit Justice\u2019s issuance of an injunction \u201cdoes not simply\nsuspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants\njudicial intervention that has been withheld by lower\ncourts,\u201d and therefore \u201cdemands a significantly higher\njustification\u201d than that required for a stay.
