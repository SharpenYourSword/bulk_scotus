MICHAEL CASPER ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 10\u201367. Decided October 12, 2010\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\njoins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   The President of the United States gave a speech open\nto the public, from which Leslie Weise and Alex Young\nallege they were forcibly ejected. Their transgression was\nto have arrived at the event in a car that displayed a\nbumper sticker reading \u201cNo More Blood For Oil.\u201d After\nthey were marched out, they allege, Secret Service officials\nconfirmed to them that the bumper sticker was the reason\nfor their exclusion.\n   I cannot see how reasonable public officials, or any staff\nor volunteers under their direction, could have viewed the\nbumper sticker as a permissible reason for depriving\nWeise and Young of access to the event. Nevertheless, the\nCourt of Appeals held respondents entitled to qualified\nimmunity because \u201cno specific authority instructs this\ncourt . . . how to treat the ejection of a silent attendee from\nan official speech based on the attendee\u2019s protected ex\npression outside the speech area.\u201d 593 F. 3d 1163, 1170\n(CA10 2010). No \u201cspecific authority\u201d should have been\nneeded; \u201c[f]or at least a [half]-century, this Court has\nmade clear that . . . [the government] may not deny a\nbenefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitu\ntionally protected interests.\u201d Perry v. Sindermann, 408\nU. S. 593, 597 (1972). As Judge Holloway noted in his\nincisive dissent, solidly established law \u201cmay apply with\nobvious clarity\u201d even to conduct startling in its novelty.\n2                    WEISE v. CASPER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n593 F. 3d, at 1177 (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730,\n741 (2002); emphasis deleted).\n  The Court of Appeals suggested that this Court\u2019s deci\nsion in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisex\nual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995), could have\njustified a decision to exclude individuals who appear to\ndisagree with the President\u2019s views. But the comparison\nserves only to highlight the unlawfulness of Weise\u2019s and\nYoung\u2019s alleged treatment: Not only was this an official\npresentation of the President\u2019s views, not a private act of\nexpression as in Hurley; in addition, unlike the Hurley\nplaintiff who sought to engage in competing expression,\nWeise and Young were \u201csilent attendee[s],\u201d 593 F. 3d, at\n1170 (emphasis added). Their presence alone cannot have\naffected the President\u2019s message. Therefore, ejecting them\nfor holding discordant views could only have been a repri\nsal for the expression conveyed by the bumper sticker.\n\u201cOfficial reprisal for protected speech \u2018offends the Consti\ntution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the pro\ntected right.\u2019 \u201d Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 256\n(2006) (quoting Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 588,\nn. 10 (1998); brackets omitted).\n  I see only one arguable reason for deferring the question\nthis case presents. Respondents were volunteers following\ninstructions from White House officials. The Volunteer\nProtection Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 218, 42 U. S. C. \u00a714501 et\nseq., had respondents invoked it in the courts below, might\nhave shielded them from liability. Federal officials them\nselves, however, gain no shelter from that Act. Suits\nagainst the officials responsible for Weise\u2019s and Young\u2019s\nouster remain pending and may offer this Court an oppor\ntunity to take up the issue avoided today.\n",
