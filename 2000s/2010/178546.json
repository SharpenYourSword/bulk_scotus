ANTHONY BERNARD\n                 SMITH, JR.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09\u20131031. Decided November 1, 2010\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE SCALIA join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   The Court of Appeals granted habeas relief in this case\nafter concluding that a state trial judge unconstitutionally\ncoerced the jury by commenting and offering an opinion on\nthe evidence. Because that decision cannot be reconciled\nwith the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and gives short\nshrift to a venerable common-law practice, I would grant\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n                             I\n  After they learned that Eugene and Deanna S. had won\nsome money at a casino, respondent Anthony Smith and\ncodefendant James Hinex drove to the couple\u2019s Sacra\nmento home, burglarized it, and robbed both victims at\ngunpoint. During the robbery, one of the defendants put a\ngun to the head of Mrs. S. and forced her to perform oral\ncopulation. Both Smith and Hinex were arrested and\ncharged under California law with one count of residential\nburglary and two counts of residential robbery. Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7459 (West 2010), 211 (West 2008). Smith\nwas also charged with forcible oral copulation. \u00a7288a(c)\n(West 2008). At trial, the jury deliberated for a little over\ntwo days before convicting both defendants on the bur\nglary and robbery counts. The jury had a more difficult\n2                       WONG v. SMITH\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntime reaching agreement on the oral-copulation count.\nTests showed that semen recovered from the crime scene\nmatched Smith\u2019s DNA, but Mrs. S. had originally identi\nfied Hinex as her attacker.\n    On the fourth day of deliberations, one juror sent the\njudge a note stating that he was unable to vote to convict\nSmith on the oral-copulation count because he thought the\nDNA evidence was unreliable. The trial judge then gave\nthe jury a modified version of an Allen charge. See Allen\nv. United States, 164 U. S. 492 (1896). When further\ndeliberations proved fruitless, the judge decided to exer\ncise the judicial authority, as recognized by the State\nConstitution, to \u201ccomment on the evidence.\u201d See Cal.\nConst., Art. VI, \u00a710.\n    At the outset, the judge reminded the jurors that they\nwere the \u201c \u2018exclusive judges of the facts.\u2019 \u201d Smith v. Curry,\n580 F. 3d 1071, 1077 (CA9 2009). He explained that his\ncomments were not intended \u201c \u2018to impose [his] will\u2019 \u201d on the\njury, but only to review \u201ccertain evidence\u201d that they \u201c \u2018may\nnot have considered.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The judge thought it \u201c \u2018impor\ntant\u2019 \u201d for the jury to consider the statements Smith and\nHinex \u201c \u2018made to law enforcement following their arrests,\u2019 \u201d\nparticularly the \u201c \u2018consistencies and inconsistencies\u2019 \u201d\nbetween those statements. Ibid. The judge pointed out\nthat Smith told police that both he and Hinex entered the\nhouse. Smith stated that he found Mrs. S. in a back bed\nroom, that Smith was armed at the time, and that Mrs. S.\ngave Smith a $100 bill. Id., at 1077\u20131078. The judge\nnoted that Hinex also \u201c \u2018said Smith went to the back of the\nhouse . . . and closed the door.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1077. But Hinex\ndenied going inside the house himself. The judge played\nthe tapes of both defendants\u2019 statements for the jury. He\ntold them to consider and discuss the statements during\ndeliberations. Finally, the judge reiterated that his \u201c \u2018com\nments [were] advisory only\u2019 \u201d and that the jurors remained\n\u201c \u2018the exclusive judges\u2019 \u201d of the facts and the \u201c \u2018credibility of\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The jury continued their delib\nerations; a short time later, they returned a guilty verdict\nagainst Smith on the oral-copulation count.\n  Smith argued on appeal that the judge\u2019s comments\ncoerced the jury\u2019s verdict. A California intermediate\nappellate court rejected that claim. The California Su\npreme Court denied review. Smith then filed a federal\npetition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254, which\nthe District Court granted. A split Ninth Circuit panel\naffirmed.\n                               II\n   Smith\u2019s claim on federal habeas is that the California\nappellate court unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s clearly\nestablished law forbidding coercive jury instructions.\n\u00a72254(d)(1); see Brief in Opposition 12. \u201c[C]learly estab\nlished\u201d law under \u00a72254(d)(1) consists of \u201cthe holdings, as\nopposed to the dicta, of this Court\u2019s\u201d cases. Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000). An \u201cunreasonable ap\nplication\u201d of that law involves not just an erroneous or\nincorrect decision, but an objectively unreasonable one.\nRenico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n   The clearly established law relevant to this case is\nsparse. Just one of this Court\u2019s decisions, Lowenfield v.\nPhelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), has addressed the constitu\ntional rule against coercive jury instructions. And Lowen\nfield held only that, on the totality of the circumstances\npresent there, no unconstitutional coercion resulted. Id.,\nat 241. The Court has also decided several cases on the\nspecific practice of judicial comment on the evidence. E.g.,\nQuercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466 (1933). But all of\nthose cases arose under this Court\u2019s supervisory power\nover federal courts; they set no clearly established consti\ntutional limits under AEDPA. See Early v. Packer, 537\nU. S. 3, 10 (2002) (per curiam). As a result, the clearly\nestablished law in this area provides very little specific\n4                           WONG v. SMITH\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nguidance. About all that can be said is that coercive in\nstructions are unconstitutional, coerciveness must be\njudged on the totality of the circumstances, and the facts\nof Lowenfield (polling a deadlocked jury and reading a\nslightly modified Allen charge) were not unconstitutionally\ncoercive. See 484 U. S., at 237\u2013241.\n   A general standard such as this gives state courts wide\nlatitude for reasonable decisionmaking under AEDPA.\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004) (\u201cThe\nmore general the rule, the more leeway courts have in\nreaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\u201d). That\nlatitude is wider still in this case, as no constitutional\ndecision of this Court has ever explained how the general\nrule against \u201ccoercion\u201d applies to the traditional practice of\njudicial comment on the evidence. Cf. Carey v. Musladin,\n549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\n   For centuries, trial judges have enjoyed authority to\ncomment on the evidence. At common law, the judge was\nempowered to \u201cweig[h] the evidence\u201d and share an \u201copin\nion\u201d with the jury, even \u201cin matter of fact.\u201d 2 M. Hale,\nHistory of the Common Law of England 147 (5th ed. 1794)\n(hereinafter Hale).* The practice is well established in\nthis Court\u2019s cases as well. The Court has recognized that\na trial judge has \u201cdiscretion\u201d to \u201ccomment upon the evi\ndence,\u201d to call the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts of it which he\nthinks important,\u201d and to \u201cexpress his opinion upon the\nfacts.\u201d Vicksburg & Meridian R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S.\n545, 553 (1886); Quercia, supra, at 469.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law\n188, n. 2 (1898) (trial by jury \u201cin a form which would withhold from the\njury the assistance of the court in dealing with the facts\u201d is not \u201ctrial by\njury in any historic sense of the word\u201d); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72551,\np. 664 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (hereinafter Wigmore) (comment on the\nevidence \u201cexisted at common law since the beginning of jury trial, and\nmust be regarded historically as an essential and inseparable part of\njury trial\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, the practice has for many years been on the\nwane. Comment on the evidence has always been more\npopular in Britain than it ever was in this country. See 9\nWigmore \u00a72551, at 666. That said, federal courts and\nseveral States continue to recognize judicial authority to\ncomment on the evidence, and California expressly pro\ntects the practice in its State Constitution. Cal. Const.,\nArt. VI, \u00a710.\n  This long tradition, combined with the complete absence\nof constitutional precedent on how to apply Lowenfield\u2019s\nanticoercion principle in this context, shows that federal\ncourts should tread lightly when faced with a claim that\njudicial comment on the evidence runs afoul of clearly\nestablished federal law. Outside of extreme cases, most\ndecisions approving traditional uses of this common-law\npractice should fall within the bounds of reasonable deci\nsionmaking under AEDPA.\n                            III\n  Here, the California appellate court did not unreasona\nbly apply this Court\u2019s clearly established law. The trial\njudge, before commenting on the evidence, made clear that\nthe jurors remained the exclusive judges of the facts and\nthat the judge\u2019s comments were advisory only. 580 F. 3d,\nat 1077. The judge then directed the jurors to particular\nevidence\u2014the defendants\u2019 initial statements to police\u2014\nand highlighted for them certain \u201c \u2018consistencies and in\nconsistencies\u2019 \u201d between those statements. Ibid. This\npractice of drawing the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts\u201d of the\nevidence that the judge thinks \u201c \u2018important\u2019 \u201d lies at the\nrecognized core of the common-law power to comment on\nthe evidence. See Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Hale 147 (The\njudge \u201cis able, . . . in matters of fact, to give [the jury]\ngreat light and assistance, by . . . observing where the\nquestion and knot of the business lies; and by showing\nthem his opinion even in matter of fact\u201d (some capitaliza\n6                     WONG v. SMITH\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntion omitted)). Neither the trial judge\u2019s decision to employ\nthe practice here nor the state appellate court\u2019s approval\nof the instruction ran afoul of clearly established federal\nlaw.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision rested in large\nmeasure on its concern that the comments \u201cpointed the\njury to evidence leading to a particular verdict,\u201d while\nomitting to mention other evidence favorable to Smith.\n580 F. 3d, at 1081, 1083. But the common-law privilege to\ncomment on the evidence has never required a compendi\nous summary. Rather, the judge has traditionally enjoyed\nthe power to focus on the particular evidence the judge\nthinks important, and to share with the jury an opinion on\nthat evidence. Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Quercia, 289\nU. S., at 469. It was not unreasonable under this Court\u2019s\nclearly established law for the California appellate court to\napprove that practice here.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion also suggests that, when a\njury is \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d the judge may provide only \u201cappro\npriate encouragement . . . to deliberate,\u201d and must refrain\nfrom providing the \u201cjudge\u2019s selective view of the evidence.\u201d\n580 F. 3d, at 1080. None of this Court\u2019s constitutional\ncases establish such a rule. And this Court\u2019s supervisory\npower cases (which, if anything, set a more demanding\nstandard than the constitutional minimum) have specifi\ncally upheld judicial comments that provide a particular\n\u201cview of the evidence\u201d to an apparently deadlocked jury.\nSee Simmons v. United States, 142 U. S. 148, 155 (1891)\n(no error where judge denied deadlocked jury\u2019s request to\nbe discharged and told them \u201cthat he regarded the testi\nmony as convincing\u201d). Nothing in this Court\u2019s clearly\nestablished law prohibits the trial judge from offering an\nopinion to a jury that is struggling to reach a verdict.\n   The Ninth Circuit was also troubled that the trial\njudge\u2019s comments appeared to be designed to address the\nconcerns of the holdout juror. 580 F. 3d, at 1082. And the\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

Id., at 1082\u20131083.\nWhatever potential for coercion these comments caused,\nthe California appellate court\u2019s decision upholding them\n\u201cwas clearly not unreasonable\u201d under the general Lowen\nfield standard. See Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). I would grant certiorari in this case and correct the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s error.\n",

At common law, the judge was\nempowered to \u201cweig[h] the evidence\u201d and share an \u201copin\nion\u201d with the jury, even \u201cin matter of fact.\u201d 2 M. Hale,\nHistory of the Common Law of England 147 (5th ed. 1794)\n(hereinafter Hale).* The practice is well established in\nthis Court\u2019s cases as well. The Court has recognized that\na trial judge has \u201cdiscretion\u201d to \u201ccomment upon the evi\ndence,\u201d to call the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts of it which he\nthinks important,\u201d and to \u201cexpress his opinion upon the\nfacts.\u201d Vicksburg & Meridian R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S.\n545, 553 (1886); Quercia, supra, at 469.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law\n188, n. 2 (1898) (trial by jury \u201cin a form which would withhold from the\njury the assistance of the court in dealing with the facts\u201d is not \u201ctrial by\njury in any historic sense of the word\u201d); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72551,\np. 664 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (hereinafter Wigmore) (comment on the\nevidence \u201cexisted at common law since the beginning of jury trial, and\nmust be regarded historically as an essential and inseparable part of\njury trial\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, the practice has for many years been on the\nwane. Comment on the evidence has always been more\npopular in Britain than it ever was in this country. See 9\nWigmore \u00a72551, at 666. That said, federal courts and\nseveral States continue to recognize judicial authority to\ncomment on the evidence, and California expressly pro\ntects the practice in its State Constitution. Cal. Const.,\nArt. VI, \u00a710.\n  This long tradition, combined with the complete absence\nof constitutional precedent on how to apply Lowenfield\u2019s\nanticoercion principle in this context, shows that federal\ncourts should tread lightly when faced with a claim that\njudicial comment on the evidence runs afoul of clearly\nestablished federal law. Outside of extreme cases, most\ndecisions approving traditional uses of this common-law\npractice should fall within the bounds of reasonable deci\nsionmaking under AEDPA.\n                            III\n  Here, the California appellate court did not unreasona\nbly apply this Court\u2019s clearly established law. The trial\njudge, before commenting on the evidence, made clear that\nthe jurors remained the exclusive judges of the facts and\nthat the judge\u2019s comments were advisory only. 580 F. 3d,\nat 1077. The judge then directed the jurors to particular\nevidence\u2014the defendants\u2019 initial statements to police\u2014\nand highlighted for them certain \u201c \u2018consistencies and in\nconsistencies\u2019 \u201d between those statements. Ibid. This\npractice of drawing the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts\u201d of the\nevidence that the judge thinks \u201c \u2018important\u2019 \u201d lies at the\nrecognized core of the common-law power to comment on\nthe evidence. See Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Hale 147 (The\njudge \u201cis able, . . . in matters of fact, to give [the jury]\ngreat light and assistance, by . . . observing where the\nquestion and knot of the business lies; and by showing\nthem his opinion even in matter of fact\u201d (some capitaliza\n6                     WONG v. SMITH\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntion omitted)). Neither the trial judge\u2019s decision to employ\nthe practice here nor the state appellate court\u2019s approval\nof the instruction ran afoul of clearly established federal\nlaw.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision rested in large\nmeasure on its concern that the comments \u201cpointed the\njury to evidence leading to a particular verdict,\u201d while\nomitting to mention other evidence favorable to Smith.\n580 F. 3d, at 1081, 1083. But the common-law privilege to\ncomment on the evidence has never required a compendi\nous summary. Rather, the judge has traditionally enjoyed\nthe power to focus on the particular evidence the judge\nthinks important, and to share with the jury an opinion on\nthat evidence. Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Quercia, 289\nU. S., at 469. It was not unreasonable under this Court\u2019s\nclearly established law for the California appellate court to\napprove that practice here.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion also suggests that, when a\njury is \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d the judge may provide only \u201cappro\npriate encouragement . . . to deliberate,\u201d and must refrain\nfrom providing the \u201cjudge\u2019s selective view of the evidence.\u201d\n580 F. 3d, at 1080. None of this Court\u2019s constitutional\ncases establish such a rule. And this Court\u2019s supervisory\npower cases (which, if anything, set a more demanding\nstandard than the constitutional minimum) have specifi\ncally upheld judicial comments that provide a particular\n\u201cview of the evidence\u201d to an apparently deadlocked jury.\nSee Simmons v. United States, 142 U. S. 148, 155 (1891)\n(no error where judge denied deadlocked jury\u2019s request to\nbe discharged and told them \u201cthat he regarded the testi\nmony as convincing\u201d). Nothing in this Court\u2019s clearly\nestablished law prohibits the trial judge from offering an\nopinion to a jury that is struggling to reach a verdict.\n   The Ninth Circuit was also troubled that the trial\njudge\u2019s comments appeared to be designed to address the\nconcerns of the holdout juror. 580 F. 3d, at 1082. And the\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npanel majority disapproved of the trial judge\u2019s \u201cmandatory\nlanguage\u201d directing the jury to \u201c \u2018consider and discuss\u2019 \u201d the\nevidence highlighted by the court. Id., at 1082\u20131083.\nWhatever potential for coercion these comments caused,\nthe California appellate court\u2019s decision upholding them\n\u201cwas clearly not unreasonable\u201d under the general Lowen\nfield standard. See Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). I would grant certiorari in this case and correct the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s error.\n</pre>",
