WILSON, SUPERINTENDANT, INDIANA \n\n      STATE PRISON v. JOSEPH E. CORCORAN \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 10\u201391. Decided November 8, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to\nstate prisoners whose confinement does not violate federal\nlaw. Because the Court of Appeals granted the writ to\nrespondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its\njudgment and remand.\n                        *    *     *\n  In 1997, respondent Joseph Corcoran shot and killed\nfour men, including his brother and his sister\u2019s fiance. An\nIndiana jury found him guilty of four counts of murder,\nfound the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple\nmurders, and unanimously recommended capital punish\nment. The trial judge agreed and sentenced respondent to\ndeath.\n  But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated\nthe sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have\nviolated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory\naggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.\nCorcoran v. State, 739 N. E. 2d 649, 657\u2013658 (2000).\nWhen addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court\nhad remarked:\n    \u201c \u2018[T]he knowing and intentional murders of four inno\n    cent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated\n    crime. . . . I don\u2019t think in the history of this county\n    we\u2019ve had a mass murderer such as yourself. It\n    makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass\n    murderer. And I am convinced in my heart of hearts,\n2                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    . . . if given the opportunity, you will murder again.\u2019 \u201d\n    Id., at 657 (quoting transcript).\nAccording to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial judge\u2019s\nreference to the innocence of respondent\u2019s victims, the\nheinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness\nwas not necessarily improper; it is permissible to provide\n\u201can appropriate context for consideration of the alleged\naggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d Ibid. (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). But because the trial court\nmight have meant that it weighed these factors as aggra\nvating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court re\nmanded for resentencing. See ibid.\n  On remand, the trial court issued a revised sentencing\norder. It wrote:\n    \u201c \u2018 The trial Court, in balancing the proved aggravators\n    and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court\n    that it only relied upon those proven statutory aggra\n    vators. The trial Court\u2019s remarks at the sentencing\n    hearing, and the language in the original sentencing\n    order explain why such high weight was given to the\n    statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further\n    support the trial Court\u2019s personal conclusion that the\n    sentence is appropriate punishment for this offender\n    and these crimes.\u2019 \u201d Corcoran v. State, 774 N. E. 2d\n    495, 498 (Ind. 2002) (quoting order).\nOn appeal, over respondent\u2019s objection, the Supreme Court\naccepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence. Id.,\nat 498\u2013499, 502. It explained that it was \u201cnow satisfied\nthat the trial court has relied on only aggravators listed in\nIndiana Code \u00a735\u201350\u20132\u20139(b). . . . There is no lack of clar\nity in [the trial court\u2019s] statement and no plausible reason\nto believe it untrue.\u201d Id., at 499.\n   Respondent later applied to the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His habeas petition asserted a number of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ngrounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, not\nwithstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court\nimproperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors\nwhen it resentenced him. Respondent also asserted that\nthis reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend\nments. Record, Doc. 13, p. 11. In its response to the peti\ntion, the State specifically disputed that contention. Id.,\nDoc. 33, p. 16 (\u201c[Respondent] fails to establish any consti\ntutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s re\nview of the trial court\u2019s treatment of Corcoran\u2019s sentence\non remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme\ncourt\u2019s judgment is in any way inconsistent with applica\nble United States Supreme Court precedent\u201d).\n   The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this\ndispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly dif\nferent ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the\ndeath penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a\njury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment. Corcoran v.\nBuss, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709, 725\u2013726 (2007). It did not\naddress the sentencing challenge because that was \u201cren\ndered moot\u201d by the grant of habeas relief. Id., at 734.\n   The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed\nthe District Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment ruling. Corcoran v.\nBuss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712, 714 (2008). Then, evidently\noverlooking respondent\u2019s remaining sentencing claims, the\nSeventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court\n\u201cwith instructions to deny the writ.\u201d Id., at 714. To cor\nrect this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the\nSeventh Circuit\u2019s judgment. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 558\nU. S. 1 (2009) (per curiam). We explained that the Court\nof Appeals \u201cshould have permitted the District Court to\nconsider Corcoran\u2019s unresolved challenges to his death\nsentence on remand, or should have itself explained why\nsuch consideration was unnecessary.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2).\n4                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   On remand\u2014and without any opportunity for briefing\nby the parties\u2014the Court of Appeals changed course and\ngranted habeas relief. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 593 F. 3d\n547, 555 (2010). After determining that respondent\u2019s\nsentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to\ninclude it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit\nconcluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review. Id.,\nat 551. The panel explained that, \u201cunlike the Indiana\nSupreme Court,\u201d it was unsatisfied with the trial court\u2019s\nrepresentation that it relied only on aggravating factors\nauthorized by Indiana law. Ibid. Because the trial court\u2019s\nrevised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory\nfactors of heinousness, victims\u2019 innocence, and future\ndangerousness to determine the weight given to the ag\ngravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit con\ncluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had made an\n\u201c \u2018unreasonable determination of the facts\u2019 \u201d when it ac\ncepted the trial court\u2019s representation that it did not rely\non those factors as aggravating circumstances. Ibid.\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2)). The panel therefore\nrequired the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentenc\ning determination in order to \u201cprevent non-compliance\nwith Indiana law.\u201d 593 F. 3d, at 552\u2013553.\n   But it is only noncompliance with federal law that ren\nders a State\u2019s criminal judgment susceptible to collateral\nattack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambi\nguously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to\na state prisoner \u201conly on the ground that he is in custody\nin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(a). And we have re\npeatedly held that \u201c \u2018federal habeas corpus relief does not\nlie for errors of state law.\u2019 \u201d Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.\n62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780\n(1990)). \u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court\nto reexamine state-court determinations on state-law\nquestions.\u201d 502 U. S., at 67\u201368. But here, the panel\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nopinion contained no hint that it thought the violation of\nIndiana law it had unearthed also entailed the infringe\nment of any federal right. Not only did the court frame\nrespondent\u2019s claim as whether \u201cthe Indiana trial court\nconsidered non-statutory aggravating circumstances . . . in\ncontravention of state law,\u201d 593 F. 3d, at 551 (emphasis\nadded), it also explicitly acknowledged that \u201c[n]othing in\n[its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule per\nmitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death\nsentence selection process. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.\n862, 878 (1983) (permitting their use under federal law),\u201d\nid., at 551\u2013552 (citations omitted).\n   Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an\nunreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to\navoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to\nfederal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by\nshowing that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d It does\nnot repeal the command of \u00a72254(a) that habeas relief may\nbe afforded to a state prisoner \u201conly on the ground\u201d that\nhis custody violates federal law.\n   In response to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion, the State\nfiled a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The\nState\u2019s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred\nby granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It\nalso contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wain\nwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983) (per curiam), that the\nCourt of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana\nSupreme Court\u2019s factual determination that its own trial\ncourt complied with Indiana law.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its\nopinion to include this language:\n    \u201cThis [remand for resentencing] will cure the state\n    trial court\u2019s \u2018unreasonable determination of the facts.\u2019\n6                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) [sic]. (It will also prevent non\n    compliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended\n    that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompli\n    ance with state law also violates the federal Constitu\n    tion and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a72254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any con\n    trary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464\n    U. S. 78 (1983), or any similar decision.)\u201d App. to Pet.\n    for Cert. 144a\u2013145a.\n   The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not\nenough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the exis\ntence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court\nagrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The\nSeventh Circuit\u2019s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor\ndoes it even articulate what federal right was allegedly\ninfringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the\ncourt maintains that it would not violate federal law for\nIndiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court\ndid. 593 F. 3d, at 551\u2013552.\n   In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional\nerror, the amended opinion says only that the State had\nnot \u201cadvanced any contrary argument based on Wain\nwright v. Goode . . . or any similar decision.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was\nmeant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State\nforfeited the position that respondent\u2019s allegations do not\nstate a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the\nState explicitly disputed that point before the District\nCourt\u2014the last forum in which the subject had been\nraised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that\nrespondent had waived the claim entirely. 593 F. 3d, at\n551. And there is no suggestion that the State has ever\nconceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in\naccordance with Indiana law. Under those circumstances,\nit was improper for the Court of Appeals to issue the writ\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nwithout first concluding that a violation of federal law had\nbeen established.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We express no view about the merits of the\nhabeas petition.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Not only did the court frame\nrespondent\u2019s claim as whether \u201cthe Indiana trial court\nconsidered non-statutory aggravating circumstances . . . in\ncontravention of state law,\u201d 593 F. 3d, at 551 (emphasis\nadded), it also explicitly acknowledged that \u201c[n]othing in\n[its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule per\nmitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death\nsentence selection process. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.\n862, 878 (1983) (permitting their use under federal law),\u201d\nid., at 551\u2013552 (citations omitted).\n   Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an\nunreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to\navoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to\nfederal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by\nshowing that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d It does\nnot repeal the command of \u00a72254(a) that habeas relief may\nbe afforded to a state prisoner \u201conly on the ground\u201d that\nhis custody violates federal law.\n   In response to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion, the State\nfiled a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The\nState\u2019s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred\nby granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It\nalso contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wain\nwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983) (per curiam), that the\nCourt of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana\nSupreme Court\u2019s factual determination that its own trial\ncourt complied with Indiana law.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its\nopinion to include this language:\n    \u201cThis [remand for resentencing] will cure the state\n    trial court\u2019s \u2018unreasonable determination of the facts.\u2019\n6                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) [sic]. (It will also prevent non\n    compliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended\n    that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompli\n    ance with state law also violates the federal Constitu\n    tion and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a72254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any con\n    trary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464\n    U.

It is not\nenough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the exis\ntence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court\nagrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The\nSeventh Circuit\u2019s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor\ndoes it even articulate what federal right was allegedly\ninfringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the\ncourt maintains that it would not violate federal law for\nIndiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court\ndid. 593 F. 3d, at 551\u2013552.\n   In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional\nerror, the amended opinion says only that the State had\nnot \u201cadvanced any contrary argument based on Wain\nwright v. Goode . . . or any similar decision.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was\nmeant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State\nforfeited the position that respondent\u2019s allegations do not\nstate a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the\nState explicitly disputed that point before the District\nCourt\u2014the last forum in which the subject had been\nraised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that\nrespondent had waived the claim entirely. 593 F. 3d, at\n551. And there is no suggestion that the State has ever\nconceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in\naccordance with Indiana law.
