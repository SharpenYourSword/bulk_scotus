CORCORAN \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 10–91. Decided November 8, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Federal courts may not issue writs of habeas corpus to\nstate prisoners whose confinement does not violate federal\nlaw. Because the Court of Appeals granted the writ to\nrespondent without finding such a violation, we vacate its\njudgment and remand.\n                        *    *     *\n  In 1997, respondent Joseph Corcoran shot and killed\nfour men, including his brother and his sister’s fiance. An\nIndiana jury found him guilty of four counts of murder,\nfound the statutory aggravating circumstance of multiple\nmurders, and unanimously recommended capital punish\nment. The trial judge agreed and sentenced respondent to\ndeath.\n  But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated\nthe sentence out of concern that the trial judge might have\nviolated Indiana law by relying partly on nonstatutory\naggravating factors when imposing the death penalty.\nCorcoran v. State, 739 N. E. 2d 649, 657–658 (2000).\nWhen addressing respondent at sentencing, the trial court\nhad remarked:\n    “ ‘[T]he knowing and intentional murders of four inno\n    cent people is an extremely heinous and aggravated\n    crime. . . . I don’t think in the history of this county\n    we’ve had a mass murderer such as yourself. It\n    makes you, Mr. Corcoran, a very dangerous, evil mass\n    murderer. And I am convinced in my heart of hearts,\n2                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    . . . if given the opportunity, you will murder again.’ ”\n    Id., at 657 (quoting transcript).\nAccording to the Indiana Supreme Court, the trial judge’s\nreference to the innocence of respondent’s victims, the\nheinousness of his offense, and his future dangerousness\nwas not necessarily improper; it is permissible to provide\n“an appropriate context for consideration of the alleged\naggravating and mitigating circumstances.” Ibid. (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). But because the trial court\nmight have meant that it weighed these factors as aggra\nvating circumstances, the Indiana Supreme Court re\nmanded for resentencing. See ibid.\n  On remand, the trial court issued a revised sentencing\norder. It wrote:\n    “ ‘ The trial Court, in balancing the proved aggravators\n    and mitigators, emphasizes to the Supreme Court\n    that it only relied upon those proven statutory aggra\n    vators. The trial Court’s remarks at the sentencing\n    hearing, and the language in the original sentencing\n    order explain why such high weight was given to the\n    statutory aggravator of multiple murder, and further\n    support the trial Court’s personal conclusion that the\n    sentence is appropriate punishment for this offender\n    and these crimes.’ ” Corcoran v. State, 774 N. E. 2d\n    495, 498 (Ind. 2002) (quoting order).\nOn appeal, over respondent’s objection, the Supreme Court\naccepted this explanation and affirmed the sentence. Id.,\nat 498–499, 502. It explained that it was “now satisfied\nthat the trial court has relied on only aggravators listed in\nIndiana Code §35–50–2–9(b). . . . There is no lack of clar\nity in [the trial court’s] statement and no plausible reason\nto believe it untrue.” Id., at 499.\n   Respondent later applied to the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Indiana for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His habeas petition asserted a number of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ngrounds for relief, including a renewed claim that, not\nwithstanding its assurances to the contrary, the trial court\nimproperly relied on nonstatutory aggravating factors\nwhen it resentenced him. Respondent also asserted that\nthis reliance violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend\nments. Record, Doc. 13, p. 11. In its response to the peti\ntion, the State specifically disputed that contention. Id.,\nDoc. 33, p. 16 (“[Respondent] fails to establish any consti\ntutional deficiency in [the] Indiana Supreme Court’s re\nview of the trial court’s treatment of Corcoran’s sentence\non remand, let alone does it show that the state supreme\ncourt’s judgment is in any way inconsistent with applica\nble United States Supreme Court precedent”).\n   The District Court, however, had no need to resolve this\ndispute because it granted habeas relief on a wholly dif\nferent ground: that an offer by the prosecutor to take the\ndeath penalty off the table in exchange for a waiver of a\njury trial had violated the Sixth Amendment. Corcoran v.\nBuss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334345/corcoran-v-buss/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It did not\naddress the sentencing challenge because that was “ren\ndered moot” by the grant of habeas relief. Id., at 734.\n   The State appealed, and the Seventh Circuit reversed\nthe District Court’s Sixth Amendment ruling. Corcoran v.\nBuss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712, 714 (2008). Then, evidently\noverlooking respondent’s remaining sentencing claims, the\nSeventh Circuit remanded the case to the District Court\n“with instructions to deny the writ.” Id., at 714. To cor\nrect this oversight, we granted certiorari and vacated the\nSeventh Circuit’s judgment. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 558\nU. S. 1 (2009) (per curiam). We explained that the Court\nof Appeals “should have permitted the District Court to\nconsider Corcoran’s unresolved challenges to his death\nsentence on remand, or should have itself explained why\nsuch consideration was unnecessary.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2).\n4                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   On remand—and without any opportunity for briefing\nby the parties—the Court of Appeals changed course and\ngranted habeas relief. Corcoran v. Levenhagen, 593 F. 3d\n547, 555 (2010). After determining that respondent’s\nsentencing challenge had been waived by his failure to\ninclude it in his original cross-appeal, the Seventh Circuit\nconcluded that the claim satisfied plain-error review. Id.,\nat 551. The panel explained that, “unlike the Indiana\nSupreme Court,” it was unsatisfied with the trial court’s\nrepresentation that it relied only on aggravating factors\nauthorized by Indiana law. Ibid. Because the trial court’s\nrevised sentencing order said that it used the nonstatutory\nfactors of heinousness, victims’ innocence, and future\ndangerousness to determine the weight given to the ag\ngravator of multiple murders, the Seventh Circuit con\ncluded that the Indiana Supreme Court had made an\n“ ‘unreasonable determination of the facts’ ” when it ac\ncepted the trial court’s representation that it did not rely\non those factors as aggravating circumstances. Ibid.\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)). The panel therefore\nrequired the Indiana trial court to reconsider its sentenc\ning determination in order to “prevent non-compliance\nwith Indiana law.” 593 F. 3d, at 552–553.\n   But it is only noncompliance with federal law that ren\nders a State’s criminal judgment susceptible to collateral\nattack in the federal courts. The habeas statute unambi\nguously provides that a federal court may issue the writ to\na state prisoner “only on the ground that he is in custody\nin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(a). And we have re\npeatedly held that “ ‘federal habeas corpus relief does not\nlie for errors of state law.’ ” Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.\n62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780\n(1990)). “[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court\nto reexamine state-court determinations on state-law\nquestions.” 502 U. S., at 67–68.

Not only did the court frame\nrespondent’s claim as whether “the Indiana trial court\nconsidered non-statutory aggravating circumstances . . . in\ncontravention of state law,” 593 F. 3d, at 551 (emphasis\nadded), it also explicitly acknowledged that “[n]othing in\n[its] opinion prevents Indiana from adopting a rule per\nmitting the use of non-statutory aggravators in the death\nsentence selection process. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.\n862, 878 (1983) (permitting their use under federal law),”\nid., at 551–552 (citations omitted).\n   Nor did it suffice for the Court of Appeals to find an\nunreasonable determination of the facts under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(2). That provision allows habeas petitioners to\navoid the bar to habeas relief imposed with respect to\nfederal claims adjudicated on the merits in state court by\nshowing that the state court’s decision was “based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.” It does\nnot repeal the command of §2254(a) that habeas relief may\nbe afforded to a state prisoner “only on the ground” that\nhis custody violates federal law.\n   In response to the Seventh Circuit’s opinion, the State\nfiled a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The\nState’s petition argued that the Seventh Circuit had erred\nby granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It\nalso contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wain\nwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78 (1983) (per curiam), that the\nCourt of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana\nSupreme Court’s factual determination that its own trial\ncourt complied with Indiana law.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing, but amended its\nopinion to include this language:\n    “This [remand for resentencing] will cure the state\n    trial court’s ‘unreasonable determination of the facts.’\n6                  WILSON v. CORCORAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) [sic]. (It will also prevent non\n    compliance with Indiana law. [Corcoran] contended\n    that, under the circumstances of this case, noncompli\n    ance with state law also violates the federal Constitu\n    tion and thus warrants him relief under 28 U. S. C.\n    §2254(d)(2). [The State] has not advanced any con\n    trary argument based on Wainwright v. Goode, 464\n    U. S. 78 (1983), or any similar decision.)” App. to Pet.\n    for Cert. 144a–145a.\n   The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not\nenough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the exis\ntence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court\nagrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The\nSeventh Circuit’s opinion reflects no such agreement, nor\ndoes it even articulate what federal right was allegedly\ninfringed. In fact, as to one possible federal claim, the\ncourt maintains that it would not violate federal law for\nIndiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the trial court\ndid. 593 F. 3d, at 551–552.\n   In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional\nerror, the amended opinion says only that the State had\nnot “advanced any contrary argument based on Wain\nwright v. Goode . . . or any similar decision.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 145a. It is not clear what this language was\nmeant to convey. It cannot have meant that the State\nforfeited the position that respondent’s allegations do not\nstate a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the\nState explicitly disputed that point before the District\nCourt—the last forum in which the subject had been\nraised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that\nrespondent had waived the claim entirely. 593 F. 3d, at\n551. And there is no suggestion that the State has ever\nconceded the existence of a federal right to be sentenced in\naccordance with Indiana law.
