UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09\u2013479.      Argued October 4, 2010\u2014Decided November 15, 2010*\nPetitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,\n  were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a\n  deadly weapon in connection with \u201cany crime of violence or drug traf\n  ficking crime,\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1). The minimum prison term for a \u00a7924(c) of\n  fense is five years, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \u201cany other term of\n  imprisonment imposed on the [offender],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Abbott\n  was convicted on the \u00a7924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking\n  counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a\n  15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession con\n  viction and an additional five years for his \u00a7924(c) violation. Gould\u2019s\n  predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory mini\n  mum sentence; he received an additional five years for his \u00a7924(c)\n  violation. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their \u00a7924(c) sen\n  tences, resting their objections on the \u201cexcept\u201d clause prefacing\n  \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five\n  year term as a consecutive sentence \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a\n  greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself] or\n  by any other provision of law.\u201d Abbott urged that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\n  was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said\n  the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking\n  crime. The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott\u2019s sentence, concluding that\n  the \u201cexcept\u201d clause \u201crefers only to other minimum sentences that may\n  be imposed\u201d for \u00a7924(c) violations. Gould fared no better before the\n  Fifth Circuit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 09\u20137073, Gould v. United States, on certiorari to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n2                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum speci\n fied for his conduct in \u00a7924(c), unless another provision of law di\n rected to conduct proscribed by \u00a7924(c) imposes an even greater\n mandatory minimum. Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of\n 1968, but the \u201cexcept\u201d clause was not added until 1998. Under the\n pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not\n preempt \u00a7924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been\n correctly sentenced under \u00a7924(c). The question here is whether\n Congress\u2019 1998 reformulation of \u00a7924(c) rendered their sentences ex\n cessive. The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United\n States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that \u00a7924(c)(1)\u2019s ban on \u201cuse\u201d of a\n firearm did not reach \u201cmere possession\u201d of a weapon, id., at 144. In\n addition to bringing possession within the statute\u2019s compass, Con\n gress increased the severity of \u00a7924(c) sentences by changing \u201conce\n mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,\u201d United\n States v. O\u2019Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences\n for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.\n Congress also restructured the provision, \u201cdivid[ing] what was once a\n lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,\u201d id., at ___,\n and it added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause at issue. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The leading portion of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause now prefacing\n \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) refers to a \u201cgreater minimum sentence . . . otherwise\n provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself]\u201d; the second segment of the clause refers\n to a greater minimum provided outside \u00a7924(c) \u201cby any other provi\n sion of law.\u201d To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is\n \u201cotherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,\u201d the key ques\n tion is: otherwise provided for what? Most courts have answered: for\n the conduct \u00a7924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection\n with a predicate crime.\n    Abbott and Gould disagree. Gould would apply the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\n whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater\n minimum sentence. Abbott argues that the minimum sentence \u201coth\n erwise provided\u201d must be one imposed for the criminal transaction\n that triggered \u00a7924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense in\n volving the same firearm that triggered \u00a7924(c). These three inter\n pretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress\n in 1998 adopted a less aggressive mode of applying \u00a7924(c), one that\n significantly reduced the severity of the provision\u2019s impact on defen\n dants. The pre-1998 version of \u00a7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence\n to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime\n or any separate firearm conviction. It is unlikely that Congress\n meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \u201cAn Act [t]o throttle\n criminal use of guns,\u201d to effect a departure so great from \u00a7924(c)\u2019s\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\noriginal insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punish\nment for \u00a7924(c) violations. Abbott\u2019s and Gould\u2019s readings would un\ndercut that same bill\u2019s primary objective: to expand \u00a7924(c)\u2019s coverage\nto reach firearm possession. Their readings would also result in sen\ntencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend. Section 924(c), as\nthey construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct\nthat provision makes independently criminal. Stranger still, the\nworst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave\noffenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction\nwould be most likely to preempt \u00a7924(c) sentences. Abbott and Gould\nrespond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies\nand order appropriate adjustments. While a judge exercising discre\ntion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) would not be required to sentence a\nmore culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Con\ngress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discre\ntion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on \u00a73553(a).\nAbbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have an\nticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve dispari\nties by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.\nBut Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when\nit amended \u00a7924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate\ncrime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement. Between 1984 and\n1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of\n\u00a7924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm en\nhancement might suffice to accomplish \u00a7924(c)\u2019s objective. Nor is\nthere any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guide\nlines\u2019 relationship to \u00a7924(c) when it added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause.\nPp. 8\u201314.\n   (c) The Government\u2019s reading\u2014that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause is triggered\nonly when another provision commands a longer term for conduct vio\nlating \u00a7924(c)\u2014makes far more sense. It gives effect to statutory\nlanguage commanding that all \u00a7924(c) offenders shall receive addi\ntional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command re\niterated three times: First, the statute states that the \u00a7924(c)(1) pun\nishment \u201cshall\u201d be imposed \u201cin addition to\u201d the penalty for the\npredicate offense, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A); second, \u00a7924(c) demands a discrete\npunishment even if the predicate crime itself \u201cprovides for an en\nhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous\nweapon or device,\u201d ibid.; third, \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibil\nity that a \u00a7924(c) sentence might \u201crun concurrently with any other\nterm of imprisonment.\u201d Interpreting the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to train on\nconduct offending \u00a7924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.\nThe clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct\n4                     ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u00a7924(c) proscribes. See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534\u2013\n    535. There is strong contextual support for the view that the \u201cexcept\u201d\n    clause was intended simply to clarify \u00a7924(c). At the same time Con\n    gress added the clause, it made the rest of \u00a7924(c) more complex, di\n    viding its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and\n    adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.\n    Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges:\n    It added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\u2019s initial part, which covers greater mini\n    mums provided \u201cby this subsection,\u201d to instruct judges not to stack\n    ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the\n    same weapon. In referencing greater minimums provided by \u201cany\n    other provision of law,\u201d the second portion of the clause simply fur\n    nishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which \u00a7924(c)\n    and a different statute both punish conduct offending \u00a7924(c). Con\n    gress likely anticipated such cases when framing the \u201cexcept\u201d clause,\n    for the bill that reformulated \u00a7924(c)\u2019s text also amended 18 U. S. C.\n    \u00a73559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons con\n    victed of \u201cfirearms possession (as described in \u00a7924(c)).\u201d This inter\n    pretation does not render the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\u2019s second part effectively\n    meaningless. Though \u00a73559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of\n    \u00a7924(c) itself, that the Government places within the \u201cexcept\u201d clause,\n    the \u201cany other provision of law\u201d portion installs a safety valve for ad\n    ditional sentences that Congress may codify outside \u00a7924(c) in the fu\n    ture. Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of\n    Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion.

S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1). The minimum prison term\nfor the offense described in \u00a7924(c) is five years,\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \u201cany other term of impris\nonment imposed on the [offender],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). The\ntwo consolidated cases before us call for interpretation of\n\u00a7924(c) as that provision was reformulated in 1998.\n  Kevin Abbott and Carlos Rashad Gould, petitioners\nhere, defendants below, were charged with multiple drug\n2                ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand firearm offenses; charges on which they were con\nvicted included violation of \u00a7924(c). Each objected to the\nimposition of any additional prison time for his \u00a7924(c)\nconviction. Their objections rested on the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\nnow prefacing \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Under that clause, a mini\nmum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive\nsentence \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum\nsentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself] or by any\nother provision of law.\u201d\n   Abbott and Gould read \u00a7924(c)\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause to se\ncure them against prison time for their \u00a7924(c) convic\ntions. They claim exemption from punishment under\n\u00a7924(c) because they were sentenced to greater mandatory\nminimum prison terms for convictions on other counts\ncharging different offenses. The \u201cexcept\u201d clause, they\nurge, ensures that \u00a7924(c) offenders will serve at least five\nyears in prison. If conviction on a different count yields a\nmandatory sentence exceeding five years, they maintain,\nthe statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty\nspecified for the \u00a7924(c) violation becomes inoperative.\n   The courts below, agreeing with the Government\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute, read \u00a7924(c)(1) as independ\nently requiring a sentence of at least five years, tacked\nonto any other sentence the defendant receives. The\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause refers to \u201ca greater minimum sentence . . .\notherwise provided.\u201d \u201c[O]therwise provided\u201d for what, the\ncourts below asked; their answer, for conduct offending\n\u00a7924(c), i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a\ncrime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.\n   A defendant is not spared from a separate, consecutive\nsentence for a \u00a7924(c) conviction, the lower courts deter\nmined, whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum\nfor a different count of conviction. Instead, according to\nthe courts below and the Government here, the \u201cexcept\u201d\nclause applies only when another provision\u2014whether\ncontained within or placed outside \u00a7924(c)\u2014commands a\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlonger term for conduct violating \u00a7924(c). For example,\nthe mandatory minimum sentence for a \u00a7924(c) offense is\nfive years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum\nrises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to\nten years. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii). A defendant who\npossessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in viola\ntion of \u00a7924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum\nterm of ten years.\n   We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line\nwith the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defen\ndant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a\n\u00a7924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by\nvirtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a\ndifferent count of conviction. Under the \u201cexcept\u201d clause as\nwe comprehend it, a \u00a7924(c) offender is not subject to\nstacked sentences for violating \u00a7924(c). If he possessed,\nbrandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty\nwould be 10 years, not 22. He is, however, subject to the\nhighest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in\n\u00a7924(c), unless another provision of law directed to con\nduct proscribed by \u00a7924(c) imposes an even greater man\ndatory minimum.\n                             I\n   Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,\nwere each charged with violating \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i) by pos\nsessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\ncrime. Abbott\u2019s case was tried to a jury in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania, which convicted him on the\n\u00a7924(c) count and three others: two predicate trafficking\ncounts, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841, 846, and being a felon in posses\nsion of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g). Given Abbott\u2019s\nextensive criminal history, his felon-in-possession convic\ntion triggered a 15-year mandatory minimum under the\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e).\nThe District Court sentenced Abbott to the 15 years man\n4                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndated by ACCA, and to an additional five years for the\n\u00a7924(c) violation, yielding a total prison term of 20 years.1\n  Gould\u2019s indictment listed seven separate drug and fire\narm charges. In return for Gould\u2019s agreement to plead\nguilty, the Government dropped all but two: one \u00a7924(c)\noffense and one predicate drug-trafficking crime. The\nlatter, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\ncocaine base, carried a ten-year mandatory minimum\nunder \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Firearm involvement was not an\nelement of that offense. The United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Texas imposed a sentence of\n11 years and 5 months for the trafficking offense and an\nadditional five years for the \u00a7924(c) violation, for a total of\n16 years and 5 months.\n  On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year\nconsecutive sentence each received under \u00a7924(c). Abbott\nurged that ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum triggered\n\u00a7924(c)\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause, because ACCA qualified as\n\u201c[an]other provision of law\u201d that \u201cprovided\u201d a \u201cgreater\nminimum sentence.\u201d Gould said the same of the ten years\ncommanded by his predicate trafficking crime.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Cir\ncuit affirmed Abbott\u2019s sentence, concluding that the \u201cex\ncept\u201d clause \u201crefers only to other minimum sentences that\nmay be imposed for violations of \u00a7924(c).\u201d United States v.\nAbbott, 574 F. 3d 203, 208 (2009).

Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\n    . . . the term of imprisonment imposed under this sub\n    section [shall not] run concurrently with any other\n    term of imprisonment including that imposed for\n    the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in\n    which the firearm was used or carried.\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)\n    (1994 ed.).\nIf this pre-1998 text governed, all agree, separate counts of\nconviction would have no preemptive force, and Abbott\nand Gould would have been correctly sentenced under\n\u00a7924(c). The question we confront is whether Congress\u2019\n1998 reformulation of \u00a7924(c) rendered the sentences\nimposed on Abbott and Gould excessive.\n   The 1998 alteration responded primarily to our decision\nin Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). In pro\nscribing \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm, Bailey held, \u00a7924(c)(1) did not\nreach \u201cmere possession\u201d of the weapon. Id., at 144. Con\ngress legislated a different result; in the 1998 revision,\n\u201ccolloquially known as the Bailey Fix Act,\u201d the Legislature\nbrought possession within the statute\u2019s compass.

And it added the prefatory \u201cexcept\u201d\nclause at issue in the cases now before us.

The \u201cexcept\u201d clause, it is therefore undis\nputed, \u201chas to have some understood referent to be intelli\ngible.\u201d United States v. Parker, 549 F. 3d 5, 11 (CA1\n2008). What should that referent be? As we comprehend\nthe clause, to determine whether a greater minimum\nsentence is \u201cotherwise provided . . . by any other provision\nof law,\u201d the key question one must ask is: otherwise pro\nvided for what? As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, most\ncourts, in line with the courts below and the Government,\nhave answered: for the conduct \u00a7924(c) proscribes, i.e.,\npossessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.\n   Abbott and Gould disagree and offer diverse readings.\nGould principally would apply the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to pre\nclude a \u00a7924(c) sentence whenever \u201cany of a defendant\u2019s\ncounts of convictio[n] at sentencing\u201d require a greater\nminimum sentence. Brief for Petitioner in No. 09\u20137073,\np. 14 (hereinafter Gould Brief).\n   In lieu of Gould\u2019s position that any greater minimum\nsentence on a different count of conviction will do, Abbott\nadvances a somewhat narrower \u201ctransactional approach.\u201d\nAny sentence imposed on the defendant fits the bill, he\nurges, so long as the sentence was imposed \u201cbecause of the\ncriminal transaction that triggered \u00a7924(c) in the first\nplace.\u201d Abbott Brief 10. Accord United States v. Williams,\n558 F. 3d 166, 171 (CA2 2009).\n   Abbott also tenders an alternative construction: The\nminimum sentence \u201cotherwise provided\u201d must be for a\nfirearm offense\u2014for example, Abbott\u2019s felon-in-possession\ncharge\u2014involving the same firearm that triggered\n\u00a7924(c).4 Conceding that this reading is \u201cnot commanded\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Because   Gould\u2019s only firearm-related offense is his \u00a7924(c) offense,\n10                  ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby the [statute\u2019s] plain language,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,\nAbbott asserts that it advances \u00a7924(c)\u2019s goal\u2014to discour\nage bearing arms in furtherance of crime\u2014while avoiding\nthe imposition of \u201ctwo consecutive mandatory minimum\nsentences for the single use of a single firearm,\u201d Abbott\nBrief 47 (emphasis omitted).\n   The three interpretations just described share a com\nmon premise. In adding the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in 1998, all\nthree posit, Congress adopted a less aggressive mode of\napplying \u00a7924(c), one that significantly reduced the sever\nity of the provision\u2019s impact on defendants. Like the\ncourts below, we regard this premise as implausible. As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5\u20136, the pre-1998 version of\n\u00a7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence\u2014punishment to be\nimposed regardless of the sentence received for the predi\ncate crime or any separate firearm conviction. Abbott and\nGould think the \u201cexcept\u201d clause installed, instead, a mod\nest scheme designed simply to ensure that all \u00a7924(c)\noffenders \u201cserve at least 5 years in prison.\u201d Gould Brief 5;\nsee Abbott Brief 10. We doubt that Congress meant a\nprefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \u201cAn Act [t]o throt\ntle criminal use of guns,\u201d to effect a departure so great\nfrom \u00a7924(c)\u2019s longstanding thrust, i.e., its insistence that\nsentencing judges impose additional punishment for\n\u00a7924(c) violations.\n   Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by\nAbbott or Gould, it bears emphasis, we would undercut\nthat same bill\u2019s primary objective: to expand \u00a7924(c)\u2019s\ncoverage to reach firearm possession. In 1999, more than\nhalf of those who violated \u00a7924(c) in connection with a\ndrug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of\nten years or more for that trafficking offense. Letter from\nGlenn R. Schmitt, United States Sentencing Commission,\nto Supreme Court Library (Nov. 10, 2010) (available in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nGould\u2019s sentence would stand under Abbott\u2019s alternative construction. \n\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Congress, however, imposed\nonly a five-year minimum for firearm possession \u201cin fur\ntherance of\u201d a drug offense. As construed by Abbott and\nGould, the amendment to include firearm possession as a\n\u00a7924(c) offense would spare the most serious drug offend\ners from any discrete punishment for the very firearm\nactivity the amendment targeted. \u201cWe are disinclined to\nsay that what Congress imposed with one hand . . . it\nwithdrew with the other . . . .\u201d Logan v. United States, 552\nU. S. 23, 35 (2007).\n   Abbott\u2019s and Gould\u2019s proposed readings, moreover,\nwould result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did\nnot intend. We note first that \u00a7924(c), as they construe it,\nwould often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that\nprovision makes independently criminal. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n52. For example, an individual who sold enough drugs to\nreceive a ten-year minimum sentence under \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\ncould, so far as \u00a7924(c) is concerned, possess or even bran\ndish a gun without incurring any additional punishment.\n   Stranger still, under the Abbott and Gould readings, the\nworst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences.\nConsider two defendants convicted of trafficking in co\ncaine. The first possesses 500 grams and is subject to a\nmandatory minimum of five years, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B); the\nsecond possesses five kilograms and is subject to a manda\ntory minimum of ten years, \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Both brandish\nfirearms, calling for a sentence of seven years under\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(ii). The first defendant, under all readings,\nwill spend at least 12 years in prison. The second defen\ndant\u2019s ten-year drug minimum, according to Abbott and\nGould, triggers the \u201cexcept\u201d clause and wipes out that\ndefendant\u2019s \u00a7924(c) penalty; though the more culpable of\nthe two, the second defendant\u2019s minimum term would be\njust ten years. Brief for United States 40. Like the Third\nCircuit below, \u201c[w]e are confident that Congress did not\nintend such a bizarre result.\u201d 574 F. 3d, at 209.\n12                  ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Abbott\u2019s alternative construction, which homes in on\nother firearm offenses, gives rise to similar oddities. On\nthis reading, Abbott\u2019s 15-year ACCA sentence for being a\nfelon-in-possession would preempt his five-year \u00a7924(c)\nsentence, and his minimum term would be 15 years,\nrather than 20.5 But if ACCA were not at issue, Abbott\u2019s\nminimum term would be the same 15 years: his five-\nyear \u00a7924(c) sentence on top of his ten-year drug sen\ntence. Qualification as a career criminal would carry no\nconsequence.\n   Nor does Abbott\u2019s second construction necessarily pro\nmote more equitable outcomes. Suppose, for example, that\na career criminal sold drugs together with a first-time\noffender, and both brandished firearms in the process.\nThe first-time offender, lacking a felon-in-possession\nconviction, would serve a seven-year \u00a7924(c) sentence on\ntop of a ten-year drug sentence, for a total of 17 years. But\nthe career criminal\u2019s ACCA sentence would preempt the\n\u00a7924(c) sentence; he would serve only 15 years.\n   Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may\ntake account of such anomalies and order appropriate\nadjustments. We observe first that no correction or avoid\nance appears possible for the anomaly that, while \u00a7924(c)\n\u201cdefines a standalone crime,\u201d a \u00a7924(c) sentence would be\nwiped out by a wholly separate and independent convic\ntion. United States v. Easter, 553 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA7\n2009) (per curiam) (\u201cA determination of guilt that yields\nno sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.\u201d). We\ndo, however, agree that a judge exercising discretion un\nder 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) \u201cwould [not] be required to sen\ntence\u201d a more culpable defendant to a lesser term; the\njudge could increase that defendant\u2019s sentence for a predi\ncate crime to make up for \u00a7924(c)\u2019s failure to effect any\nenlargement of the time served. United States v. Whitley,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 ACCA   sentences may run concurrently with drug sentences.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

But we doubt Congress\nhad such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before we\nheld, in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), that\ndistrict courts have discretion to depart from the Sentenc\ning Guidelines on the basis of \u00a73553(a).\n   Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress\ncould have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guide\nlines would resolve disparities. See Abbott Brief 32\u201335;\nGould Brief 30\u201332. On this view, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\nensures that a \u00a7924(c) offender incurs a minimum sen\ntence of considerable length; the Guidelines would then\ncontrol, elevating that sentence based on firearm posses\nsion or use. See United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1998)\n(increasing offense level for defendants who use or possess\nfirearms in course of violent crime or drug trafficking);\n\u00a7\u00a72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov. 2009) (same).\n   We do not gainsay that Abbott and Gould project a\nrational, less harsh, mode of sentencing. But we do not\nthink it was the mode Congress ordered. Congress ex\npressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it\namended \u00a7924(c) in the same law that created the Sen\ntencing Commission and the Guidelines. Pub. L. 98\u2013473,\n98 Stat. 1987, 2138. Four years earlier, in Busic v. United\nStates, 446 U. S. 398, 404 (1980), we had read \u00a7924(c) to\nimpose no penalty when the predicate crime itself pre\nscribed a firearm enhancement; similarly, Abbott and\nGould now read \u00a7924(c) to impose no penalty when the\nGuidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predi\ncate sentence. The 1984 legislation \u201crepudiated\u201d Busic,\nclarifying that \u00a7924(c) applied even when the predicate\ncrime already \u201cprovides for an enhanced punishment if\ncommitted by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or\ndevice.\u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 10 (1997)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach\n14                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nor increased the severity of \u00a7924(c) on four occasions,\nnever suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement\nmight suffice to accomplish \u00a7924(c)\u2019s objective.6 Nor is\nthere the slightest indication that Congress was contem\nplating the Guidelines\u2019 relationship to \u00a7924(c) when it\nadded the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in the 1998 amendments.7\n   The \u201cexcept\u201d clause, we note, would have been a most\nhaphazard way to achieve a Guidelines-driven rollback of\n\u00a7924(c). If Congress wanted to ensure that \u00a7924(c) offend\ners \u201creceive at least five years in prison,\u201d and to rely on\nthe Guidelines for the rest, Abbott Brief 10, there was an\nobvious solution: Congress could have excised all prescrip\ntions ordering that \u00a7924(c) sentences shall run consecu\ntively to other sentences.

First, the statute states\nthat the punishment specified in \u00a7924(c)(1) \u201cshall\u201d be\nimposed \u201cin addition to\u201d the penalty for the predicate\noffense. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Second, after Busic, \u00a7924(c) de\nmands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime\nitself \u201cprovides for an enhanced punishment if committed\nby the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.\u201d\nIbid. Third, \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that\na \u00a7924(c) sentence might \u201crun concurrently with any other\nterm of imprisonment.\u201d We doubt that Congress, having\nretained this thrice-repeated instruction, would simulta\nneously provide an exception severely limiting application\nof the instruction.      Cf. Greenlaw v. United States,\n554 U.

Villa, 589 F. 3d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009).\n   There is strong contextual support for our view that\nCongress intended the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to serve simply as a\nclarification of \u00a7924(c), not as a major restraint on the\nstatute\u2019s operation. At the same time Congress added the\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause, it made the rest of \u00a7924(c) more complex.\nThe 1998 revision divided the statute\u2019s existing sentencing\nprescriptions into four paragraphs in lieu of one, and\nadded new penalties for brandishing and discharging a\nfirearm. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)\u2013(D). We know that Congress\nthought the restructuring might confuse sentencing\njudges: Warding off confusion, all agree, was the Legisla\nture\u2019s sole objective in adding the initial part of the \u201cex\ncept\u201d clause, which covers greater minimums provided \u201cby\nthis subsection.\u201d That portion of the clause instructs\njudges to pick the single highest sentence stipulated for a\n\u00a7924(c) violation within \u00a7924(c) itself, and not to stack ten\nyears for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing\nthe same weapon, whenever a defendant does both.\n   In referencing greater minimums provided by \u201cany other\nprovision of law,\u201d we think, the second portion of the\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking\ninstruction for cases in which \u00a7924(c) and a different\nstatute both punish conduct offending \u00a7924(c). Congress\nlikely anticipated such cases when the \u201cexcept\u201d clause was\nframed in 1998, for the bill that reformulated the text of\n\u00a7924(c) did just one thing more: It amended 18 U. S.

Argued October 4, 2010\u2014Decided November 15, 2010*\nPetitioners Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,\n  were charged with drug and firearm offenses, including violation of\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a\n  deadly weapon in connection with \u201cany crime of violence or drug traf\n  ficking crime,\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1). The minimum prison term for a \u00a7924(c) of\n  fense is five years, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \u201cany other term of\n  imprisonment imposed on the [offender],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Abbott\n  was convicted on the \u00a7924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking\n  counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received a\n  15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession con\n  viction and an additional five years for his \u00a7924(c) violation. Gould\u2019s\n  predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory mini\n  mum sentence; he received an additional five years for his \u00a7924(c)\n  violation. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their \u00a7924(c) sen\n  tences, resting their objections on the \u201cexcept\u201d clause prefacing\n  \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five\n  year term as a consecutive sentence \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a\n  greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself] or\n  by any other provision of law.\u201d Abbott urged that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\n  was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said\n  the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking\n  crime. The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott\u2019s sentence, concluding that\n  the \u201cexcept\u201d clause \u201crefers only to other minimum sentences that may\n  be imposed\u201d for \u00a7924(c) violations. Gould fared no better before the\n  Fifth Circuit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 09\u20137073, Gould v. United States, on certiorari to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n2                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum speci\n fied for his conduct in \u00a7924(c), unless another provision of law di\n rected to conduct proscribed by \u00a7924(c) imposes an even greater\n mandatory minimum. Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of\n 1968, but the \u201cexcept\u201d clause was not added until 1998. Under the\n pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not\n preempt \u00a7924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been\n correctly sentenced under \u00a7924(c). The question here is whether\n Congress\u2019 1998 reformulation of \u00a7924(c) rendered their sentences ex\n cessive. The 1998 alteration responded primarily to Bailey v. United\n States, 516 U. S. 137, which held that \u00a7924(c)(1)\u2019s ban on \u201cuse\u201d of a\n firearm did not reach \u201cmere possession\u201d of a weapon, id., at 144. In\n addition to bringing possession within the statute\u2019s compass, Con\n gress increased the severity of \u00a7924(c) sentences by changing \u201conce\n mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,\u201d United\n States v. O\u2019Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences\n for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.\n Congress also restructured the provision, \u201cdivid[ing] what was once a\n lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,\u201d id., at ___,\n and it added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause at issue. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The leading portion of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause now prefacing\n \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) refers to a \u201cgreater minimum sentence . . . otherwise\n provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself]\u201d; the second segment of the clause refers\n to a greater minimum provided outside \u00a7924(c) \u201cby any other provi\n sion of law.\u201d To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is\n \u201cotherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,\u201d the key ques\n tion is: otherwise provided for what? Most courts have answered: for\n the conduct \u00a7924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection\n with a predicate crime.\n    Abbott and Gould disagree. Gould would apply the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\n whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater\n minimum sentence. Abbott argues that the minimum sentence \u201coth\n erwise provided\u201d must be one imposed for the criminal transaction\n that triggered \u00a7924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense in\n volving the same firearm that triggered \u00a7924(c). These three inter\n pretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress\n in 1998 adopted a less aggressive mode of applying \u00a7924(c), one that\n significantly reduced the severity of the provision\u2019s impact on defen\n dants. The pre-1998 version of \u00a7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence\n to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime\n or any separate firearm conviction. It is unlikely that Congress\n meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \u201cAn Act [t]o throttle\n criminal use of guns,\u201d to effect a departure so great from \u00a7924(c)\u2019s\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\noriginal insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punish\nment for \u00a7924(c) violations. Abbott\u2019s and Gould\u2019s readings would un\ndercut that same bill\u2019s primary objective: to expand \u00a7924(c)\u2019s coverage\nto reach firearm possession. Their readings would also result in sen\ntencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend. Section 924(c), as\nthey construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct\nthat provision makes independently criminal. Stranger still, the\nworst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave\noffenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction\nwould be most likely to preempt \u00a7924(c) sentences. Abbott and Gould\nrespond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies\nand order appropriate adjustments. While a judge exercising discre\ntion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) would not be required to sentence a\nmore culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Con\ngress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discre\ntion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on \u00a73553(a).\nAbbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have an\nticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve dispari\nties by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.\nBut Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when\nit amended \u00a7924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate\ncrime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement. Between 1984 and\n1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of\n\u00a7924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm en\nhancement might suffice to accomplish \u00a7924(c)\u2019s objective. Nor is\nthere any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guide\nlines\u2019 relationship to \u00a7924(c) when it added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause.\nPp. 8\u201314.\n   (c) The Government\u2019s reading\u2014that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause is triggered\nonly when another provision commands a longer term for conduct vio\nlating \u00a7924(c)\u2014makes far more sense. It gives effect to statutory\nlanguage commanding that all \u00a7924(c) offenders shall receive addi\ntional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command re\niterated three times: First, the statute states that the \u00a7924(c)(1) pun\nishment \u201cshall\u201d be imposed \u201cin addition to\u201d the penalty for the\npredicate offense, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A); second, \u00a7924(c) demands a discrete\npunishment even if the predicate crime itself \u201cprovides for an en\nhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous\nweapon or device,\u201d ibid.; third, \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibil\nity that a \u00a7924(c) sentence might \u201crun concurrently with any other\nterm of imprisonment.\u201d Interpreting the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to train on\nconduct offending \u00a7924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.\nThe clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct\n4                     ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u00a7924(c) proscribes. See United States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534\u2013\n    535. There is strong contextual support for the view that the \u201cexcept\u201d\n    clause was intended simply to clarify \u00a7924(c). At the same time Con\n    gress added the clause, it made the rest of \u00a7924(c) more complex, di\n    viding its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and\n    adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.\n    Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges:\n    It added the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\u2019s initial part, which covers greater mini\n    mums provided \u201cby this subsection,\u201d to instruct judges not to stack\n    ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the\n    same weapon. In referencing greater minimums provided by \u201cany\n    other provision of law,\u201d the second portion of the clause simply fur\n    nishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which \u00a7924(c)\n    and a different statute both punish conduct offending \u00a7924(c). Con\n    gress likely anticipated such cases when framing the \u201cexcept\u201d clause,\n    for the bill that reformulated \u00a7924(c)\u2019s text also amended 18 U. S. C.\n    \u00a73559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons con\n    victed of \u201cfirearms possession (as described in \u00a7924(c)).\u201d This inter\n    pretation does not render the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\u2019s second part effectively\n    meaningless. Though \u00a73559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of\n    \u00a7924(c) itself, that the Government places within the \u201cexcept\u201d clause,\n    the \u201cany other provision of law\u201d portion installs a safety valve for ad\n    ditional sentences that Congress may codify outside \u00a7924(c) in the fu\n    ture. Neither United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, nor Republic of\n    Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, warrants a different conclusion.

S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1). The minimum prison term\nfor the offense described in \u00a7924(c) is five years,\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \u201cany other term of impris\nonment imposed on the [offender],\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). The\ntwo consolidated cases before us call for interpretation of\n\u00a7924(c) as that provision was reformulated in 1998.\n  Kevin Abbott and Carlos Rashad Gould, petitioners\nhere, defendants below, were charged with multiple drug\n2                ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand firearm offenses; charges on which they were con\nvicted included violation of \u00a7924(c). Each objected to the\nimposition of any additional prison time for his \u00a7924(c)\nconviction. Their objections rested on the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\nnow prefacing \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Under that clause, a mini\nmum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive\nsentence \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum\nsentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7924(c) itself] or by any\nother provision of law.\u201d\n   Abbott and Gould read \u00a7924(c)\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause to se\ncure them against prison time for their \u00a7924(c) convic\ntions. They claim exemption from punishment under\n\u00a7924(c) because they were sentenced to greater mandatory\nminimum prison terms for convictions on other counts\ncharging different offenses. The \u201cexcept\u201d clause, they\nurge, ensures that \u00a7924(c) offenders will serve at least five\nyears in prison. If conviction on a different count yields a\nmandatory sentence exceeding five years, they maintain,\nthe statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty\nspecified for the \u00a7924(c) violation becomes inoperative.\n   The courts below, agreeing with the Government\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute, read \u00a7924(c)(1) as independ\nently requiring a sentence of at least five years, tacked\nonto any other sentence the defendant receives. The\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause refers to \u201ca greater minimum sentence . . .\notherwise provided.\u201d \u201c[O]therwise provided\u201d for what, the\ncourts below asked; their answer, for conduct offending\n\u00a7924(c), i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a\ncrime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.\n   A defendant is not spared from a separate, consecutive\nsentence for a \u00a7924(c) conviction, the lower courts deter\nmined, whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum\nfor a different count of conviction. Instead, according to\nthe courts below and the Government here, the \u201cexcept\u201d\nclause applies only when another provision\u2014whether\ncontained within or placed outside \u00a7924(c)\u2014commands a\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlonger term for conduct violating \u00a7924(c). For example,\nthe mandatory minimum sentence for a \u00a7924(c) offense is\nfive years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum\nrises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to\nten years. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii). A defendant who\npossessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in viola\ntion of \u00a7924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum\nterm of ten years.\n   We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line\nwith the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defen\ndant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a\n\u00a7924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by\nvirtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a\ndifferent count of conviction. Under the \u201cexcept\u201d clause as\nwe comprehend it, a \u00a7924(c) offender is not subject to\nstacked sentences for violating \u00a7924(c). If he possessed,\nbrandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty\nwould be 10 years, not 22. He is, however, subject to the\nhighest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in\n\u00a7924(c), unless another provision of law directed to con\nduct proscribed by \u00a7924(c) imposes an even greater man\ndatory minimum.\n                             I\n   Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions,\nwere each charged with violating \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i) by pos\nsessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\ncrime. Abbott\u2019s case was tried to a jury in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania, which convicted him on the\n\u00a7924(c) count and three others: two predicate trafficking\ncounts, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841, 846, and being a felon in posses\nsion of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g). Given Abbott\u2019s\nextensive criminal history, his felon-in-possession convic\ntion triggered a 15-year mandatory minimum under the\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e).\nThe District Court sentenced Abbott to the 15 years man\n4                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndated by ACCA, and to an additional five years for the\n\u00a7924(c) violation, yielding a total prison term of 20 years.1\n  Gould\u2019s indictment listed seven separate drug and fire\narm charges. In return for Gould\u2019s agreement to plead\nguilty, the Government dropped all but two: one \u00a7924(c)\noffense and one predicate drug-trafficking crime. The\nlatter, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\ncocaine base, carried a ten-year mandatory minimum\nunder \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Firearm involvement was not an\nelement of that offense. The United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Texas imposed a sentence of\n11 years and 5 months for the trafficking offense and an\nadditional five years for the \u00a7924(c) violation, for a total of\n16 years and 5 months.\n  On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year\nconsecutive sentence each received under \u00a7924(c). Abbott\nurged that ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum triggered\n\u00a7924(c)\u2019s \u201cexcept\u201d clause, because ACCA qualified as\n\u201c[an]other provision of law\u201d that \u201cprovided\u201d a \u201cgreater\nminimum sentence.\u201d Gould said the same of the ten years\ncommanded by his predicate trafficking crime.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Cir\ncuit affirmed Abbott\u2019s sentence, concluding that the \u201cex\ncept\u201d clause \u201crefers only to other minimum sentences that\nmay be imposed for violations of \u00a7924(c).\u201d United States v.\nAbbott, 574 F. 3d 203, 208 (2009). Gould fared no better\nbefore the Fifth Circuit. United States v. Gould, 329 Fed.\nAppx. 569, 570 (2009) (per curiam). That court\u2019s precedent\nalready confined the exception to conduct offending\n\u00a7924(c). United States v. London, 568 F. 3d 553, 564\n(2009). To resolve the division among the Circuits on the\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Abbott received ten years on each drug-trafficking count.     Those\nsentences, imposed concurrently, did not alter his total term of impris\nonment and do not figure in this case.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

In the case of his second or\n    subsequent conviction under this subsection, such\n    person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty\n    years, and if the firearm is a machinegun, or a de\n    structive device, or is equipped with a firearm silencer\n    or firearm muffler, to life imprisonment without re\n    lease. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\n    . . . the term of imprisonment imposed under this sub\n    section [shall not] run concurrently with any other\n    term of imprisonment including that imposed for\n    the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in\n    which the firearm was used or carried.\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)\n    (1994 ed.).\nIf this pre-1998 text governed, all agree, separate counts of\nconviction would have no preemptive force, and Abbott\nand Gould would have been correctly sentenced under\n\u00a7924(c). The question we confront is whether Congress\u2019\n1998 reformulation of \u00a7924(c) rendered the sentences\nimposed on Abbott and Gould excessive.\n   The 1998 alteration responded primarily to our decision\nin Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). In pro\nscribing \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm, Bailey held, \u00a7924(c)(1) did not\nreach \u201cmere possession\u201d of the weapon. Id., at 144. Con\ngress legislated a different result; in the 1998 revision,\n\u201ccolloquially known as the Bailey Fix Act,\u201d the Legislature\nbrought possession within the statute\u2019s compass.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); and it\nelevated the sentences for brandishing and discharging a\nfirearm and for repeat offenses. Congress also restruc\ntured the provision, \u201cdivid[ing] what was once a lengthy\nprincipal sentence into separate subparagraphs.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 7). And it added the prefatory \u201cexcept\u201d\nclause at issue in the cases now before us. As amended,\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A) prescribes:\n       \u201cExcept to the extent that a greater minimum sen\n    tence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by\n    any other provision of law, any person who, during\n    and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traf\n    ficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug\n    trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced pun\n    ishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dan\n    gerous weapon or device) for which the person may be\n    prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or\n    carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n    crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the\n    punishment provided for such crime of violence or\n    drug trafficking crime\u2014\n         \u201c(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n         \u201c(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n         \u201c(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to\n    a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\u201d\n   The 1998 reformulation, furthermore, removed to sepa\nrate paragraphs the provisions commanding higher penal\nties for especially destructive weapons and \u201csecond or\nsubsequent\u201d offenses.

Williams,\n558 F. 3d 166, 171 (CA2 2009).\n   Abbott also tenders an alternative construction: The\nminimum sentence \u201cotherwise provided\u201d must be for a\nfirearm offense\u2014for example, Abbott\u2019s felon-in-possession\ncharge\u2014involving the same firearm that triggered\n\u00a7924(c).4 Conceding that this reading is \u201cnot commanded\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Because   Gould\u2019s only firearm-related offense is his \u00a7924(c) offense,\n10                  ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby the [statute\u2019s] plain language,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 24,\nAbbott asserts that it advances \u00a7924(c)\u2019s goal\u2014to discour\nage bearing arms in furtherance of crime\u2014while avoiding\nthe imposition of \u201ctwo consecutive mandatory minimum\nsentences for the single use of a single firearm,\u201d Abbott\nBrief 47 (emphasis omitted).\n   The three interpretations just described share a com\nmon premise. In adding the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in 1998, all\nthree posit, Congress adopted a less aggressive mode of\napplying \u00a7924(c), one that significantly reduced the sever\nity of the provision\u2019s impact on defendants. Like the\ncourts below, we regard this premise as implausible. As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5\u20136, the pre-1998 version of\n\u00a7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence\u2014punishment to be\nimposed regardless of the sentence received for the predi\ncate crime or any separate firearm conviction. Abbott and\nGould think the \u201cexcept\u201d clause installed, instead, a mod\nest scheme designed simply to ensure that all \u00a7924(c)\noffenders \u201cserve at least 5 years in prison.\u201d Gould Brief 5;\nsee Abbott Brief 10. We doubt that Congress meant a\nprefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \u201cAn Act [t]o throt\ntle criminal use of guns,\u201d to effect a departure so great\nfrom \u00a7924(c)\u2019s longstanding thrust, i.e., its insistence that\nsentencing judges impose additional punishment for\n\u00a7924(c) violations.\n   Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by\nAbbott or Gould, it bears emphasis, we would undercut\nthat same bill\u2019s primary objective: to expand \u00a7924(c)\u2019s\ncoverage to reach firearm possession. In 1999, more than\nhalf of those who violated \u00a7924(c) in connection with a\ndrug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of\nten years or more for that trafficking offense. Letter from\nGlenn R. Schmitt, United States Sentencing Commission,\nto Supreme Court Library (Nov. 10, 2010) (available in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nGould\u2019s sentence would stand under Abbott\u2019s alternative construction. \n\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Congress, however, imposed\nonly a five-year minimum for firearm possession \u201cin fur\ntherance of\u201d a drug offense. As construed by Abbott and\nGould, the amendment to include firearm possession as a\n\u00a7924(c) offense would spare the most serious drug offend\ners from any discrete punishment for the very firearm\nactivity the amendment targeted. \u201cWe are disinclined to\nsay that what Congress imposed with one hand . . . it\nwithdrew with the other . . . .\u201d Logan v. United States, 552\nU. S. 23, 35 (2007).\n   Abbott\u2019s and Gould\u2019s proposed readings, moreover,\nwould result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did\nnot intend. We note first that \u00a7924(c), as they construe it,\nwould often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that\nprovision makes independently criminal. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n52. For example, an individual who sold enough drugs to\nreceive a ten-year minimum sentence under \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\ncould, so far as \u00a7924(c) is concerned, possess or even bran\ndish a gun without incurring any additional punishment.\n   Stranger still, under the Abbott and Gould readings, the\nworst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences.\nConsider two defendants convicted of trafficking in co\ncaine. The first possesses 500 grams and is subject to a\nmandatory minimum of five years, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B); the\nsecond possesses five kilograms and is subject to a manda\ntory minimum of ten years, \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). Both brandish\nfirearms, calling for a sentence of seven years under\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(ii). The first defendant, under all readings,\nwill spend at least 12 years in prison. The second defen\ndant\u2019s ten-year drug minimum, according to Abbott and\nGould, triggers the \u201cexcept\u201d clause and wipes out that\ndefendant\u2019s \u00a7924(c) penalty; though the more culpable of\nthe two, the second defendant\u2019s minimum term would be\njust ten years. Brief for United States 40. Like the Third\nCircuit below, \u201c[w]e are confident that Congress did not\nintend such a bizarre result.\u201d 574 F. 3d, at 209.\n12                  ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Abbott\u2019s alternative construction, which homes in on\nother firearm offenses, gives rise to similar oddities. On\nthis reading, Abbott\u2019s 15-year ACCA sentence for being a\nfelon-in-possession would preempt his five-year \u00a7924(c)\nsentence, and his minimum term would be 15 years,\nrather than 20.5 But if ACCA were not at issue, Abbott\u2019s\nminimum term would be the same 15 years: his five-\nyear \u00a7924(c) sentence on top of his ten-year drug sen\ntence. Qualification as a career criminal would carry no\nconsequence.\n   Nor does Abbott\u2019s second construction necessarily pro\nmote more equitable outcomes. Suppose, for example, that\na career criminal sold drugs together with a first-time\noffender, and both brandished firearms in the process.\nThe first-time offender, lacking a felon-in-possession\nconviction, would serve a seven-year \u00a7924(c) sentence on\ntop of a ten-year drug sentence, for a total of 17 years. But\nthe career criminal\u2019s ACCA sentence would preempt the\n\u00a7924(c) sentence; he would serve only 15 years.\n   Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may\ntake account of such anomalies and order appropriate\nadjustments. We observe first that no correction or avoid\nance appears possible for the anomaly that, while \u00a7924(c)\n\u201cdefines a standalone crime,\u201d a \u00a7924(c) sentence would be\nwiped out by a wholly separate and independent convic\ntion. United States v. Easter, 553 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA7\n2009) (per curiam) (\u201cA determination of guilt that yields\nno sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.\u201d). We\ndo, however, agree that a judge exercising discretion un\nder 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) \u201cwould [not] be required to sen\ntence\u201d a more culpable defendant to a lesser term; the\njudge could increase that defendant\u2019s sentence for a predi\ncate crime to make up for \u00a7924(c)\u2019s failure to effect any\nenlargement of the time served. United States v. Whitley,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 ACCA   sentences may run concurrently with drug sentences.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n529 F. 3d 150, 155 (CA2 2008). But we doubt Congress\nhad such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before we\nheld, in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), that\ndistrict courts have discretion to depart from the Sentenc\ning Guidelines on the basis of \u00a73553(a).\n   Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress\ncould have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guide\nlines would resolve disparities. See Abbott Brief 32\u201335;\nGould Brief 30\u201332. On this view, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause\nensures that a \u00a7924(c) offender incurs a minimum sen\ntence of considerable length; the Guidelines would then\ncontrol, elevating that sentence based on firearm posses\nsion or use. See United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1998)\n(increasing offense level for defendants who use or possess\nfirearms in course of violent crime or drug trafficking);\n\u00a7\u00a72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov. 2009) (same).\n   We do not gainsay that Abbott and Gould project a\nrational, less harsh, mode of sentencing. But we do not\nthink it was the mode Congress ordered. Congress ex\npressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it\namended \u00a7924(c) in the same law that created the Sen\ntencing Commission and the Guidelines. Pub. L. 98\u2013473,\n98 Stat. 1987, 2138. Four years earlier, in Busic v. United\nStates, 446 U. S. 398, 404 (1980), we had read \u00a7924(c) to\nimpose no penalty when the predicate crime itself pre\nscribed a firearm enhancement; similarly, Abbott and\nGould now read \u00a7924(c) to impose no penalty when the\nGuidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predi\ncate sentence. The 1984 legislation \u201crepudiated\u201d Busic,\nclarifying that \u00a7924(c) applied even when the predicate\ncrime already \u201cprovides for an enhanced punishment if\ncommitted by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or\ndevice.\u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 10 (1997)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach\n14                   ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nor increased the severity of \u00a7924(c) on four occasions,\nnever suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement\nmight suffice to accomplish \u00a7924(c)\u2019s objective.6 Nor is\nthere the slightest indication that Congress was contem\nplating the Guidelines\u2019 relationship to \u00a7924(c) when it\nadded the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in the 1998 amendments.7\n   The \u201cexcept\u201d clause, we note, would have been a most\nhaphazard way to achieve a Guidelines-driven rollback of\n\u00a7924(c). If Congress wanted to ensure that \u00a7924(c) offend\ners \u201creceive at least five years in prison,\u201d and to rely on\nthe Guidelines for the rest, Abbott Brief 10, there was an\nobvious solution: Congress could have excised all prescrip\ntions ordering that \u00a7924(c) sentences shall run consecu\ntively to other sentences. Without such a requirement, all\ndefendants would benefit from a minimum-plus-\nGuidelines regime\u2014not just the most culpable offenders.\nCongress did not adopt that obvious solution, we think,\nbecause it did not want the Guidelines to supplant \u00a7924(c).\n                           C\n  The Government\u2019s reading of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, we are\nconvinced, makes far more sense than the interpretations\nurged by Abbott and Gould.

See Hearing on S.\n191 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st\nSess., 38 (1997) (statement of Thomas G. Hungar) (\u201c[B]y adding an\nintroductory clause authorizing imposition of stiffer minimum sen\ntences if required under other provisions of law, S. 191 eliminates any\npotential inconsistency with other statutes.\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7924(c) violation \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater\nminimum sentence is otherwise provided . . . by any other\nprovision of law,\u201d Congress meant:\n    \u201c[I]f another provision of the United States Code\n    mandates a punishment for using, carrying, or pos\n    sessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking\n    crime or crime of violence, and that minimum sen\n    tence is longer than the punishment applicable under\n    \u00a7924(c), then the longer sentence applies.\u201d Brief for\n    United States 17.\n   This reading gives effect to the statutory language\ncommanding that all \u00a7924(c) offenders shall receive addi\ntional punishment for their violation of that provision, a\ncommand reiterated three times. First, the statute states\nthat the punishment specified in \u00a7924(c)(1) \u201cshall\u201d be\nimposed \u201cin addition to\u201d the penalty for the predicate\noffense. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Second, after Busic, \u00a7924(c) de\nmands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime\nitself \u201cprovides for an enhanced punishment if committed\nby the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.\u201d\nIbid. Third, \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that\na \u00a7924(c) sentence might \u201crun concurrently with any other\nterm of imprisonment.\u201d We doubt that Congress, having\nretained this thrice-repeated instruction, would simulta\nneously provide an exception severely limiting application\nof the instruction.      Cf. Greenlaw v. United States,\n554 U. S. 237, 251 (2008) (\u201cWe resist attributing to Con\ngress an intention to render a statute so internally\ninconsistent.\u201d).\n   Interpreting the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to train on conduct\noffending \u00a7924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.\nThe \u201cexcept\u201d clause is not a standalone enactment, or even\na standalone sentence. Rather, it precedes and qualifies\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)\u2019s principal clause, which punishes the pos\nsession of a firearm in connection with specified predicate\n16               ABBOTT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrimes. The \u201cgrammatical and logical scope\u201d of a proviso,\nwe have held, \u201cis confined to the subject-matter of the\nprincipal clause\u201d to which it is attached. United States v.\nMorrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534\u2013535 (1925). As a proviso\nattached to \u00a7924(c), the \u201cexcept\u201d clause is most naturally\nread to refer to the conduct \u00a7924(c) proscribes. Accord\nUnited States v. Villa, 589 F. 3d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009).\n   There is strong contextual support for our view that\nCongress intended the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to serve simply as a\nclarification of \u00a7924(c), not as a major restraint on the\nstatute\u2019s operation. At the same time Congress added the\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause, it made the rest of \u00a7924(c) more complex.\nThe 1998 revision divided the statute\u2019s existing sentencing\nprescriptions into four paragraphs in lieu of one, and\nadded new penalties for brandishing and discharging a\nfirearm. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)\u2013(D). We know that Congress\nthought the restructuring might confuse sentencing\njudges: Warding off confusion, all agree, was the Legisla\nture\u2019s sole objective in adding the initial part of the \u201cex\ncept\u201d clause, which covers greater minimums provided \u201cby\nthis subsection.\u201d That portion of the clause instructs\njudges to pick the single highest sentence stipulated for a\n\u00a7924(c) violation within \u00a7924(c) itself, and not to stack ten\nyears for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing\nthe same weapon, whenever a defendant does both.\n   In referencing greater minimums provided by \u201cany other\nprovision of law,\u201d we think, the second portion of the\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking\ninstruction for cases in which \u00a7924(c) and a different\nstatute both punish conduct offending \u00a7924(c). Congress\nlikely anticipated such cases when the \u201cexcept\u201d clause was\nframed in 1998, for the bill that reformulated the text of\n\u00a7924(c) did just one thing more: It amended 18 U. S.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\u201335, 42\u201344.8 But \u00a73559(c)\nalready imposes a life sentence.

S. 10, 17 (1994), we are persuaded that none remains here: The\n\u201cexcept\u201d clause covers only conduct offending \u00a7924(c). Although the\nclause might have been more meticulously drafted, the \u201cgrammatical\npossibility\u201d of a defendant\u2019s interpretation does not command a resort\nto the rule of lenity if the interpretation proffered by the defendant\nreflects \u201can implausible reading of the congressional purpose.\u201d Caron v.\nUnited States, 524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998).\n</pre>",
