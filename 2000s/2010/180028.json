CALIFORNIA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME\n\n                 COURT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n               No. 10\u20135196. Decided November 29, 2010 \n\n\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n    Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join,\nrespecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.\n    After a jury convicted Richard Gamache of first-degree\nmurder and sentenced him to death, Gamache\u2019s counsel\nand the trial court learned that during deliberations, court\npersonnel inadvertently gave the jury a videotape that had\nnot been admitted into evidence. During its deliberations,\nthe jury watched the video twice in full and a third time in\npart before reaching its verdict. The video showed a police\ninterview of Gamache and his codefendants on the day of\nthe murder in which Gamache confessed to the crime in\ngraphic terms. The video showed Gamache explaining, for\nexample, that given the opportunity, he would have shot\npolice officers. 48 Cal. 4th 347, 402, 227 P. 3d 342, 390\n(2010) (quoting Gamache on the video as stating, \u201c \u2018 If I\nfigured, if I had any idea I was about to be arrested, I\u2019d\nhave started shooting. . . . See, I figure if I\u2019m going to die,\n. . . I\u2019m going to take one or two with me\u2019 \u201d).\n    On appeal, the California Supreme Court held that the\njury\u2019s access to the tape was indisputably error, citing our\nopinion in Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965). 48\nCal. 4th, at 396, 227 P. 3d, at 386 (\u201c \u2018 The requirement that\na jury\u2019s verdict \u201cmust be based upon the evidence devel\n2                 GAMACHE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\noped at the trial\u201d goes to the fundamental integrity of all\nthat is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by\njury\u2019 \u201d (quoting Turner, 379 U. S., at 472)); see also id., at\n472\u2013473 (\u201cIn the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a\ncriminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the\n\u2018evidence developed\u2019 against a defendant shall come from\nthe witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full\njudicial protection of the defendant\u2019s right of confronta\ntion, of cross-examination, and of counsel\u201d). The Califor\nnia Supreme Court found that the error was trial error\nand not the result of any juror misconduct. Accordingly,\nit did not apply a presumption of prejudice, 48 Cal. 4th,\nat 399, 227 P. 3d, at 388, and proceeded to conduct a\nharmless-error analysis.\n   Under our decision in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S.\n18, 24 (1967), the prosecution must carry the burden of\nshowing that a constitutional trial error is harmless be\nyond a reasonable doubt. See also Deck v. Missouri, 544\nU. S. 622, 635 (2005) (\u201c[W]here a court, without adequate\njustification, orders the defendant to wear shackles that\nwill be seen by the jury . . . [t]he State must prove \u2018beyond\na reasonable doubt that the [shackling] error complained\nof did not contribute to the verdict obtained\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nChapman, 386 U. S., at 24)); United States v. Dominguez\nBenitez, 542 U. S. 74, 81, n. 7 (2004) (\u201cWhen the Govern\nment has the burden of addressing prejudice, as in excus\ning preserved error as harmless on direct review of the\ncriminal conviction, it is not enough to negate an effect on\nthe outcome of the case\u201d (citing Chapman, 386 U. S., at\n24)); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 295\u2013296 (1991)\n(\u201cThe Court has the power to review the record de novo in\norder to determine an error\u2019s harmlessness. In so doing, it\nmust be determined whether the State has met its burden\nof demonstrating that the\u201d error \u201cdid not contribute to\n[defendant\u2019s] conviction\u201d (citations omitted)).\n   The California Supreme Court, however, stated, \u201c[I]n\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

It is not clear what the\ncourt intended in allocating the burden to the defendant to\ndemonstrate prejudice, but if it meant to convey that the\ndefendant bore the burden of persuasion, that would\ncontravene Chapman. See 386 U. S., at 24 (noting that\nthe \u201coriginal common-law harmless-error rule put the\nburden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that\nthere was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his errone\nously obtained judgment\u201d); cf. O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513\nU. S. 432, 438\u2013439 (1995) (describing Chapman as \u201cplac\ning the risk of doubt\u201d about harmlessness on the State).\n   However, it appears from the court\u2019s recitation of the\nevidence and its analysis that the court found that the\nerror at issue was harmless, regardless of the burden\nallocation. See 48 Cal. 4th, at 399, 227 P. 3d, at 388\n(\u201c[T]here is no reasonable possibility the outcome would\nhave been different absent the error\u201d). I therefore do not\ndisagree with the denial of certiorari.\n   I nonetheless write respecting the denial of certiorari\nbecause the allocation of the burden of proving harmless\nness can be outcome determinative in some cases. See\nFulminante, 499 U. S., at 296 (\u201cFive of us are of the view\nthat the State has not carried its burden and accordingly\naffirm the judgment of the court below reversing respon\ndent\u2019s conviction\u201d); see, e.g., State v. Ball, 2004 SD 9, 675\nN. W. 2d 192 (holding that the State had not met its bur\nden of showing that prosecutor\u2019s improper references in\nclosing argument to defendant\u2019s silence were harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt); State v. Jorgensen, 2008 WI\n60, 310 Wis. 2d 138, 754 N. W. 2d 77 (holding that the\nState had not met its burden of showing that Confronta\ntion Clause violation was harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt). With all that is at stake in capital cases, cf. Kyles\n4                GAMACHE v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nv. Whitley, 514 U.
