MAVERICK RECORDING \n\n               COMPANY ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 10\u201394. Decided November 29, 2010 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   I would grant the petition to consider the question\nwhether 17 U. S. C. \u00a7402(d) applies when a person is\nfound to have engaged in copyright infringement by down\nloading digital music files. Under \u00a7504(c)(1), an infringer\nis ordinarily liable for statutory damages of \u201cnot less than\n$750 or more than $30,000\u201d per work infringed. In a case\ninvolving an \u201cinnocent infringer,\u201d however, the minimum\nstatutory damages that must be awarded are reduced.\nSpecifically, if the infringer proves that he or she \u201cwas not\naware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts\nconstituted an infringement,\u201d then the minimum statutory\ndamages per violation are $200. \u00a7504(c)(2).\n   In this case, a 16-year-old was found to have infringed\nrespondents\u2019 copyrights by downloading digital music files.\nThe District Court held that there were genuine issues of\nfact on whether she qualified as an innocent infringer, but\nthe Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that another\nprovision, \u00a7402(d) foreclosed the innocent-infringer de\nfense as a matter of law. Section 402(d) provides, with an\nexception not relevant here, that if a prescribed notice of\ncopyright \u201cappears on the published phonorecord or\nphonorecords to which a defendant . . . had access, then no\nweight shall be given to . . . a defendant\u2019s interposition of a\ndefense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of\nactual or statutory damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

See Berne\nConvention Implementation Act, \u00a77, 102 Stat. 2857. The\ntheory of \u00a7402(d) appears to be that a person who copies\nmusic from a material object bearing the prescribed copy\nright notice is deemed to have \u201creason to believe that his\nor her acts constituted an infringement,\u201d \u00a7504(c)(2). But a\nperson who downloads a digital music file generally does\nnot see any material object bearing a copyright notice, and\naccordingly there is force to the argument that \u00a7402(d)\ndoes not apply. In such a case, the question would simply\nbe whether the infringer \u201cwas . . . aware and had . . .\nreason to believe,\u201d \u00a7504(c)(2), that the downloading was\nillegal.\n   The Court of Appeals in the present case adopted a very\ndifferent interpretation of \u00a7402(d). The court held that the\ninnocent infringer defense was \u201cforeclose[d] . . . as a mat\nter of law\u201d because (1) respondents \u201cprovided proper notice\non each of the published phonorecords from which the\naudio files were taken\u201d before they were made available on\na file-sharing network and (2) petitioner relied solely on\n\u00a7504(c)(2) and did not dispute her \u201caccess\u201d to the phonore\ncords under \u00a7402(d). 598 F. 3d 193, 198\u2013199 (CA5 2010).\nUnder this interpretation, it is not necessary that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Specifically,\n                 17 U.

In any event, the Court of\nAppeals rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that her youth and\nlack of legal sophistication were relevant considerations\u2014\na conclusion that would not necessarily be correct if the\ndeterminative question were simply whether petitioner\nhad \u201creason to believe\u201d that her actions were illegal.\nAlthough \u201creason to believe\u201d is an objective standard, it is\nby no means clear that certain objective characteristics of\nthe infringer\u2014such as age\u2014may not be taken into ac\ncount.\n  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision may or may not set out a\nsensible rule for the post-\u201cphonorecord\u201d age, but it is at\nleast questionable whether the decision correctly inter\nprets \u00a7402(d). Although there are now no conflicting\nCircuit decisions, I would grant review in this case be\ncause not many cases presenting this issue are likely to\nreach the Courts of Appeals. The Court has decided not to\ngrant review at this time, but if a conflict in the Circuits\ndevelops in the future, the question presented, in my\njudgment, is important enough to warrant review.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In BMG Music v.
