Argued October 5, 2010\u2014Decided November 30, 2010\nThe Humphries (hereinafter respondents) were accused of child abuse\n  in California, but were later exonerated. However, under California\n  law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index),\n  where they would remain available to various state agencies for at\n  least 10 years. The statute has no procedures for allowing individu\n  als to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California\n  nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures. Respondents\n  filed suit under \u00a71983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a decla\n  ration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had de\n  prived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a\n  mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.\n  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but\n  the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment\n  required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hear\n  ing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief. The\n  court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to\n  attorney\u2019s fees, including $60,000 from the county. The county ob\n  jected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its\n  \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d caused the deprivation of a plaintiff\u2019s federal right,\n  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694;\n  but a state policy caused any deprivation here. The Ninth Circuit, in\n  ter alia, found that respondents did prevail against the county on\n  their claim for declaratory relief because Monell did not apply to pro\n  spective relief claims.\nHeld: Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies in \u00a71983 cases\n irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.\n Pp. 4\u201310.\n2               LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court based its holding\n    that municipal entities were not \u201cperson[s]\u201d under \u00a71983 on the pro\n    vision\u2019s legislative history, particularly Congress\u2019 rejection of the so\n    called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities\n    liable for damages done by private persons \u201c \u2018riotously and tumultu\n    ously assembled,\u2019 \u201d id., at 188\u2013190, and n. 38. Reexamining this leg\n    islative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe. It concluded\n    that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it\n    would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would\n    have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others. The\n    Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,\n    went on to explain what acts are the municipality\u2019s own for purposes\n    of liability. The Court held that \u201ca municipality cannot be held li\n    able\u201d solely for the acts of others, e.g., \u201csolely because it employs a\n    tortfeasor,\u201d 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable \u201cwhen execu\n    tion of a government\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,\u201d id., at\n    694. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Section 1983, read in light of Monell\u2019s understanding of the leg\n    islative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims\n    for money damages, fall within the scope of the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d re\n    quirement. Nothing in \u00a71983 suggests that the causation require\n    ment should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text\n    suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets\n    \u00a71983\u2019s elements \u201cshall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in eq\n    uity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Thus, as Monell explic\n    itly stated, \u201clocal governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under\n    \u00a71983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here,\n    the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or exe\n    cutes\u201d a policy or custom. 436 U. S., at 690. To find the \u201cpolicy or\n    custom\u201d requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would\n    also undermine Monell\u2019s logic. For whether an action or omission is a\n    municipality\u2019s \u201cown\u201d has to do with the nature of the action or omis\n    sion, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n    Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (c) Respondents\u2019 arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.\n    Pp. 8\u20139.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other\nMembers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera\ntion or decision of the case.\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

CRAIG ARTHUR HUMPHRIES ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [November 30, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658 (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs\nsuing a municipal entity under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 must\nshow that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or\ncustom. The case before the Court in Monell directly\ninvolved monetary damages. The question presented is\nwhether the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement also applies\nwhen plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunc\ntion or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does\nso apply.\n                            I\n  The case arises out of the following circumstances: The\nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a711164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010),\nrequires law enforcement and other state agencies to\ninvestigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies\nmust report to the California Department of Justice all\ninstances of reported child abuse the agency finds \u201cnot\nunfounded,\u201d even if they are \u201cinconclusive or unsubstanti\nated.\u201d \u00a7\u00a711169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the\n2           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartment to include all these reports in a Child Abuse\nCentral Index (Index), where they remain available to\nvarious state agencies for at least 10 years. \u00a711170(a).\nThe statute also says that if\n    \u201ca report has previously been filed which subse\n    quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of\n    Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and\n    shall not retain the report.\u201d \u00a711169(a).\nThe statute, however, does not set forth procedures for\nreviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,\nor for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in\nthe Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had\nCalifornia or Los Angeles County created any such proce\ndures. But cf. \u00a711170(a)(2) (\u201cThe submitting agencies are\nresponsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention\nof the reports described in this section\u201d).\n   The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of\nchild abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought\nto have their names removed from the Index. Unable to\nconvince the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department to remove\nthem, they filed this \u00a71983 case against the attorney\ngeneral of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two\ndetectives in the sheriff\u2019s department, and the County of\nLos Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a\ndeclaration that the defendants had deprived them of their\nconstitutional rights by failing to create a procedural\nmechanism through which one could contest inclusion on\nthe Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. The District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California granted summary judgment to all of\nthe defendants on the ground that California had not\ndeprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected \u201cliberty\u201d\ninterest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequired the State to provide those included on the list\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice and \u201c \u2018some kind of hearing.\u2019 \u201d 554 F. 3d 1170, 1201\n(2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were\nentitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on\nremand) they might prove damages as well. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately\n$600,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (provid\ning for payment of attorney\u2019s fees to parties prevailing on\n\u00a71983 claims). See No. 05\u201356467 (June 22, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 1\u20134 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05\u2013\n56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition\n1\u20132 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit\nwrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately\n$60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee\nOrder 2.\n   Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and there\nfore that it could be held responsible for attorney\u2019s fees. It\nargued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were\nnot prevailing parties. That is because the county is a\nmunicipal entity. Under Monell\u2019s holding a municipal\nentity is liable under \u00a71983 only if a municipal \u201cpolicy or\ncustom\u201d caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.\n436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). And it was state\npolicy, not county policy, that brought about any depriva\ntion here.\n   The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as fol\nlows: First, it said that county policy might be responsible\nfor the deprivation. It \u201cis possible,\u201d the Ninth Circuit said,\nthat the county, \u201c[b]y failing to\u201d \u201ccreat[e] an independent\nprocedure that would allow\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cto challenge\ntheir listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that vio\nlated\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconstitutional rights.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at\n1202. Second, it said that \u201cbecause this issue is not clear\nbased on the record before us on appeal . . . we remand to\nthe district court to determine the County\u2019s liability under\nMonell.\u201d Ibid. Third, it saw no reason to remand in re\n4            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nspect to the county\u2019s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor\nney\u2019s fees. That, it wrote, is because \u201cin our circuit . . . the\nlimitations to liability established in Monell do not apply\nto claims for prospective relief,\u201d such as the declaratory\njudgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee\nOrder 3\u20134 (citing Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250\n(CA9 1989); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644\n(CA9 2008); emphasis added).\n   The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned\nNinth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell\u2019s\n\u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies only to claims for\ndamages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because\nthe Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we\ngranted the county\u2019s petition for certiorari. Compare\nReynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (hold\ning that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies to\nclaims for prospective relief as well as claims for dam\nages); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F. 3d 65, 71\n(CA1 2002) (same); Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters\nAssn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 967, n. 6\n(CA4 1995) (applying the Monell requirement to a prospec\ntive relief claim); Church v. Huntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332,\n1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with Chaloux, supra, at 251\n(holding that Monell does not apply to prospective relief\nclaims). See also Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School\nDist. No. 1, 274 F. 3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the\nquestion but noting the \u201cpredominant\u201d view that \u201cMonell\u2019s\nholding applies regardless of the nature of the relief\nsought\u201d).\n   We conclude that Monell\u2019s holding applies to \u00a71983\nclaims against municipalities for prospective relief as well\nas to claims for damages.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n    We begin with \u00a71983 itself, which provides: \n\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n      \u201cEvery person who, under color of any [state] stat\n    ute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . sub\n    jects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other per\n    son . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by\n    the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall\n    be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit\n    in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d\n    (Emphasis added.)\nIn 1961, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held\nthat municipal entities were not \u201cperson[s]\u201d under \u00a71983.\nThe Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil\nRights Act of 1871\u2019s enactment. It noted that Congress\nrejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)\nthat would have made municipalities liable for damage\ndone by private persons \u201c \u2018riotously and tumultuously\nassembled.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 188\u2013190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,\nthe Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871\nHouse of Representatives that \u201c \u2018Congress had no constitu\ntional power to impose any obligation upon county and\ntown organizations, the mere instrumentality for the\nadministration of state law.\u2019 \u201d 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting\nCong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);\nemphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress\nmust have doubted its \u201cconstitutional power . . . to impose\ncivil liability on municipalities.\u201d 365 U. S., at 190. And\nfor that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude\nmunicipal corporations as \u00a71983 defendants. The statute\u2019s\nkey term \u201cperson\u201d therefore did not cover municipal enti\nties. Id., at 191.\n  Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered\nthe question of municipal liability. After reexamining the\n1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that\nCongress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not\nbecause it would have imposed liability upon municipali\n6           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nties, but because it would have imposed liability upon\nmunicipalities based purely upon the acts of others. That\nis to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed\nliability upon local governments \u201cwithout regard to\nwhether a local government was in any way at fault for\nthe breach of the peace for which it was to be held for\ndamages.\u201d 436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added). In\nMonell\u2019s view Congress may have thought that it lacked\nthe power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon\nmunicipalities, id., at 679, but \u201cnothing said in debate on\nthe Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a\nmunicipality liable . . . for its own violations of the Four\nteenth Amendment,\u201d id., at 683 (emphasis added). The\nCourt, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were\n\u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a71983. 436 U. S., at 690.\n  The Court also concluded that a municipality could not\nbe held liable under \u00a71983 solely because it employed a\ntortfeasor. The Court\u2019s conclusion rested on \u201cthe language\nof \u00a71983, read against the background of the same legisla\ntive history.\u201d Id., at 691. Section 1983\u2019s causation lan\nguage imposes liability on a \u201c \u2018person who . . . shall subject,\nor cause to be subjected, any person\u2019 \u201d to a deprivation of\nfederal rights. Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis de\nleted). That language, the Court observed, could not \u201cbe\neasily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the\nbasis of the existence of an employer-employee relation\nship with a tortfeasor.\u201d 436 U. S., at 692. The statute\u2019s\nlegislative history, in particular the constitutional objec\ntions that had been raised to the Sherman amendment,\nsupported this conclusion. Id., at 692\u201394, and n. 57.\n   For these reasons, the Court concluded that a munici\npality could be held liable under \u00a71983 only for its own\nviolations of federal law. Id., at 694.

See\nibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action\nleads us here to use a shorthand term \u201cpolicy or custom,\u201d\nbut when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See\nid., at 694 (using the shorthand \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d); see\nalso, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555\nU. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase\n\u201ccustom, policy, or practice,\u201d to describe municipal liability\nunder \u00a71983).\n   In sum, in Monell the Court held that \u201ca municipality\ncannot be held liable\u201d solely for the acts of others, e.g.,\n\u201csolely because it employs a tortfeasor.\u201d 436 U. S., at 691.\nBut the municipality may be held liable \u201cwhen execution\nof a government\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.\u201d\nId., at 694 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  The language of \u00a71983 read in light of Monell\u2019s under\nstanding of the legislative history explains why claims for\nprospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall\nwithin the scope of the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement.\nNothing in the text of \u00a71983 suggests that the causation\nrequirement contained in the statute should change with\nthe form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the\nopposite when it provides that a person who meets \u00a71983\u2019s\n8           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nelements \u201cshall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Thus, as\nMonell explicitly stated, \u201c[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can\nbe sued directly under \u00a71983 for monetary, declaratory, or\ninjunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged\nto be unconstitutional implements or executes\u201d a policy or\ncustom. 436 U. S., at 690 (emphasis added). Monell went\non to quote this Court\u2019s statement in a 1973 case, Kenosha\nv. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 513, to the effect that the Con\ngress that enacted \u00a71983 did not intend the \u201c \u2018generic word\n\u201cperson\u201d . . . to have a bifurcated application to municipal\ncorporations depending on the nature of the relief sought\nagainst them.\u2019 \u201d 436 U. S., at 701, n. 66 (emphasis added).\nMonell added that \u201c[n]othing we say today affects\u201d this\npre-Monell \u201cconclusion.\u201d Ibid.\n   Monell\u2019s logic also argues against any such relief-based\nbifurcation. The Monell Court thought that Congress\nintended potential \u00a71983 liability where a municipality\u2019s\nown violations were at issue but not where only the viola\ntions of others were at issue. The \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d re\nquirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in\nlaw. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospec\ntive relief is at issue would undermine Monell\u2019s logic. For\nwhether an action or omission is a municipality\u2019s \u201cown\u201d\nhas to do with the nature of the action or omission, not\nwith the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n                               C\n  The Humphries\u2019 (hereinafter respondents) arguments to\nthe contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note\nthat by the time Monell reached the Supreme Court only\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 damages claim remained live. See id., at\n661. From this fact they conclude that the Court\u2019s holding\napplies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A\nholding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the\nspecific facts of the particular case. It does so here.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a\ndamages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that\nmunicipalities might have to pay large damages awards.\nThe Court so suggests when it points out that municipali\nties should not be liable for an employee\u2019s wrongful acts,\nsimply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat\nsuperior. But as we have pointed out, the Court\u2019s rejection\nof respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the\nmunicipality\u2019s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil\nity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality\u2019s\nown wrongful conduct.\n   Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief\nis at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court\ncannot grant prospective relief against a municipality\nunless the municipality\u2019s own conduct has caused the\nviolation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,\nthe Monell requirement \u201cshouldn\u2019t screen out any case.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,\nhowever, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces\nsary. If respondents are right, our holding may have\nlimited practical significance. But that possibility does not\nprovide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by\nadopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal\nliability that the Court has previously rejected.\n   Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument\nthat applying Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief\nclaims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional viola\ntions beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits\napply Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief, however,\nrespondents have not presented us with any actual or\nhypothetical example that provides serious cause for\nconcern.\n                      *    *     *\n  For these reasons, we hold that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or cus\n10         LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntom\u201d requirement applies in \u00a71983 cases irrespective of\nwhether the relief sought is monetary or prospective. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s contrary judgment is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n",

The statute has no procedures for allowing individu\n  als to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California\n  nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures. Respondents\n  filed suit under \u00a71983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a decla\n  ration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had de\n  prived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a\n  mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.\n  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but\n  the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment\n  required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hear\n  ing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.

S. 167, this Court based its holding\n    that municipal entities were not \u201cperson[s]\u201d under \u00a71983 on the pro\n    vision\u2019s legislative history, particularly Congress\u2019 rejection of the so\n    called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities\n    liable for damages done by private persons \u201c \u2018riotously and tumultu\n    ously assembled,\u2019 \u201d id., at 188\u2013190, and n. 38. Reexamining this leg\n    islative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe. It concluded\n    that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it\n    would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would\n    have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others. The\n    Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,\n    went on to explain what acts are the municipality\u2019s own for purposes\n    of liability. The Court held that \u201ca municipality cannot be held li\n    able\u201d solely for the acts of others, e.g., \u201csolely because it employs a\n    tortfeasor,\u201d 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable \u201cwhen execu\n    tion of a government\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,\u201d id., at\n    694. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Section 1983, read in light of Monell\u2019s understanding of the leg\n    islative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims\n    for money damages, fall within the scope of the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d re\n    quirement. Nothing in \u00a71983 suggests that the causation require\n    ment should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text\n    suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets\n    \u00a71983\u2019s elements \u201cshall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in eq\n    uity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Thus, as Monell explic\n    itly stated, \u201clocal governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under\n    \u00a71983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here,\n    the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or exe\n    cutes\u201d a policy or custom. 436 U. S., at 690. To find the \u201cpolicy or\n    custom\u201d requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would\n    also undermine Monell\u2019s logic.

CRAIG ARTHUR HUMPHRIES ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [November 30, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658 (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs\nsuing a municipal entity under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 must\nshow that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or\ncustom. The case before the Court in Monell directly\ninvolved monetary damages. The question presented is\nwhether the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement also applies\nwhen plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunc\ntion or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does\nso apply.\n                            I\n  The case arises out of the following circumstances: The\nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a711164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010),\nrequires law enforcement and other state agencies to\ninvestigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies\nmust report to the California Department of Justice all\ninstances of reported child abuse the agency finds \u201cnot\nunfounded,\u201d even if they are \u201cinconclusive or unsubstanti\nated.\u201d \u00a7\u00a711169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the\n2           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartment to include all these reports in a Child Abuse\nCentral Index (Index), where they remain available to\nvarious state agencies for at least 10 years. \u00a711170(a).\nThe statute also says that if\n    \u201ca report has previously been filed which subse\n    quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of\n    Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and\n    shall not retain the report.\u201d \u00a711169(a).\nThe statute, however, does not set forth procedures for\nreviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,\nor for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in\nthe Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had\nCalifornia or Los Angeles County created any such proce\ndures. But cf. \u00a711170(a)(2) (\u201cThe submitting agencies are\nresponsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention\nof the reports described in this section\u201d).\n   The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of\nchild abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought\nto have their names removed from the Index. Unable to\nconvince the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department to remove\nthem, they filed this \u00a71983 case against the attorney\ngeneral of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two\ndetectives in the sheriff\u2019s department, and the County of\nLos Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a\ndeclaration that the defendants had deprived them of their\nconstitutional rights by failing to create a procedural\nmechanism through which one could contest inclusion on\nthe Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. The District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California granted summary judgment to all of\nthe defendants on the ground that California had not\ndeprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected \u201cliberty\u201d\ninterest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequired the State to provide those included on the list\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice and \u201c \u2018some kind of hearing.\u2019 \u201d 554 F. 3d 1170, 1201\n(2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were\nentitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on\nremand) they might prove damages as well. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately\n$600,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (provid\ning for payment of attorney\u2019s fees to parties prevailing on\n\u00a71983 claims). See No. 05\u201356467 (June 22, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 1\u20134 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05\u2013\n56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition\n1\u20132 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit\nwrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately\n$60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee\nOrder 2.\n   Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and there\nfore that it could be held responsible for attorney\u2019s fees. It\nargued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were\nnot prevailing parties. That is because the county is a\nmunicipal entity. Under Monell\u2019s holding a municipal\nentity is liable under \u00a71983 only if a municipal \u201cpolicy or\ncustom\u201d caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.\n436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). And it was state\npolicy, not county policy, that brought about any depriva\ntion here.\n   The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as fol\nlows: First, it said that county policy might be responsible\nfor the deprivation. It \u201cis possible,\u201d the Ninth Circuit said,\nthat the county, \u201c[b]y failing to\u201d \u201ccreat[e] an independent\nprocedure that would allow\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cto challenge\ntheir listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that vio\nlated\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconstitutional rights.\u201d 554 F. 3d, at\n1202. Second, it said that \u201cbecause this issue is not clear\nbased on the record before us on appeal . . . we remand to\nthe district court to determine the County\u2019s liability under\nMonell.\u201d Ibid. Third, it saw no reason to remand in re\n4            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nspect to the county\u2019s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor\nney\u2019s fees. That, it wrote, is because \u201cin our circuit . . . the\nlimitations to liability established in Monell do not apply\nto claims for prospective relief,\u201d such as the declaratory\njudgment that the Circuit had ordered entered.

Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644\n(CA9 2008); emphasis added).\n   The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned\nNinth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell\u2019s\n\u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies only to claims for\ndamages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because\nthe Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we\ngranted the county\u2019s petition for certiorari. Compare\nReynolds v.

Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held\nthat municipal entities were not \u201cperson[s]\u201d under \u00a71983.\nThe Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil\nRights Act of 1871\u2019s enactment. It noted that Congress\nrejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)\nthat would have made municipalities liable for damage\ndone by private persons \u201c \u2018riotously and tumultuously\nassembled.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 188\u2013190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,\nthe Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871\nHouse of Representatives that \u201c \u2018Congress had no constitu\ntional power to impose any obligation upon county and\ntown organizations, the mere instrumentality for the\nadministration of state law.\u2019 \u201d 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting\nCong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);\nemphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress\nmust have doubted its \u201cconstitutional power . . . to impose\ncivil liability on municipalities.\u201d 365 U. S., at 190. And\nfor that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude\nmunicipal corporations as \u00a71983 defendants. The statute\u2019s\nkey term \u201cperson\u201d therefore did not cover municipal enti\nties. Id., at 191.\n  Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered\nthe question of municipal liability. After reexamining the\n1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that\nCongress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not\nbecause it would have imposed liability upon municipali\n6           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nties, but because it would have imposed liability upon\nmunicipalities based purely upon the acts of others. That\nis to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed\nliability upon local governments \u201cwithout regard to\nwhether a local government was in any way at fault for\nthe breach of the peace for which it was to be held for\ndamages.\u201d 436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added). In\nMonell\u2019s view Congress may have thought that it lacked\nthe power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon\nmunicipalities, id., at 679, but \u201cnothing said in debate on\nthe Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a\nmunicipality liable . . . for its own violations of the Four\nteenth Amendment,\u201d id., at 683 (emphasis added). The\nCourt, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were\n\u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a71983. 436 U. S., at 690.\n  The Court also concluded that a municipality could not\nbe held liable under \u00a71983 solely because it employed a\ntortfeasor. The Court\u2019s conclusion rested on \u201cthe language\nof \u00a71983, read against the background of the same legisla\ntive history.\u201d Id., at 691. Section 1983\u2019s causation lan\nguage imposes liability on a \u201c \u2018person who . . . shall subject,\nor cause to be subjected, any person\u2019 \u201d to a deprivation of\nfederal rights. Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis de\nleted). That language, the Court observed, could not \u201cbe\neasily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the\nbasis of the existence of an employer-employee relation\nship with a tortfeasor.\u201d 436 U. S., at 692. The statute\u2019s\nlegislative history, in particular the constitutional objec\ntions that had been raised to the Sherman amendment,\nsupported this conclusion. Id., at 692\u201394, and n. 57.\n   For these reasons, the Court concluded that a munici\npality could be held liable under \u00a71983 only for its own\nviolations of federal law. Id., at 694. The Court described\nwhat made a violation a municipality\u2019s own violation:\n    \u201cLocal governing bodies, therefore, can be sued di\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    rectly under \u00a71983 for monetary, declaratory, or in\n    junctive relief where, as here, the action that is al\n    leged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a\n    policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision of\n    ficially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s offi\n    cers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations vis\n    ited pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though\n    such a custom has not received formal approval\n    through the body\u2019s official decisionmaking channels.\u201d\n    Id., at 690\u2013691 (footnote omitted).\nThe Court has also included the terms \u201cusage\u201d and \u201cprac\ntice\u201d as customs for which liability is appropriate. See\nibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action\nleads us here to use a shorthand term \u201cpolicy or custom,\u201d\nbut when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See\nid., at 694 (using the shorthand \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d); see\nalso, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555\nU. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase\n\u201ccustom, policy, or practice,\u201d to describe municipal liability\nunder \u00a71983).\n   In sum, in Monell the Court held that \u201ca municipality\ncannot be held liable\u201d solely for the acts of others, e.g.,\n\u201csolely because it employs a tortfeasor.\u201d 436 U. S., at 691.\nBut the municipality may be held liable \u201cwhen execution\nof a government\u2019s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.\u201d\nId., at 694 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  The language of \u00a71983 read in light of Monell\u2019s under\nstanding of the legislative history explains why claims for\nprospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall\nwithin the scope of the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement.\nNothing in the text of \u00a71983 suggests that the causation\nrequirement contained in the statute should change with\nthe form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the\nopposite when it provides that a person who meets \u00a71983\u2019s\n8           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nelements \u201cshall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Thus, as\nMonell explicitly stated, \u201c[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can\nbe sued directly under \u00a71983 for monetary, declaratory, or\ninjunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged\nto be unconstitutional implements or executes\u201d a policy or\ncustom. 436 U. S., at 690 (emphasis added). Monell went\non to quote this Court\u2019s statement in a 1973 case, Kenosha\nv. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 513, to the effect that the Con\ngress that enacted \u00a71983 did not intend the \u201c \u2018generic word\n\u201cperson\u201d . . . to have a bifurcated application to municipal\ncorporations depending on the nature of the relief sought\nagainst them.\u2019 \u201d 436 U. S., at 701, n. 66 (emphasis added).\nMonell added that \u201c[n]othing we say today affects\u201d this\npre-Monell \u201cconclusion.\u201d Ibid.\n   Monell\u2019s logic also argues against any such relief-based\nbifurcation. The Monell Court thought that Congress\nintended potential \u00a71983 liability where a municipality\u2019s\nown violations were at issue but not where only the viola\ntions of others were at issue. The \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d re\nquirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in\nlaw. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospec\ntive relief is at issue would undermine Monell\u2019s logic. For\nwhether an action or omission is a municipality\u2019s \u201cown\u201d\nhas to do with the nature of the action or omission, not\nwith the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n                               C\n  The Humphries\u2019 (hereinafter respondents) arguments to\nthe contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note\nthat by the time Monell reached the Supreme Court only\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 damages claim remained live. See id., at\n661. From this fact they conclude that the Court\u2019s holding\napplies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A\nholding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the\nspecific facts of the particular case. It does so here.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a\ndamages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that\nmunicipalities might have to pay large damages awards.\nThe Court so suggests when it points out that municipali\nties should not be liable for an employee\u2019s wrongful acts,\nsimply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat\nsuperior. But as we have pointed out, the Court\u2019s rejection\nof respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the\nmunicipality\u2019s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil\nity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality\u2019s\nown wrongful conduct.\n   Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief\nis at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court\ncannot grant prospective relief against a municipality\nunless the municipality\u2019s own conduct has caused the\nviolation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,\nthe Monell requirement \u201cshouldn\u2019t screen out any case.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,\nhowever, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces\nsary. If respondents are right, our holding may have\nlimited practical significance. But that possibility does not\nprovide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by\nadopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal\nliability that the Court has previously rejected.\n   Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument\nthat applying Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief\nclaims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional viola\ntions beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits\napply Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief, however,\nrespondents have not presented us with any actual or\nhypothetical example that provides serious cause for\nconcern.\n                      *    *     *\n  For these reasons, we hold that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or cus\n10         LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntom\u201d requirement applies in \u00a71983 cases irrespective of\nwhether the relief sought is monetary or prospective. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s contrary judgment is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
