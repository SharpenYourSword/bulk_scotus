RAY HOBBS, \n\n     DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF\n\n                CORRECTION\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09\u201310382.   Decided December 6, 2010\n\n\n   The motion of Scholars of Habeas Corpus Law for leave\nto file a brief as amici curiae is granted. The petition for a\nwrit of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\njoins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Today the Court refuses to review the Eighth Circuit\u2019s\nconclusion that a State may withhold an objection to a\nfederal habeas evidentiary hearing until after the hearing\nis complete, the constitutional violation established, and\nhabeas relief granted. Because I believe such a rule en\nables, and even invites, States to manipulate federal\nhabeas proceedings to their own strategic advantage at an\nunacceptable cost to justice, I respectfully dissent.\n   Petitioner Marcel Wayne Williams was charged with\ncapital murder, kidnapping, rape, and aggravated robbery.\nAt trial, his attorneys conceded guilt in the opening\nstatement, apparently hoping to establish credibility with\nthe jury and ultimately to convince the jury to recommend\na sentence of life without parole. Despite adopting this\nstrategy, however, Williams\u2019 attorneys called only one\nwitness at the penalty phase, an inmate who had no per\nsonal relationship with Williams and who testified from\nhis own experience that life was more pleasant on death\nrow than in the general prison population. Not surpris\ningly, the jury unanimously recommended a death sen\ntence. The trial court sentenced Williams to death by\nlethal injection, and the Arkansas Supreme Court af\n2                   WILLIAMS v. HOBBS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal.\nWilliams v. State, 338 Ark. 97, 991 S. W. 2d 565 (1999).\n   After the Arkansas courts denied his petition for collat\neral relief, Williams filed a federal habeas petition under\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. Williams alleged that he received inef\nfective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washing\nton, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), due to his attorneys\u2019 failure to\ndevelop and present mitigating social history evidence to\nthe jury. As to Strickland\u2019s performance prong, the Dis\ntrict Court held that the state-court decision denying\nWilliams\u2019 ineffective-assistance claim was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d Wil\nliams v. Norris, No. 5:02CV00450, 2006 WL 1699835, *8\n(ED Ark., June 19, 2006). As to prejudice, the court con\ncluded that the record was inconclusive and ordered an\nevidentiary hearing. The testimony at the hearing estab\nlished that Williams had been \u201csubject to every category of\ntraumatic experience that is generally used to describe\nchildhood trauma\u201d: sexual abuse by multiple perpetrators;\nphysical and psychological abuse by his mother and step\nfather; gross medical, nutritional, and educational neglect;\nexposure to violence in the childhood home and neighbor\nhood; and a violent gang-rape while in prison as an ado\nlescent. 2007 WL 1100417, *2 (Apr. 11, 2007). On the\nbasis of that testimony, the District Court found that\nWilliams had been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffective\nassistance, granted habeas relief, and ordered the State to\nafford Williams a new trial at the penalty phase or to\nreduce his sentence to life without parole. Id., at *2\u2013*3.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed, reinstating the sentence\nof death by lethal injection. Williams v. Norris, 576 F. 3d\n850 (CA8 2009). Concluding that Williams was not enti\ntled to a federal evidentiary hearing in the first place and\nentirely disregarding the evidence introduced at the hear\ning as a result, the court held that Williams had failed to\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprove prejudice \u201con the factual record he developed in\nstate court.\u201d Id., at 863. Thus, although the District\nCourt found that the State never \u201cobject[ed] to [the court\u2019s\ndecision] to conduct an evidentiary hearing\u201d nor \u201cargued\nthat [it] should not consider that evidence\u201d in ruling on\nWilliams\u2019 petition, 2007 WL 1100417, *2, n. 1; see also id.,\nat *3, the Court of Appeals held that the State had in fact\nobjected to the hearing. In the alternative, the Court of\nAppeals concluded that it would \u201cexercise [its] discretion\nto review the district court\u2019s non-compliance with\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u201d even if the State had not objected. 576 F. 3d,\nat 860.\n  To be sure, under \u00a72254(e)(2), if a habeas petitioner \u201chas\nfailed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court\nproceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hear\ning on the claim\u201d unless certain conditions are met. Had\nthe State invoked this section in the District Court, the\nhearing may have been barred for the reasons given by the\nCourt of Appeals. But whether \u00a72254(e)(2) barred the\nhearing is a separate question from whether the State\u2019s\n\u00a72254(e)(2) objection was properly before the Court of\nAppeals in the first place. As to that threshold question,\nneither of the holdings adopted by the court below with\nstands scrutiny.\n  First, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the State\nobjected in the District Court to the evidentiary hearing is\npatently wrong. As proof of an objection, the Court of\nAppeals found one sentence in the record where the State\nasserted that a federal habeas court \u201cis prevented from re\ntrying a state criminal case.\u201d 576 F. 3d, at 860 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). According to the Court of Ap\npeals, this statement amounted to an objection to the\nhearing because it \u201cincorporated the fundamental purpose\nbehind the restrictions on evidentiary hearings in\n\u00a72254(e)(2).\u201d Ibid. As a general matter, however, a party\nwishing to raise an objection and preserve an issue for\n4                   WILLIAMS v. HOBBS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nappeal must \u201cpu[t] the court on notice as to [its] concern,\u201d\nBeech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U. S. 153, 174 (1988).\nAbsolutely nothing in the State\u2019s general statement\u2014or\nany other part of the record, for that matter\u2014put the\nDistrict Court, or Williams, on notice that the State con\ntested Williams\u2019 entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\nEven if a State need not spell out its opposition to an\nevidentiary hearing in precise terms, I cannot fathom how\nthis statement of a general principle of law\u2014a principle\nthat is no less true even when a federal evidentiary hear\ning is proper\u2014could suffice.\n  Indeed, rather than reveal an objection to the hearing,\nthe record indicates that the State affirmatively consented\nto the hearing and sought to use the hearing to its own\nstrategic advantage. Williams made multiple straightfor\nward requests for an evidentiary hearing in no unclear\nterms. And, the District Court clearly informed the State\nof its intent to grant that request, giving the State every\nopportunity to object that a hearing was improper because\nWilliams had \u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of [his]\nclaim\u201d in state court, \u00a72254(e)(2). Rather than protest, the\nState requested that the court narrow the issues on which\nevidence would be heard and that the hearing be resched\nuled due to the unavailability of its own witness. The\nState then relied on new evidence developed at the hearing\nto contest the court\u2019s prior conclusion, on the state-court\nrecord, that defense counsel\u2019s performance had been defi\ncient. The State presented the same evidence on appeal,\nalthough there it also argued\u2014inconsistently and for the\nvery first time\u2014that the hearing had been improper. I\nsimply cannot see how this record suggests anything other\nthan a deliberate strategy by the State to use the hearing\nto fortify the record in support of the state-court decision\nand to object to the hearing only if and when that strategy\nfailed.\n  Second, with respect to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s alternative\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nholding that it would, in any event, \u201cexercise [its] discre\ntion to review the district court\u2019s non-compliance with\n\u00a72254(e)(2),\u201d 576 F. 3d, at 860, the Court of Appeals seri\nously misapplied our precedent. The court assumed that\nit possessed discretion to consider an objection to an evi\ndentiary hearing that is asserted only after the hearing\nhas been conducted, the constitutional violation estab\nlished, and habeas relief granted, relying on this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006). In\nthat case, we held that \u201cdistrict courts are permitted, but\nnot obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a\nstate prisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209. Even as\nsuming that same discretion applies in these circum\nstances,* Day makes clear that the court must \u201c \u2018determine\nwhether the interests of justice would be better served\u2019 \u201d by\nallowing the State\u2019s unasserted defense to expire without\ncourt intervention. Id., at 210 (quoting Granberry v.\nGreer, 481 U. S. 129, 136 (1987)). In particular, and of\ncritical significance to this case, the court must evaluate\nwhether anything \u201cin the record suggests that the State\n\u2018strategically\u2019 withheld the defense or chose to relinquish\nit.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 211. If so, the court \u201cwould not be\nat liberty to disregard that choice.\u201d Id., at 210, n. 11.\nThus, even assuming Day applied here, it required the\nCourt of Appeals to search the record for a suggestion of\nstrategic forfeiture. Yet, despite the record described\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Although we have never decided whether the courts of appeals pos\nsess discretion to consider after-the-fact objections of the kind here, we\nhave at least left open the possibility that a State might forfeit such an\nobjection if the State fails to raise it properly. See Bradshaw v. Richey,\n546 U. S. 74, 79\u201380 (2005) (per curiam) (remanding for the Sixth\nCircuit to address the argument that the State \u201cfailed to preserve its\nobjection to the [court\u2019s] reliance on evidence not presented in state\ncourt by failing to raise this argument properly\u201d); Holland v. Jackson,\n542 U. S. 649, 653, n. (2004) (per curiam) (rejecting the contention that\nthe State had failed to preserve its objection on the record present\nthere).\n6                   WILLIAMS v. HOBBS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nabove, which at the very least raises the possibility of a\ndeliberate decision by the State, the Court of Appeals\nfailed to consider the question at all.\n   Day also would require the Court of Appeals to \u201cassure\nitself\u201d that Williams would not be \u201csignificantly prejudiced\nby the delayed focus\u201d on his entitlement to a federal evi\ndentiary hearing. Id., at 210. Williams raised just this\npoint in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the State\u2019s\nuntimely objection to the evidentiary hearing had \u201cde\nprived [him] of any opportunity to present facts that would\nshow his entitlement to a hearing under the applicable\nstandard.\u201d Brief for Appellee/Cross-Appellant and Adden\ndum in No. 07\u20131984 etc. (CA8), p. 8. This, too, the court\nfailed to address.\n   In fact, the Court of Appeals made no mention of\u2014and\napparently gave no consideration to\u2014any countervailing\ninterests weighing against review of the State\u2019s untimely\n\u00a72254(e)(2) challenge. Such interests are certainly signifi\ncant where, as here, the evidence at the hearing led the\nDistrict Court to conclude that a constitutional violation\nhad occurred and that a capital sentence must be set\naside. Indeed, the relevant interests to be considered\ninclude not only interests of finality and comity (the singu\nlar focus of the Court of Appeals), but also the interest of\nremedying a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d that is evident after\n\u201ca full trial has been held in the district court.\u201d Gran\nberry, 481 U. S., at 135.\n   In my opinion, the interests of justice are poorly served\nby a rule that allows a State to object to an evidentiary\nhearing only after the hearing has been completed and the\nState has lost. Cf. Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. \u2014,\n\u2014 (2009) (slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he contemporaneous-objection\nrule prevents a litigant from \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014\nremaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising\nthe error only if the case does not conclude in his favor\u201d).\nIt is true, as the Court of Appeals emphasized, that the\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npolicy against evidentiary hearings in federal habeas\npromotes principles of comity and federalism. See Wil\nliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436\u2013437 (2000). But when\nthe State voluntarily participates in a federal evidentiary\nhearing\u2014without objection, with an apparent intent of\nsupplementing the record for its own purposes, and at a\nsignificant cost and expenditure of judicial resources\u2014\nthese interests are significantly diminished if not alto\ngether absent. We have refused to adopt rules that \u201cwould\npermit, and might even encourage, the State to seek a\nfavorable ruling on the merits in the district court while\nholding [a] defense in reserve for use on appeal if neces\nsary.\u201d Granberry, 481 U. S., at 132. Because I believe the\nopinion below does just that, at an unacceptable cost to the\ninterests of justice generally and in this particular case, I\nwould grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate\nthe judgment below.\n",

S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nholding that it would, in any event, \u201cexercise [its] discre\ntion to review the district court\u2019s non-compliance with\n\u00a72254(e)(2),\u201d 576 F. 3d, at 860, the Court of Appeals seri\nously misapplied our precedent. The court assumed that\nit possessed discretion to consider an objection to an evi\ndentiary hearing that is asserted only after the hearing\nhas been conducted, the constitutional violation estab\nlished, and habeas relief granted, relying on this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006). In\nthat case, we held that \u201cdistrict courts are permitted, but\nnot obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a\nstate prisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209. Even as\nsuming that same discretion applies in these circum\nstances,* Day makes clear that the court must \u201c \u2018determine\nwhether the interests of justice would be better served\u2019 \u201d by\nallowing the State\u2019s unasserted defense to expire without\ncourt intervention. Id., at 210 (quoting Granberry v.\nGreer, 481 U. S. 129, 136 (1987)). In particular, and of\ncritical significance to this case, the court must evaluate\nwhether anything \u201cin the record suggests that the State\n\u2018strategically\u2019 withheld the defense or chose to relinquish\nit.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 211. If so, the court \u201cwould not be\nat liberty to disregard that choice.\u201d Id., at 210, n. 11.\nThus, even assuming Day applied here, it required the\nCourt of Appeals to search the record for a suggestion of\nstrategic forfeiture. Yet, despite the record described\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Although we have never decided whether the courts of appeals pos\nsess discretion to consider after-the-fact objections of the kind here, we\nhave at least left open the possibility that a State might forfeit such an\nobjection if the State fails to raise it properly. See Bradshaw v. Richey,\n546 U. S. 74, 79\u201380 (2005) (per curiam) (remanding for the Sixth\nCircuit to address the argument that the State \u201cfailed to preserve its\nobjection to the [court\u2019s] reliance on evidence not presented in state\ncourt by failing to raise this argument properly\u201d); Holland v. Jackson,\n542 U. S. 649, 653, n. (2004) (per curiam) (rejecting the contention that\nthe State had failed to preserve its objection on the record present\nthere).\n6                   WILLIAMS v. HOBBS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nabove, which at the very least raises the possibility of a\ndeliberate decision by the State, the Court of Appeals\nfailed to consider the question at all.\n   Day also would require the Court of Appeals to \u201cassure\nitself\u201d that Williams would not be \u201csignificantly prejudiced\nby the delayed focus\u201d on his entitlement to a federal evi\ndentiary hearing. Id., at 210. Williams raised just this\npoint in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the State\u2019s\nuntimely objection to the evidentiary hearing had \u201cde\nprived [him] of any opportunity to present facts that would\nshow his entitlement to a hearing under the applicable\nstandard.\u201d Brief for Appellee/Cross-Appellant and Adden\ndum in No. 07\u20131984 etc. (CA8), p. 8. This, too, the court\nfailed to address.\n   In fact, the Court of Appeals made no mention of\u2014and\napparently gave no consideration to\u2014any countervailing\ninterests weighing against review of the State\u2019s untimely\n\u00a72254(e)(2) challenge. Such interests are certainly signifi\ncant where, as here, the evidence at the hearing led the\nDistrict Court to conclude that a constitutional violation\nhad occurred and that a capital sentence must be set\naside. Indeed, the relevant interests to be considered\ninclude not only interests of finality and comity (the singu\nlar focus of the Court of Appeals), but also the interest of\nremedying a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d that is evident after\n\u201ca full trial has been held in the district court.\u201d Gran\nberry, 481 U. S., at 135.\n   In my opinion, the interests of justice are poorly served\nby a rule that allows a State to object to an evidentiary\nhearing only after the hearing has been completed and the\nState has lost. Cf. Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. \u2014,\n\u2014 (2009) (slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he contemporaneous-objection\nrule prevents a litigant from \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014\nremaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising\nthe error only if the case does not conclude in his favor\u201d).\nIt is true, as the Court of Appeals emphasized, that the\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npolicy against evidentiary hearings in federal habeas\npromotes principles of comity and federalism. See Wil\nliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436\u2013437 (2000). But when\nthe State voluntarily participates in a federal evidentiary\nhearing\u2014without objection, with an apparent intent of\nsupplementing the record for its own purposes, and at a\nsignificant cost and expenditure of judicial resources\u2014\nthese interests are significantly diminished if not alto\ngether absent. We have refused to adopt rules that \u201cwould\npermit, and might even encourage, the State to seek a\nfavorable ruling on the merits in the district court while\nholding [a] defense in reserve for use on appeal if neces\nsary.\u201d Granberry, 481 U. S., at 132. Because I believe the\nopinion below does just that, at an unacceptable cost to the\ninterests of justice generally and in this particular case, I\nwould grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate\nthe judgment below.\n</pre>",
