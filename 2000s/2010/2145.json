C. voters who\nwould like to subject the District of Columbia\u2019s Religious\nFreedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of\n2009 to a public referendum before it goes into effect,\npursuant to procedures set forth in the D. C. Charter. See\nD. C. Code \u00a7\u00a71\u2013204.101 to 1\u2013204.107 (2001\u20132006). The\nAct expands the definition of marriage in the District to\ninclude same-sex couples. See D. C. Act 18\u2013248; 57 D. C.\nReg. 27 (Jan. 1, 2010).\n  The D. C. Charter specifies that legislation enacted by\nthe D. C. Council may be blocked if a sufficient number of\nvoters request a referendum on the issue. D. C. Code \u00a71\u2013\n204.102. The Council, however, purported in 1979 to\nexempt from this provision any referendum that would\nviolate the D. C. Human Rights Act.              See \u00a7\u00a71\u2013\n1001.16(b)(1)(C), 2\u20131402.73 (2001\u20132007). The D. C. Board\nof Elections, D. C. Superior Court, and D. C. Court of\nAppeals denied petitioners\u2019 request for a referendum on\nthe grounds that the referendum would violate the Human\nRights Act.\n  Petitioners argue that this action was improper, because\nD.C. Council legislation providing that a referendum is not\nrequired cannot trump a provision of the D. C. Charter\nspecifying that a referendum is required. See Price v.\n2        JACKSON v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BD. OF \n\n                ELECTIONS AND ETHICS\n\n                    Opinion in Chambers \n\n\nDistrict of Columbia Bd. of Elections, 645 A. 2d 594, 599\u2013\n600 (D. C. 1994). They point out that if the Act does be\ncome law, they will permanently lose any right to pursue a\nreferendum under the Charter. See \u00a71\u2013204.102(b)(2)\n(2001\u20132006). Petitioners ask the Court for a stay that\nwould prevent the Act from going into effect, as expected,\non March 3, 2010.\n  This argument has some force. Without addressing the\nmerits of petitioners\u2019 underlying claim, however, I con\nclude that a stay is not warranted. First, as \u201ca matter of\njudicial policy\u201d\u2014if not \u201cjudicial power\u201d\u2014\u201cit has been the\npractice of the Court to defer to the decisions of the courts\nof the District of Columbia on matters of exclusively local\nconcern.\u201d Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 687\n(1980); see also Fisher v. United States, 328 U. S. 463, 476\n(1946).\n  Second, the Act at issue was adopted by the Council and\nplaced before Congress for the 30-day period of review\nrequired by the D. C. Charter, see \u00a71\u2013206.02(c)(1). A joint\nresolution of disapproval by Congress would prevent the\nAct from going into effect, but Congress has chosen not to\nact. The challenged provision purporting to exempt cer\ntain D. C. Council actions from the referendum process,\n\u00a71\u20131001.16(b)(1)(C), was itself subject to review by Con\ngress before it went into effect. While these considerations\nare of course not determinative of the legal issues, they do\nweigh against granting petitioners\u2019 request for a stay,\ngiven that the concern is that action by the Council vio\nlates an Act of Congress.\n  Finally, while petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Act by way of\na referendum apparently will become moot when the Act\ngoes into effect, petitioners have also pursued a ballot\ninitiative, under related procedures in the D. C. Charter,\nthat would give D. C. voters a similar opportunity to re\npeal the Act if they so choose. See \u00a7\u00a71\u2013204.101 to 1\u2013\n204.107; Jackson v. District of Columbia Bd. of Elections\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  3\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nand Ethics, Civ. A. No. 2009 CA 008613 B (D. C. Super.,\nJan. 14, 2010). Their separate petition for a ballot initia\ntive is now awaiting consideration by the D. C. Court of\nAppeals, which will need to address many of the same\nlegal questions that petitioners have raised here. Unlike\ntheir petition for a referendum, however, the request for\nan initiative will not become moot when the Act becomes\nlaw. On the contrary, the D. C. Court of Appeals will have\nthe chance to consider the relevant legal questions on\ntheir merits, and petitioners will have the right to chal\nlenge any adverse decision through a petition for certiorari\nin this Court at the appropriate time.\n   The foregoing considerations, taken together, lead me to\nconclude that the Court is unlikely to grant certiorari in\nthis case. Accordingly, the request for a stay is denied.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",
