C. \u00a7227,\nwhich authorizes a \u201c[p]rivate right of action\u201d when a per\nson is \u201cotherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of\na State\u201d to bring the action. \u00a7227(b)(3).\n  The District Court dismissed Holster\u2019s suit based on\nN.

The District Court noted that,\npursuant to \u00a7901(b), New York courts had closed their\ndoors to class actions seeking statutory damages under the\nTCPA. 485 F.
