GATCO, INC. DBA FOLIO\n                ASSOCIATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 08\u20131307. Decided April 19, 2010 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\njudgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for\nfurther consideration in light of Shady Grove Orthopedic\nAssociates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this petition.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.\n   Petitioner Charles Holster filed this suit in federal court\nseeking actual and statutory damages\u2014on behalf of him\nself and a class of others similarly situated\u2014for alleged\nviolations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of\n1991, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227. The District Court dismissed the\nsuit, holding that the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304\nU. S. 64 (1938), applies to federal suits under the Act, and\nthat N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b) (West 2006)\u2014\nwhich bars class actions in suits seeking statutory dam\nages\u2014is \u201csubstantive\u201d under Erie. 485 F. Supp. 2d 179,\n184\u2013186 (EDNY 2007). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nhad no bearing, it added, because \u201c\u00a7901(b) is a matter not\ncovered by [Rule] 23.\u201d Id., at 185, n. 3.\n   The Second Circuit summarily affirmed on the basis of\nits decision (issued the same day by the same panel) in\nBonime v. Avaya, Inc., 547 F. 3d 497 (2008). Bonime held\nthat \u00a7901(b) applies to suits brought under the Act in\nfederal court for two reasons. First, it read the Act to\nrequire that federal courts treat claims under the Act as\nthough they arise under state law and therefore are sub\n2                 HOLSTER v. GATCO, INC.\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nject to Erie. 547 F. 3d, at 501. Second, Bonime held that\n\u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s text\u2014which provides that \u201c[a] person or entity\nmay, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of\na State, bring in an appropriate court of that State\u201d a suit\nfor actual and statutory damages\u2014forbids federal courts\nfrom hearing suits under the Act that would be barred in\nstate court. 547 F. 3d, at 502.\n   Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins.\nCo., 559 U. S. ___ (2010), held that, irrespective of Erie,\n\u00a7901(b) does not apply to state-law claims in federal court\nbecause it is validly pre-empted by Rule 23. Id., at ___\u2013\n___ (slip op., at 3\u201312); id., at ___\u2013___ (plurality opinion)\n(slip op., at 12\u201316); id., at ___\u2013___ (STEVENS, J., concur\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 14\u2013\n22). That holding assuredly affects\u2014and in all likelihood\neliminates\u2014Bonime\u2019s primary basis for applying \u00a7901(b)\nin federal court. The dissent insists, however, that\nBonime\u2019s second ground remains unaffected. Post, at 3\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.).\n   On one reading of Bonime\u2019s opaque second ground, that\nis true: If the Second Circuit meant that \u00a7227(b)(3) re\nquires federal courts hearing claims under the Act to\napply all state procedural rules that would effectively bar\na suit, then Shady Grove has no bearing. That is, how\never, a highly implausible reading of the Act. Besides\neffecting an implied partial repeal of the Rules Enabling\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, it would require federal courts to\nenforce any prerequisite to suit state law makes manda\ntory\u2014a state rule limiting the length of the complaint, for\nexample, or specifying the color and size of the paper.\n   A more probable meaning of Bonime\u2019s second ground is\nthat when a State closes its doors to claims under the Act\n\u00a7227(b)(3) requires federal courts in the State to do so as\nwell; but when such claims are allowed, the federal forum\nmay apply its own procedures in processing them. See 547\nF. 3d, at 502 (\u201cThis statutory language is unambiguous\u2014a\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nclaim under the [Act] cannot be brought if not permitted\nby state law\u201d). Nothing in Bonime suggests, for example,\nthat a federal court could not consolidate two suits under\nthe Act for its own convenience, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n42(a), even if the State\u2019s courts did not allow consolidation.\nAlthough that logic applies equally to Rule 23\u2019s method of\ncombining claims, Bonime may simply have assumed\u2014as\nthe appellee urged it to conclude,1 as a number of district\ncourts had held,2 and as the Second Circuit itself held\nthree weeks later3\u2014that Rule 23 does not address whether\nclass actions are available for specific claims. If that is\nwhat Bonime had in mind, Shady Grove will likely affect\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s analysis.\n   Shady Grove would also affect the outcome if the\nBonime court believed that even if Rule 23 would other\nwise allow a federal court to entertain a class action,\n\u00a7227(b)(3) supersedes Rule 23 by precluding suits that\ncannot be brought in state courts, including class actions\nbarred by \u00a7901(b). Shady Grove reveals the error in this\nanalysis: Section 901(b) does not prevent a plaintiff from\nbringing \u201can action to recover a penalty, or minimum\nmeasure of recovery created or imposed by statute\u201d\u2014as\nwould be necessary to implicate \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2014but only from\n\u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such a suit \u201cas a class action\u201d (emphasis\nadded).
