In keeping with a school tradi\u00ad\ntion, the school\u2019s band director told the seniors in the\nensemble that they could select a piece from their musical\nrepertoire to be performed during their graduation cere\u00ad\nmony. The 2006 graduates, including petitioner, chose\nFranz Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria,\u201d1 a piece that they had previ\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Many   composers, including Schubert, Gounod, Verdi, Mozart, Elgar,\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns, Rossini, Brahms, Stravinsky, Bruckner, and Rachman\u00ad\ninoff, composed music for the Ave Maria.

At the prior year\u2019s\ngraduation ceremony, the student choir had performed\n\u201c \u2018Up Above My Head,\u2019 a vocal piece which included ex\u00ad\npress references to \u2018God,\u2019 \u2018heaven,\u2019 and \u2018angels,\u2019 \u201d and the\nschool district claimed that this had resulted in \u201ccom\u00ad\nplaints from graduation attendees\u201d and at least one angry\nletter to the editor of a local newspaper. Ibid.; id., at 1101\n(M. Smith, J., dissenting in part and concurring in judg\u00ad\nment) (quoting lyrics); see also Brief in Opposition 7, and\nn. 28. Fearful that the performance of Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria\u201d\nwould cause a similar reaction, even though the perform\u00ad\nance would not include the lyrics of the piece, school dis\u00ad\ntrict officials vetoed the ensemble members\u2019 choice \u201cbe\u00ad\ncause the title and meaning of the piece had religious\nconnotations\u2014and would be easily identified as such by\nattendees merely by the title alone.\u201d 580 F. 3d, at 1091.\nThe associate superintendent sent an e-mail to all the\nprincipals in the district instructing them that \u201cmusical\nselections for all graduations within the District should be\npurely secular in nature.\u201d2 Ibid.

The District\nCourt granted summary judgment for the superintendent,\nand a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 580\nF. 3d 1087. The majority acknowledged that the perform\u00ad\nance of \u201can entirely instrumental\u201d musical piece \u201cis speech\nas contemplated by the First Amendment,\u201d and assumed,\nas the school district had conceded, that the school had\ncreated a \u201c \u2018limited public forum\u2019 \u201d when it allowed the\nmembers of the wind ensemble to choose the piece that\nthey wished to play. Id., at 1093\u20131094. Nevertheless, the\nmajority held that the vetoing of the ensemble members\u2019\nselection had not violated their free speech rights because\n\u201cit is reasonable for a school official to prohibit the per\u00ad\nformance of an obviously religious piece\u201d \u201cwhen there is a\ncaptive audience at a graduation ceremony, which spans a\nfinite amount of time, and during which the demand for\nequal time is so great that comparable non-religious musi\u00ad\ncal works might not be presented.\u201d Id., at 1095. Dissent\u00ad\ning on the free speech issue, Judge Smith expressed con\u00ad\ncern that the panel\u2019s decision would encourage public\nschool administrators to ban \u201cmusical and artistic presen\u00ad\ntations by their students in school-sponsored limited\npublic fora where those presentations contain any trace of\nreligious inspiration, for fear of criticism by a member of\nthe public, however extreme that person\u2019s views may be.\u201d\nId., at 1099.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1989), http://trnmusic.com/pdfs/scorepdfs/onahymnsongofphilipbliss.pdf (as\nvisited Mar. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see\nalso R. Garofalo, On a Hymnsong of Philip Bliss: A Teaching/Learning\nUnit 9 (2000). Whatever distinction the district perceived between this\npiece and Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria\u201d is not revealed by the record.\n4                   NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n   When a public school administration speaks for itself\nand takes public responsibility for its speech, it may say\nwhat it wishes without violating the First Amendment\u2019s\nguarantee of freedom of speech. Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, 555 U. S., ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4\u20135). But\nwhen a public school purports to allow students to express\nthemselves, it must respect the students\u2019 free speech\nrights. School administrators may not behave like puppet\nmasters who create the illusion that students are engag\u00ad\ning in personal expression when in fact the school admini\u00ad\nstration is pulling the strings.\n   Our cases use the term \u201climited public forum\u201d to de\u00ad\nscribe a situation in which a public school purports to\nallow students to express their own views or sentiments.\nSee Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819, 829\u2013830 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.\n263, 272\u2013273 (1981); see also Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry\nLocal Educators\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45\u201348 (1983). In\nsuch a forum, we have held, the State \u201cmust not discrimi\u00ad\nnate against speech on the basis of viewpoint.\u201d Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106 (2001);\nsee also Rosenberger, supra, at 829. Our cases also make\nit perfectly clear that discrimination against religious, as\nopposed to secular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\nGood News Club, supra, at 107; Rosenberger, supra, at\n830, 831; Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free\nSchool Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 393\u2013394 (1993). And our cases\ncategorically reject the proposition that speech may be\ncensored simply because some in the audience may find\nthat speech distasteful. See United States v. Playboy\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 814\u2013816 (2000);\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); Board of Ed.,\nIsland Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457\nU. S. 853, 871\u2013872 (1982) (plurality opinion); Tinker v. Des\nMoines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n503, 508\u2013509 (1969).\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals held that a\npublic school did not violate the free speech rights of a\nstudent when the school, after creating a limited public\nforum, banned the performance of \u201can obviously religious\npiece\u201d because the piece might offend some members of the\n\u201ccaptive audience at a graduation ceremony.\u201d 580 F. 3d,\nat 1095. The tension between this reasoning and the\nfundamental free speech principles noted above is unmis\u00ad\ntakable.\n   The Court of Appeals, in a footnote, acknowledged that\nthe district\u2019s decision would have been impermissible if it\nhad constituted viewpoint discrimination, but the court\nconcluded that \u201cthis is not a case involving viewpoint\ndiscrimination\u201d because petitioner \u201cconcede[d] that she\nwas not attempting to express any specific religious view\u00ad\npoint\u201d but instead \u201csought only to \u2018play a pretty piece.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 1095, n. 6. This reasoning is questionable at best.\n   First, the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding, as set out in the\nbody of its opinion, does not appear to depend in any way\non petitioner\u2019s motivation in helping to select the Biebl\npiece. The Court phrased its holding as follows: \u201c[T]he\nDistrict\u2019s action in keeping all musical performances at\ngraduation \u2018entirely secular\u2019 in nature was reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding a high school\ngraduation.\u201d Id., at 1095. Nothing in the body of the\ncourt\u2019s opinion suggests that its decision would have come\nout the other way if petitioner had favored the Biebl piece\nfor religious rather than artistic reasons. Second, the\nschool district did not veto the Biebl piece on viewpoint\u00ad\nneutral grounds. On the contrary, the district banned that\npiece precisely because of its perceived religious mes\u00ad\nsage\u2014that is, because the district feared that members of\nthe audience would view the performance of the piece as\nthe district\u2019s sponsorship of a religious message. See Pet.\nfor Cert. 7 (quoting letter to the editor criticizing 2005\n6                  NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngraduation program). Banning speech because of the view\nthat the speech is likely to be perceived as expressing\nseems to me to constitute viewpoint discrimination.\n   The decision below will have important implications for\nthe nearly 10 million public school students in the Ninth\nCircuit. Even if the decision is read narrowly, it will\nrestrict what is purportedly personal student expression\nat public school graduation ceremonies. And as Judge\nSmith noted, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning may be applied\nto almost all public school artistic performances. 580\nF. 3d, at 1099 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring\nin judgment). The audience at such events, which gener\u00ad\nally consists overwhelmingly of relatives and friends of the\nperformers, may be regarded as no less \u201ccaptive\u201d than\ngraduation attendees. If the decision is applied to such\nperformances, school administrators in some communities\nmay choose to avoid \u201ccontroversy\u201d by banishing all musical\npieces with \u201creligious connotations.\u201d Id., at 1095, 1091\n(majority opinion).\n   The logic of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision has even\nbroader implications. Why, for example, should the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s reasoning apply only to musical performances\nand not to other forms of student expression, including\nstudent speeches at graduation ceremonies and other\ncomparable school events? Moreover, unless discrimina\u00ad\ntion against speech expressing a religious viewpoint is less\nobjectionable than other forms of viewpoint discrimina\u00ad\ntion, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision may provide the basis for\nwide-ranging censorship of student speech that expresses\ncontroversial ideas. A reasonable reading of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s decision is that it authorizes school administra\u00ad\ntors to ban any controversial student expression at any\nschool event attended by parents and others who feel\nobligated to be present because of the importance of the\nevent for the participating students. A decision with such\npotentially broad and troubling implications merits our\nreview.\n",

Dissent\u00ad\ning on the free speech issue, Judge Smith expressed con\u00ad\ncern that the panel\u2019s decision would encourage public\nschool administrators to ban \u201cmusical and artistic presen\u00ad\ntations by their students in school-sponsored limited\npublic fora where those presentations contain any trace of\nreligious inspiration, for fear of criticism by a member of\nthe public, however extreme that person\u2019s views may be.\u201d\nId., at 1099.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1989), http://trnmusic.com/pdfs/scorepdfs/onahymnsongofphilipbliss.pdf (as\nvisited Mar. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see\nalso R.

Whatever distinction the district perceived between this\npiece and Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria\u201d is not revealed by the record.\n4                   NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n   When a public school administration speaks for itself\nand takes public responsibility for its speech, it may say\nwhat it wishes without violating the First Amendment\u2019s\nguarantee of freedom of speech. Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, 555 U. S., ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4\u20135). But\nwhen a public school purports to allow students to express\nthemselves, it must respect the students\u2019 free speech\nrights. School administrators may not behave like puppet\nmasters who create the illusion that students are engag\u00ad\ning in personal expression when in fact the school admini\u00ad\nstration is pulling the strings.\n   Our cases use the term \u201climited public forum\u201d to de\u00ad\nscribe a situation in which a public school purports to\nallow students to express their own views or sentiments.\nSee Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819, 829\u2013830 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.\n263, 272\u2013273 (1981); see also Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry\nLocal Educators\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45\u201348 (1983). In\nsuch a forum, we have held, the State \u201cmust not discrimi\u00ad\nnate against speech on the basis of viewpoint.\u201d Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106 (2001);\nsee also Rosenberger, supra, at 829. Our cases also make\nit perfectly clear that discrimination against religious, as\nopposed to secular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\nGood News Club, supra, at 107; Rosenberger, supra, at\n830, 831; Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free\nSchool Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 393\u2013394 (1993). And our cases\ncategorically reject the proposition that speech may be\ncensored simply because some in the audience may find\nthat speech distasteful. See United States v. Playboy\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 814\u2013816 (2000);\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); Board of Ed.,\nIsland Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457\nU. S. 853, 871\u2013872 (1982) (plurality opinion); Tinker v. Des\nMoines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n503, 508\u2013509 (1969).\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals held that a\npublic school did not violate the free speech rights of a\nstudent when the school, after creating a limited public\nforum, banned the performance of \u201can obviously religious\npiece\u201d because the piece might offend some members of the\n\u201ccaptive audience at a graduation ceremony.\u201d 580 F. 3d,\nat 1095. The tension between this reasoning and the\nfundamental free speech principles noted above is unmis\u00ad\ntakable.\n   The Court of Appeals, in a footnote, acknowledged that\nthe district\u2019s decision would have been impermissible if it\nhad constituted viewpoint discrimination, but the court\nconcluded that \u201cthis is not a case involving viewpoint\ndiscrimination\u201d because petitioner \u201cconcede[d] that she\nwas not attempting to express any specific religious view\u00ad\npoint\u201d but instead \u201csought only to \u2018play a pretty piece.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 1095, n. 6. This reasoning is questionable at best.\n   First, the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding, as set out in the\nbody of its opinion, does not appear to depend in any way\non petitioner\u2019s motivation in helping to select the Biebl\npiece. The Court phrased its holding as follows: \u201c[T]he\nDistrict\u2019s action in keeping all musical performances at\ngraduation \u2018entirely secular\u2019 in nature was reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding a high school\ngraduation.\u201d Id., at 1095. Nothing in the body of the\ncourt\u2019s opinion suggests that its decision would have come\nout the other way if petitioner had favored the Biebl piece\nfor religious rather than artistic reasons. Second, the\nschool district did not veto the Biebl piece on viewpoint\u00ad\nneutral grounds. On the contrary, the district banned that\npiece precisely because of its perceived religious mes\u00ad\nsage\u2014that is, because the district feared that members of\nthe audience would view the performance of the piece as\nthe district\u2019s sponsorship of a religious message. See Pet.\nfor Cert. 7 (quoting letter to the editor criticizing 2005\n6                  NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngraduation program). Banning speech because of the view\nthat the speech is likely to be perceived as expressing\nseems to me to constitute viewpoint discrimination.\n   The decision below will have important implications for\nthe nearly 10 million public school students in the Ninth\nCircuit. Even if the decision is read narrowly, it will\nrestrict what is purportedly personal student expression\nat public school graduation ceremonies. And as Judge\nSmith noted, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning may be applied\nto almost all public school artistic performances. 580\nF. 3d, at 1099 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring\nin judgment). The audience at such events, which gener\u00ad\nally consists overwhelmingly of relatives and friends of the\nperformers, may be regarded as no less \u201ccaptive\u201d than\ngraduation attendees. If the decision is applied to such\nperformances, school administrators in some communities\nmay choose to avoid \u201ccontroversy\u201d by banishing all musical\npieces with \u201creligious connotations.\u201d Id., at 1095, 1091\n(majority opinion).\n   The logic of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision has even\nbroader implications. Why, for example, should the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s reasoning apply only to musical performances\nand not to other forms of student expression, including\nstudent speeches at graduation ceremonies and other\ncomparable school events? Moreover, unless discrimina\u00ad\ntion against speech expressing a religious viewpoint is less\nobjectionable than other forms of viewpoint discrimina\u00ad\ntion, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision may provide the basis for\nwide-ranging censorship of student speech that expresses\ncontroversial ideas. A reasonable reading of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s decision is that it authorizes school administra\u00ad\ntors to ban any controversial student expression at any\nschool event attended by parents and others who feel\nobligated to be present because of the importance of the\nevent for the participating students. A decision with such\npotentially broad and troubling implications merits our\nreview.\n</pre>",
