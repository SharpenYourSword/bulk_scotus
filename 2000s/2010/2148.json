The District\nCourt granted summary judgment for the superintendent,\nand a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 580\nF. 3d 1087. The majority acknowledged that the perform­\nance of “an entirely instrumental” musical piece “is speech\nas contemplated by the First Amendment,” and assumed,\nas the school district had conceded, that the school had\ncreated a “ ‘limited public forum’ ” when it allowed the\nmembers of the wind ensemble to choose the piece that\nthey wished to play. Id., at 1093–1094. Nevertheless, the\nmajority held that the vetoing of the ensemble members’\nselection had not violated their free speech rights because\n“it is reasonable for a school official to prohibit the per­\nformance of an obviously religious piece” “when there is a\ncaptive audience at a graduation ceremony, which spans a\nfinite amount of time, and during which the demand for\nequal time is so great that comparable non-religious musi­\ncal works might not be presented.” Id., at 1095. Dissent­\ning on the free speech issue, Judge Smith expressed con­\ncern that the panel’s decision would encourage public\nschool administrators to ban “musical and artistic presen­\ntations by their students in school-sponsored limited\npublic fora where those presentations contain any trace of\nreligious inspiration, for fear of criticism by a member of\nthe public, however extreme that person’s views may be.”\nId., at 1099.\n——————\n(1989), http://trnmusic.com/pdfs/scorepdfs/onahymnsongofphilipbliss.pdf (as\nvisited Mar. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); see\nalso R.

Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, 555 U. S., ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4–5). But\nwhen a public school purports to allow students to express\nthemselves, it must respect the students’ free speech\nrights. School administrators may not behave like puppet\nmasters who create the illusion that students are engag­\ning in personal expression when in fact the school admini­\nstration is pulling the strings.\n   Our cases use the term “limited public forum” to de­\nscribe a situation in which a public school purports to\nallow students to express their own views or sentiments.\nSee Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515\nU. S. 819, 829–830 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.\n263, 272–273 (1981); see also Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry\nLocal Educators’ Assn., 460 U.

S. 98, 106 (2001);\nsee also Rosenberger, supra, at 829.

The tension between this reasoning and the\nfundamental free speech principles noted above is unmis­\ntakable.\n   The Court of Appeals, in a footnote, acknowledged that\nthe district’s decision would have been impermissible if it\nhad constituted viewpoint discrimination, but the court\nconcluded that “this is not a case involving viewpoint\ndiscrimination” because petitioner “concede[d] that she\nwas not attempting to express any specific religious view­\npoint” but instead “sought only to ‘play a pretty piece.’ ”\nId., at 1095, n. 6. This reasoning is questionable at best.\n   First, the Court of Appeals’ holding, as set out in the\nbody of its opinion, does not appear to depend in any way\non petitioner’s motivation in helping to select the Biebl\npiece. The Court phrased its holding as follows: “[T]he\nDistrict’s action in keeping all musical performances at\ngraduation ‘entirely secular’ in nature was reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding a high school\ngraduation.” Id., at 1095. Nothing in the body of the\ncourt’s opinion suggests that its decision would have come\nout the other way if petitioner had favored the Biebl piece\nfor religious rather than artistic reasons. Second, the\nschool district did not veto the Biebl piece on viewpoint­\nneutral grounds. On the contrary, the district banned that\npiece precisely because of its perceived religious mes­\nsage—that is, because the district feared that members of\nthe audience would view the performance of the piece as\nthe district’s sponsorship of a religious message. See Pet.\nfor Cert. 7 (quoting letter to the editor criticizing 2005\n6                  NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngraduation program). Banning speech because of the view\nthat the speech is likely to be perceived as expressing\nseems to me to constitute viewpoint discrimination.\n   The decision below will have important implications for\nthe nearly 10 million public school students in the Ninth\nCircuit. Even if the decision is read narrowly, it will\nrestrict what is purportedly personal student expression\nat public school graduation ceremonies. And as Judge\nSmith noted, the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning may be applied\nto almost all public school artistic performances. 580\nF. 3d, at 1099 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring\nin judgment). The audience at such events, which gener­\nally consists overwhelmingly of relatives and friends of the\nperformers, may be regarded as no less “captive” than\ngraduation attendees. If the decision is applied to such\nperformances, school administrators in some communities\nmay choose to avoid “controversy” by banishing all musical\npieces with “religious connotations.” Id., at 1095, 1091\n(majority opinion).\n   The logic of the Ninth Circuit’s decision has even\nbroader implications. Why, for example, should the Ninth\nCircuit’s reasoning apply only to musical performances\nand not to other forms of student expression, including\nstudent speeches at graduation ceremonies and other\ncomparable school events? Moreover, unless discrimina­\ntion against speech expressing a religious viewpoint is less\nobjectionable than other forms of viewpoint discrimina­\ntion, the Ninth Circuit’s decision may provide the basis for\nwide-ranging censorship of student speech that expresses\ncontroversial ideas. A reasonable reading of the Ninth\nCircuit’s decision is that it authorizes school administra­\ntors to ban any controversial student expression at any\nschool event attended by parents and others who feel\nobligated to be present because of the importance of the\nevent for the participating students. A decision with such\npotentially broad and troubling implications merits our\nreview.\n</pre>", "id": 2148, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/03/22/Nurre_v._Whitehead.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                      Cite as: 559 U.

On the contrary, the district banned that\npiece precisely because of its perceived religious mes­\nsage—that is, because the district feared that members of\nthe audience would view the performance of the piece as\nthe district’s sponsorship of a religious message. See Pet.\nfor Cert. 7 (quoting letter to the editor criticizing 2005\n6                  NURRE v. WHITEHEAD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ngraduation program). Banning speech because of the view\nthat the speech is likely to be perceived as expressing\nseems to me to constitute viewpoint discrimination.\n   The decision below will have important implications for\nthe nearly 10 million public school students in the Ninth\nCircuit. Even if the decision is read narrowly, it will\nrestrict what is purportedly personal student expression\nat public school graduation ceremonies. And as Judge\nSmith noted, the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning may be applied\nto almost all public school artistic performances. 580\nF. 3d, at 1099 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring\nin judgment). The audience at such events, which gener­\nally consists overwhelmingly of relatives and friends of the\nperformers, may be regarded as no less “captive” than\ngraduation attendees. If the decision is applied to such\nperformances, school administrators in some communities\nmay choose to avoid “controversy” by banishing all musical\npieces with “religious connotations.” Id., at 1095, 1091\n(majority opinion).\n   The logic of the Ninth Circuit’s decision has even\nbroader implications. Why, for example, should the Ninth\nCircuit’s reasoning apply only to musical performances\nand not to other forms of student expression, including\nstudent speeches at graduation ceremonies and other\ncomparable school events? Moreover, unless discrimina­\ntion against speech expressing a religious viewpoint is less\nobjectionable than other forms of viewpoint discrimina­\ntion, the Ninth Circuit’s decision may provide the basis for\nwide-ranging censorship of student speech that expresses\ncontroversial ideas. A reasonable reading of the Ninth\nCircuit’s decision is that it authorizes school administra­\ntors to ban any controversial student expression at any\nschool event attended by parents and others who feel\nobligated to be present because of the importance of the\nevent for the participating students. A decision with such\npotentially broad and troubling implications merits our\nreview.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2148/", "sha1": "c0853cb9a4472bd264c16d8a0f65c0a60abb6273", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-20T17:03:24"}
