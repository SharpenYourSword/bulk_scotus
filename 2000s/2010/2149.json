ERIC H. \n\n             HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY\n\n                  GENERAL\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 08–7721. Decided March 1, 2010\n\n  The motion of petitioners for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are\ngranted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is re\nmanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit for further consideration in light of the\nposition asserted by the Solicitor General in her brief for\nthe respondent filed August 26, 2009.\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA,\nJUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n  I dissent from the Court’s decision to grant the petition,\nvacate the judgment, and remand the case. The Court\ndoes this in deference to the Government’s suggestion that\nthe Court of Appeals ignored petitioners’ nonconstitutional\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Government\ndoes not, however, take the position that the judgment\nreached by the Court of Appeals was incorrect, and this\nCourt has not independently examined the merits of that\njudgment. In such circumstances, there are insufficient\ngrounds for vacating the judgment below. See Nunez v.\nUnited States, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n  This disposition is especially inappropriate in this case,\nas petitioners do not appear to have raised—in the Court\nof Appeals or in their petition for certiorari—the claim\nthat the Government asserts was ignored by the Court of\nAppeals. Petitioners argued below that their counsel’s\n2                   MACHADO v. HOLDER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\npoor performance deprived them of their constitutional\nright to the effective assistance of counsel. But they did\nnot explicitly assert a right to effective assistance based on\nany source of law other than the Constitution. In their\npetition for certiorari, moreover, petitioners disclaimed\nany nonconstitutional basis for relief when they argued\nthat, by denying the existence of a constitutional right to\nthe effective assistance of counsel, the Fourth Circuit’s\ndecision “allow[s] no recourse for a particular alien against\ndishonest or corrupt immigration practitioners.” Pet. for\nCert. 11 (emphasis added). This sentence would make no\nsense if petitioners were advancing both constitutional\nand nonconstitutional grounds for relief on their claim.\n  Instead of granting, vacating, and remanding, I would\ndeny the petition for certiorari.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2149/", "sha1": "48e1e1417d28f004d2aee362924b49d60e4bcb61", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-20T17:03:24"}
