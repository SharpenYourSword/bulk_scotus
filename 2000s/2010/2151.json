S. ___ (2008) (slip op., at 36) (quoting Mar\u00ad\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)). This duty is\nparticularly compelling in cases that present an opportu\nnity to decide the constitutionality or enforceability of\nfederal statutes in a manner \u201cinsulated from the pressures\nof the moment,\u201d and in time to guide courts and the politi\ncal branches in resolving difficult questions concerning the\nproper \u201cexercise of governmental power.\u201d Hamdan v.\nRumsfeld, 548 U.

No. 109\u2013366, 120 Stat. 2631, pre\ncludes petitioner from invoking the Geneva Convention\nRelative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12,\n1949, as a source of rights in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d;\nand \u201c2. Whether, assuming petitioner can assert a claim\nbased on the Geneva Convention, his extradition to France\nwould violate the Convention.\u201d Brief in Opposition i (some\n2                      NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncitations omitted).1 Answering just the first of these ques\ntions would provide much-needed guidance on two impor\ntant issues with which the political branches and federal\ncourts have struggled since we decided Boumediene. The\nfirst is the extent, if any, to which provisions like Section 5\naffect 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241 in a manner that implicates the\nconstitutional guarantee of habeas corpus. The second is\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable.\n   It is incumbent upon us to provide what guidance we\ncan on these issues now. Whatever conclusion we reach,\nour opinion will help the political branches and the courts\ndischarge their responsibilities over detainee cases, and\nwill spare detainees and the Government years of unnec\nessary litigation. These considerations alone justify re\nview. That petitioner was convicted in federal court\n(rather than in a military commission) in criminal pro\nceedings uncomplicated by classified information or issues\nrelating to extraterritorial detention is an additional\nreason to grant certiorari. It is our duty to say what the\nlaw is on important matters within our jurisdiction. That\nis what we should do.\n                              I\n  Petitioner General Manuel Noriega is the former head of\nthe Panamanian Defense Forces. In 1988, a federal grand\njury indicted Noriega, and the U. S. military thereafter\nbrought him to Florida. A federal jury convicted him of\nvarious federal narcotics-related offenses, and the District\nCourt sentenced him to a 30-year prison term.

See\nUnited States v. Noriega, 808 F. Supp. 791 (SD Fla.,\n1992).2 Noriega\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed\nin proceedings not relevant here. See United States v.\nNoriega, 117 F. 3d 1206 (CA11 1997), cert. denied, 523\nU. S. 1060 (1998).\n  In July 2007, two months before Noriega was scheduled\nto be released on parole, he filed a habeas corpus petition\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255. Relying on the District Court\u2019s\nPOW designation, Noriega alleged that the United States\nviolated the Geneva Conventions when it acquiesced in\nthe French Government\u2019s request to extradite him to\nFrance so he could face criminal charges there upon his\nrelease from U. S. custody. See United States v. Noriega,\nNo. 88\u22120079\u2212CR, 2007 WL 2947572 (SD Fla., Aug. 24,\n2007).

S.\ncourt for violation of its provisions,\u201d the District Court addressed\nNoriega\u2019s status under the treaty. United States v. Noriega, 808\nF. Supp., at 794. The District Judge found that the hostilities in\nPanama constituted an \u201c \u2018armed conflict\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of Article\n2 of the Third Geneva Convention, that Noriega was a member of the\narmed forces of a party to the conflict under Article 4 of the Third\nConvention, and that the District Court was a \u201c \u2018competent tribunal\u2019 \u201d to\ndetermine Noriega\u2019s POW status under Article 5 of the Third Conven\ntion. See id., at 793\u2013796. Accordingly, the court concluded that,\nnotwithstanding various separation-of-powers and justiciability con\ncerns, \u201cNoriega is in fact a prisoner of war as defined by Geneva III,\nand as such must be afforded the protections established by the treaty\u201d\nwhile in federal custody. Id., at 796. The court then identified Conven\ntion rights that it believed would govern Noriega\u2019s confinement, see id.,\nat 799\u2013803, and observed that \u201c[w]hether or not those rights can be\nfully provided in a maximum security penitentiary setting is open to\nserious question,\u201d id., at 803.\n4                      NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nPOW status entitled him to the Conventions\u2019 protection\nuntil his \u201c final release and repatriation,\u201d but dismissed\nhis \u00a72255 petition on the ground that his extradition\nchallenge was not directed to \u201cany defect in [his] sen\ntence,\u201d and thus was not cognizable under \u00a72255. Id., at\n*1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nNoriega then filed the same claims under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72241, and the District Court ultimately3 stayed his ex\ntradition pending appeal on the ground that his challenge\nrested on \u201ccredible arguments . . ., particularly with re\ngard to the interpretation of certain provisions of the\nGeneva Convention[s],\u201d on which \u201cno other federal court\nhas ruled.\u201d No. 07\u2212CV\u221222816\u2212PCH, 2008 WL 331394, *3\n(SD Fla., Jan. 31, 2008).\n   On appeal, Noriega argued that his extradition to\nFrance would violate several provisions of the Third Con\nvention and that the District Court erred in concluding\notherwise. In response, the Government asserted that the\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over Noriega\u2019s claims because\n\u00a75(a) of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA)\nestablishes that \u201c[t]he Geneva Conventions are not self\nexecuting\u201d or judicially enforceable in habeas corpus ac\ntions.

See\nUnited States v. Noriega, No. 88\u22120079\u2212CR, 2007 WL 2947981, *1 (SD\nFla., Sept. 7, 2007) (dismissing the petition without prejudice but\nreiterating the merits concerns with Noriega\u2019s Geneva Convention\nclaims that the court articulated in dicta in dismissing his \u00a72255\npetition).\n  4 The Government also challenged Noriega\u2019s claims as meritless and\n\noutside the scope of habeas review under Circuit precedent.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Texas, 552 U.

The 2009 amendments\nprincipally update provisions relevant to the Guantanamo habeas\ncorpus cases pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of\nColumbia and clarify the due process protections available in those and\nother noncitizen detainee cases to which the constitutional and treaty\nissues in this case relate. See ibid.; see also J. Elsea, CRS Report for\nCongress, Comparison of Rights in Military Commission Trials and\nTrials in Federal Criminal Court, 2\u20134 (Nov. 19, 2009).\n   6 Although the Government distinguishes MCA \u00a75(a) from the juris\n\ndiction-stripping provision the Court invalidated in Boumediene, it\nstops short of asserting that \u00a75(a) is constitutional. See Brief in Oppo\nsition 8, n.\n6                     NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  The Eleventh Circuit accepted the District Court\u2019s des\nignation of Noriega as a POW, but agreed with the Gov\nernment\u2019s interpretation of MCA \u00a75(a):\n     \u201cWe affirm and hold that \u00a75 of the Military Commis\n     sions Act of 2006 precludes Noriega from invoking\n     the Geneva Convention as a source of rights in a ha\n     beas proceeding and therefore deny Noriega\u2019s habeas\n     petition.\n    .             .            .           .            .\n     \u201cThe issues present in Boumediene v. Bush concerning\n     the constitutionality of \u00a77 of the MCA, are not pre\n     sented by \u00a75 . . . . In Boumediene, the Supreme Court\n     found \u00a77 of the MCA, which explicitly removed the ju\n     risdiction of courts to consider habeas actions by en\n     emy combatants, to be unconstitutional . . . . Section\n     5, in contrast, as discussed more fully, infra, at most\n     changes one substantive provision of law upon which\n     a party might rely in seeking habeas relief. We are\n     [thus] not presented with a situation in which poten\n     tial petitioners are effectively banned from seeking\n     habeas relief because any constitutional rights\n     or claims are made unavailable. 564 F. 3d 1290,\n     1292, 1294 (CA11 2009) (citations and parenthetical\n     omitted).\u201d7\n   Noriega\u2019s petition challenges both the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of MCA \u00a75(a) and the provision\u2019s constitu\ntionality. Noriega begins by asserting that the Court of\nAppeals erred in holding \u201cthat [MCA \u00a75(a)] absolutely and\nunambiguously prohibits persons from raising any claim\nbased upon the four Geneva Conventions\u201d in a habeas\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court of Appeals also concluded that, \u201cassuming arguendo\u201d\n\nNoriega is correct that \u201c\u00a75 of the MCA does not preclude [his] claim,\u201d\nNoriega, 564 F. 3d, at 1297, the Third Geneva Convention does not bar\nhis extradition to France and the \u201cUnited States has fully complied\nwith\u201d the treaty, id., at 1298.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncorpus action. Pet. for Cert. 10; see also id., at 12 (\u201cAt\nbest, the statutory scheme is ambiguous\u201d). Noriega next\nasserts that, if the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a75(a) is correct, the provision violates the Supremacy\nClause, see id., at 11\u221212, and the Suspension Clause, see\nReply to Brief in Opposition 2. Noriega\u2019s Supremacy\nClause argument is that, to the extent MCA \u00a75(a) governs\nhis Geneva Convention claims, the provision impermissi\nbly effects a \u201ccomplete repudiation\u201d of the treaty. Pet. for\nCert. 11. The Government responds that this argument\nsuffers from two fatal flaws. First, this Court has held\nthat a treaty, which is \u201c \u2018primarily a compact between\nindependent nations,\u2019 \u201d remains in force as the supreme\nlaw of the land even where its enforcement is left to \u201cin\nternational negotiations\u201d rather than \u201cdomestic courts.\u201d\nBrief in Opposition 7 (quoting Head Money Cases, 112\nU. S. 580, 598 (1884)); see Medell\u00edn, supra, at 505, and\nn. 3. Second, \u201c[w]hatever the domestic effect of the Third\nGeneva Convention before the enactment of the MCA,\u201d\nthis Court has held that \u2018it is within Congress\u2019 power to\nchange domestic law, even if the law originally arose from\na self-executing treaty.\u2019 \u201d Brief in Opposition 7 (quoting\nNoriega, supra, at 1295\u20131296); see also Medell\u00edn, supra, at\n509, n. 5. Accordingly, the Government agrees with the\nEleventh Circuit that MCA \u00a75(a) \u201cdoes not change the\ninternational obligations of the United States under the\nGeneva Conventions,\u201d but does \u201csupersed[e] whatever\ndomestic effect the Geneva Conventions may have had in\nactions such as this.\u201d Brief in Opposition 7\u20138 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).         That brings\nNoriega to his Suspension Clause argument. He replies\nthat, if MCA \u00a75(a) operates in the manner the Govern\nment describes and the Eleventh Circuit held, the provi\nsion is unconstitutional under Boumediene because it\n\u201ceffectively works a suspension of the writ.\u201d Reply to Brief\nin Opposition 2 (asserting that \u201cto divorce the writ from\n8                   NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law is to destroy the writ\u201d).\n                              II\n   As the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion makes clear, the\nthreshold question in this case is whether MCA \u00a75(a) is\nvalid. Answering that question this Term would provide\ncourts and the political branches with much needed guid\nance on issues we left open in Boumediene. See Boumedi\u00ad\nene, 553 U. S, at ___, ___ (slip op. at 64\u221266, 68\u221270). Pro\nviding that guidance in this case would allow us to say\nwhat the law is without the unnecessary delay and other\ncomplications that could burden a decision on these ques\ntions in Guantanamo or other detainee litigation arising\nout of the conflict with Al Qaeda.\n   Boumediene invalidated MCA \u00a77\u2019s attempt to strip\nfederal courts of habeas jurisdiction over claims by a\nspecified class of non-citizen detainees (\u201cunlawful enemy\ncombatants\u201d), but did not determine the \u201ccontent of the\nlaw that governs petitioners\u2019 detention,\u201d id., at ___ (slip\nop. at 69), or the extent to which \u00a72241\u2019s substantive\nprovisions affect the constitutional \u201cprocedural protections\nof habeas corpus,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op. at 70). Section 2241\nbroadly confers jurisdiction over a habeas corpus action by\nany person who claims to be held \u201cin custody in violation\nof the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\u201d See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004).\nMCA \u00a75(a) eliminates the Geneva Conventions as a source\nof rights upon which \u00a72241 petitioners may rely in chal\nlenging their detentions. Statutory amendments to an\nexisting law ordinarily involve nothing more than a valid\nexercise of Congress\u2019 Article I authority. See, e.g., Chew\nHeong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 562\u2013563 (1884).\nNoriega asserts that the difference in this case is that the\nstatutory amendment narrows the scope of \u00a72241.

Only we can\ndetermine whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly rejected\nthat argument.\n   The Suspension Clause provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless\nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety\nmay require it.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2. Because the\nClause addresses only the suspension\u2014not the content or\nexistence\u2014of the \u201cPrivilege of the Writ,\u201d ibid., we have\nlong recognized the \u201cobligation\u201d the first Congress \u201cmust\nhave felt\u201d to \u201cprovid[e] efficient means by which this great\nconstitutional privilege should receive life and activity.\u201d\nEx parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 95 (1807). But we have\nalso steadfastly declined to adopt a date of reference by\nwhich the writ\u2019s constitutional content, if any, is to be\njudged, see Boumediene, supra, ___ (slip op. at 15\u221217), and\nthus have left open the question whether statutory efforts\nto limit \u00a72241 implicate the Suspension Clause, see, e.g.,\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300\u2013301 (2001). This ques\ntion, which has already divided the Court in other con\ntexts, see ibid.,8 is clearly presented here.

The Eleventh Circuit, however, saw no\nconstitutional problem with the statute and upheld it as\nvalid and distinguishable from the provision deemed\nunconstitutional in Boumediene. See 564 F. 3d, at 1294.\n  Addressing Noriega\u2019s challenge to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndecision would resolve the important statutory and consti\ntutional questions here and would guide courts and the\npolitical branches in addressing the same and similar\nissues in other detainee cases.

Recent court\ndecisions, as well as recent Executive Branch court filings\nand policy determinations, specifically invoke the Geneva\nConventions as part of the law that governs detainee\ntreatment in the United States and abroad. For example,\nin September 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Columbia issued a redacted version of a classified\nmemorandum opinion in which it granted habeas corpus\nrelief in the oldest of the pending Guantanamo cases\nbecause the petitioner\u2019s indefinite detention was based\n\u201calmost exclusively\u201d on unreliable \u201cconfessions\u201d obtained\n\u201cusing abusive techniques that violated the Army Field\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Court concedes, the writ could not be suspended within the mean\ning of the Suspension Clause until Congress affirmatively provided for\nhabeas by statute, then surely Congress may subsequently alter what it\nhad initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Circuit decisions, one of which is\nnow pending before us, similarly implicate the importance\nof the Geneva Convention and MCA \u00a75(a) questions in this\ncase. In Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (2009) (Ki\u00ad\nyemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___, the petitioners, Guan\ntanamo detainees who prevailed on their habeas corpus\nclaims in federal court but cannot return to their home\ncountry, rely on the Geneva Conventions in claiming a\nright to be released in the territorial United States, see\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08\u20131234, pp. i, 34. Although the D. C.\nCircuit did not address MCA \u00a75(a) in rejecting this claim,\nthe Government contends before this Court that MCA\n\u00a75(a) bars petitioners\u2019 reliance on the Conventions, see\nBrief in Opposition in No. 08-1234, pp. 23\u201324, and Judge\nRogers\u2019 opinion concurring in the D. C. Circuit\u2019s judgment\nrelies upon the same repatriation language in Article 118\nof the Third Convention that Noriega raises here, see 555\nF. 3d, at 1033, n. 2. In Al-Bihani, supra, the D. C. Circuit\ndirectly invokes MCA \u00a75(a) in rejecting a Guantanamo\ndetainee\u2019s claim that he was entitled to habeas corpus\nrelief because his detention violated, inter alia, the Third\nGeneva Convention, see id., at *2\u20133; *6 (stating that MCA\n\u00a75(a), \u201ca provision not altered by the MCA of 2009, explic\nitly precludes detainees from claiming the Geneva Con\nventions\u2014which include criteria to determine who is\nentitled to P.O.W. status\u2014as a source of rights\u201d). Finally,\nthe D. C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Kiyemba v. Obama, 561\nF. 3d 509 (2009) (Kiyemba II), implicates the issues here\nin holding, contrary to several recent district court deci\nsions,9 that another MCA provision (MCA \u00a77(a)(2), codified\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 9 See   Khadr v.

See 561\nF. 3d, at 512\u2013513.\n   The extent to which noncitizen detainees may rely on\nthe Geneva Conventions as a source of rights against the\nUnited States has also been the subject of increasing\ndebate in the political branches. Recent Executive Branch\nOrders and court filings cite the Conventions in articulat\ning the legal standards that govern detainee treatment.\nSee, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13491, \u00a73, 74 Fed.

A deci\nsion upholding MCA \u00a75(a) would obviate the need for\ndetainees, the Government, and federal courts to struggle\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBay Naval Base (Dec. 15, 2009); Some Guantanamo Detainees to Move\nto Illinois Prison, Am.

Elsea, K. Thomas, & M. Garcia, CRS Report for Con\n\ngress, Enemy Combatant Detainees: Habeas Corpus Challenges in\nFederal Court, 36, 41-43 (2009).\n   12 Because the D. C. Circuit\u2019s majority opinion in Kiyemba I does not\n\naddress MCA \u00a75(a), the provision\u2019s validity is not squarely presented in\nthat case. See Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC 2009) (Ki\u00ad\nyemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___ (2009). And granting review of the\nD. C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Al-Bihani, which does address MCA \u00a75(a),\nwould not guarantee a decision on the statute\u2019s validity. See Al-Bihani\nv. Obama, No. 09\u22125051, 2010 WL 10411 (CADC 2010). Al-Bihani\naddresses MCA \u00a75(a) in rejecting only one of many claims for habeas\ncorpus relief, so it is not clear that the Court would need to address the\nstatute\u2019s validity in deciding the case. And even if the Court were to\naddress \u00a75(a), the decision would come next Term, thus providing no\nguidance to courts that must adjudicate pending habeas corpus actions\nthis spring and summer. In contrast, addressing MCA \u00a75(a)\u2019s validity\nin this case would timely provide such guidance. Doing so could also\naid our disposition of Kiyemba I because answering the questions\npresented here could clarify the constitutional scope of the writ of\nhabeas corpus in a manner that could affect the Kiyemba I petitioners\u2019\nargument about the inherent remedial power of habeas corpus courts.\nSee Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\u20131234, pp. 14\u201316, 22\u201323; see generally\nKiyemba I, 555 F. 3d, at 1026\u20131027; St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 335\u2013340\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n14                     NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(as they did here) with Geneva Convention claims in\nhabeas corpus proceedings.13 And, it would give the politi\ncal branches a clearer sense of the constitutional limits to\nwhich new legislative or policy initiatives must adhere.\nThe latter benefit would also follow if we were to invali\ndate MCA \u00a75(a). In addition, such a ruling could well\nallow us to reach the question we left open in Hamdan\u2014\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable\u2014because this case is not governed\nby the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions on\nwhich the Hamdan majority relied in holding Common\nArticle III applicable to the proceedings in that case. See\nHamdan, 548 U. S., at 627\u2013628; see also id., at 637, 642\u2013\n643 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). Finally, if the\nCourt were to conclude that the Conventions are self\nexecuting and judicially enforceable in habeas corpus\nproceedings, this case would present two additional ques\ntions relevant to noncitizen detainee litigation: whether\nfederal courts may classify such detainees as POWs under\nthe Third Convention, and whether any of the Conven\ntions requires the United States immediately to repatriate\ndetainees entitled to release from U. S. custody.14\n   Against these considerations, the Government pro\nvides no compelling reason to decline review.15 Accord\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 MCA \u00a75(a) applies not only to individuals who, like Noriega, have\n\n(rightly or not) been designated POWs, but also to \u201cany person\u201d who\ninvokes the Conventions as a source of rights in any \u201chabeas or other\ncivil action\u201d to which the United States is a party, see 120 Stat. 2631,\nnote following 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241.\n   14 Both questions are subsumed in the second question in the Solicitor\n\nGeneral\u2019s brief: \u201c[w]hether, assuming petitioner can assert a claim\nbased on the Geneva Convention, his extradition to France would\nviolate the Convention.\u201d Brief in Opposition i.\n   15 The Solicitor General\u2019s principal ground for opposing certiorari is\n\nthat the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision does not conflict with the decision\nof any other Circuit. See Brief in Opposition 6. That is true but not\nsurprising. The original version of the MCA is only three years old and,\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ningly, I would take the case and decide the questions\npresented in the Solicitor General\u2019s brief.16\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nas the Solicitor General is careful to note, Noriega is \u201cthe only person\ncurrently detained by the United States as a prisoner of war.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). Accordingly, the lack of a circuit split on the ques\ntion whether MCA \u00a75(a) bars POWs in federal custody in the United\nStates from invoking the Geneva Conventions in habeas proceedings\ndoes not negate the compelling reasons to grant review. Indeed, the\nCourt has taken cases in this area without the benefit of any opinion\nfrom a court of appeals, see Ex parte Quirin, supra, and in splitless\ncases involving rare facts and ongoing diplomatic negotiations, see\nKiyemba I, ante, p. ___. The Court has also granted review of separa\ntion-of-powers and other important legal questions on records far less\ndeveloped than that here, see, e.g., Robertson v. United States ex rel.\nWatson, ante, p. ___; Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal.\nHasting College of Law v. Martinez, ante, p. ___; on petitions that have\nrequired us to reformulate the questions presented, see, e.g., Robertson,\nsupra; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 555 U. S. ___ (2009); and even\non petitions we initially denied, see Boumediene v. Bush, 551 U. S. 1160\n(2007). The Solicitor General also claims (again based on the fact that\nNoriega is \u201ccurrently\u201d the only POW in U. S. custody) that review is not\nwarranted because the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision is of \u201climited ongoing\nsignificance.\u201d Ibid. This assertion is not persuasive for the reasons set\nforth above.\n   16 As noted, the Solicitor General\u2019s first question presented is whether\n\nMCA \u00a75(a) \u201cprecludes petitioner from invoking\u201d the Third Geneva\nConvention \u201cas a source of rights in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d Brief\nin Opposition i. Such statutory questions do not automatically, or even\ntypically, require a court to consider the statute\u2019s constitutionality.\nHere, however, Noriega has consistently argued that, if the statute\nprecludes him from invoking the Geneva Conventions in the manner\nthe Solicitor General\u2019s question describes and the Eleventh Circuit\nheld, the statute would violate the Suspension Clause. See supra, at\n6\u22127. Thus, the Suspension Clause issue may in this case fairly be\nviewed as implicit in the statutory question presented.\n",

The\nfirst is the extent, if any, to which provisions like Section 5\naffect 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241 in a manner that implicates the\nconstitutional guarantee of habeas corpus. The second is\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable.\n   It is incumbent upon us to provide what guidance we\ncan on these issues now. Whatever conclusion we reach,\nour opinion will help the political branches and the courts\ndischarge their responsibilities over detainee cases, and\nwill spare detainees and the Government years of unnec\nessary litigation. These considerations alone justify re\nview. That petitioner was convicted in federal court\n(rather than in a military commission) in criminal pro\nceedings uncomplicated by classified information or issues\nrelating to extraterritorial detention is an additional\nreason to grant certiorari.

In Boumediene, the Supreme Court\n     found \u00a77 of the MCA, which explicitly removed the ju\n     risdiction of courts to consider habeas actions by en\n     emy combatants, to be unconstitutional . . . . Section\n     5, in contrast, as discussed more fully, infra, at most\n     changes one substantive provision of law upon which\n     a party might rely in seeking habeas relief. We are\n     [thus] not presented with a situation in which poten\n     tial petitioners are effectively banned from seeking\n     habeas relief because any constitutional rights\n     or claims are made unavailable. 564 F. 3d 1290,\n     1292, 1294 (CA11 2009) (citations and parenthetical\n     omitted).\u201d7\n   Noriega\u2019s petition challenges both the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of MCA \u00a75(a) and the provision\u2019s constitu\ntionality. Noriega begins by asserting that the Court of\nAppeals erred in holding \u201cthat [MCA \u00a75(a)] absolutely and\nunambiguously prohibits persons from raising any claim\nbased upon the four Geneva Conventions\u201d in a habeas\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court of Appeals also concluded that, \u201cassuming arguendo\u201d\n\nNoriega is correct that \u201c\u00a75 of the MCA does not preclude [his] claim,\u201d\nNoriega, 564 F. 3d, at 1297, the Third Geneva Convention does not bar\nhis extradition to France and the \u201cUnited States has fully complied\nwith\u201d the treaty, id., at 1298.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Noriega next\nasserts that, if the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a75(a) is correct, the provision violates the Supremacy\nClause, see id., at 11\u221212, and the Suspension Clause, see\nReply to Brief in Opposition 2. Noriega\u2019s Supremacy\nClause argument is that, to the extent MCA \u00a75(a) governs\nhis Geneva Convention claims, the provision impermissi\nbly effects a \u201ccomplete repudiation\u201d of the treaty. Pet. for\nCert. 11. The Government responds that this argument\nsuffers from two fatal flaws. First, this Court has held\nthat a treaty, which is \u201c \u2018primarily a compact between\nindependent nations,\u2019 \u201d remains in force as the supreme\nlaw of the land even where its enforcement is left to \u201cin\nternational negotiations\u201d rather than \u201cdomestic courts.\u201d\nBrief in Opposition 7 (quoting Head Money Cases, 112\nU. S. 580, 598 (1884)); see Medell\u00edn, supra, at 505, and\nn. 3. Second, \u201c[w]hatever the domestic effect of the Third\nGeneva Convention before the enactment of the MCA,\u201d\nthis Court has held that \u2018it is within Congress\u2019 power to\nchange domestic law, even if the law originally arose from\na self-executing treaty.\u2019 \u201d Brief in Opposition 7 (quoting\nNoriega, supra, at 1295\u20131296); see also Medell\u00edn, supra, at\n509, n. 5. Accordingly, the Government agrees with the\nEleventh Circuit that MCA \u00a75(a) \u201cdoes not change the\ninternational obligations of the United States under the\nGeneva Conventions,\u201d but does \u201csupersed[e] whatever\ndomestic effect the Geneva Conventions may have had in\nactions such as this.\u201d Brief in Opposition 7\u20138 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).         That brings\nNoriega to his Suspension Clause argument. He replies\nthat, if MCA \u00a75(a) operates in the manner the Govern\nment describes and the Eleventh Circuit held, the provi\nsion is unconstitutional under Boumediene because it\n\u201ceffectively works a suspension of the writ.\u201d Reply to Brief\nin Opposition 2 (asserting that \u201cto divorce the writ from\n8                   NORIEGA v.

Answering that question this Term would provide\ncourts and the political branches with much needed guid\nance on issues we left open in Boumediene. See Boumedi\u00ad\nene, 553 U. S, at ___, ___ (slip op. at 64\u221266, 68\u221270). Pro\nviding that guidance in this case would allow us to say\nwhat the law is without the unnecessary delay and other\ncomplications that could burden a decision on these ques\ntions in Guantanamo or other detainee litigation arising\nout of the conflict with Al Qaeda.\n   Boumediene invalidated MCA \u00a77\u2019s attempt to strip\nfederal courts of habeas jurisdiction over claims by a\nspecified class of non-citizen detainees (\u201cunlawful enemy\ncombatants\u201d), but did not determine the \u201ccontent of the\nlaw that governs petitioners\u2019 detention,\u201d id., at ___ (slip\nop. at 69), or the extent to which \u00a72241\u2019s substantive\nprovisions affect the constitutional \u201cprocedural protections\nof habeas corpus,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op. at 70). Section 2241\nbroadly confers jurisdiction over a habeas corpus action by\nany person who claims to be held \u201cin custody in violation\nof the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\u201d See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004).\nMCA \u00a75(a) eliminates the Geneva Conventions as a source\nof rights upon which \u00a72241 petitioners may rely in chal\nlenging their detentions. Statutory amendments to an\nexisting law ordinarily involve nothing more than a valid\nexercise of Congress\u2019 Article I authority. See, e.g., Chew\nHeong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 562\u2013563 (1884).\nNoriega asserts that the difference in this case is that the\nstatutory amendment narrows the scope of \u00a72241.

Only we can\ndetermine whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly rejected\nthat argument.\n   The Suspension Clause provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless\nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety\nmay require it.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 2. Because the\nClause addresses only the suspension\u2014not the content or\nexistence\u2014of the \u201cPrivilege of the Writ,\u201d ibid., we have\nlong recognized the \u201cobligation\u201d the first Congress \u201cmust\nhave felt\u201d to \u201cprovid[e] efficient means by which this great\nconstitutional privilege should receive life and activity.\u201d\nEx parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 95 (1807). But we have\nalso steadfastly declined to adopt a date of reference by\nwhich the writ\u2019s constitutional content, if any, is to be\njudged, see Boumediene, supra, ___ (slip op. at 15\u221217), and\nthus have left open the question whether statutory efforts\nto limit \u00a72241 implicate the Suspension Clause, see, e.g.,\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300\u2013301 (2001). This ques\ntion, which has already divided the Court in other con\ntexts, see ibid.,8 is clearly presented here.

The Eleventh Circuit, however, saw no\nconstitutional problem with the statute and upheld it as\nvalid and distinguishable from the provision deemed\nunconstitutional in Boumediene. See 564 F. 3d, at 1294.\n  Addressing Noriega\u2019s challenge to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndecision would resolve the important statutory and consti\ntutional questions here and would guide courts and the\npolitical branches in addressing the same and similar\nissues in other detainee cases.

Recent court\ndecisions, as well as recent Executive Branch court filings\nand policy determinations, specifically invoke the Geneva\nConventions as part of the law that governs detainee\ntreatment in the United States and abroad. For example,\nin September 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Columbia issued a redacted version of a classified\nmemorandum opinion in which it granted habeas corpus\nrelief in the oldest of the pending Guantanamo cases\nbecause the petitioner\u2019s indefinite detention was based\n\u201calmost exclusively\u201d on unreliable \u201cconfessions\u201d obtained\n\u201cusing abusive techniques that violated the Army Field\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Court concedes, the writ could not be suspended within the mean\ning of the Suspension Clause until Congress affirmatively provided for\nhabeas by statute, then surely Congress may subsequently alter what it\nhad initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Although the D.

C. Circuit\u2019s judgment\nrelies upon the same repatriation language in Article 118\nof the Third Convention that Noriega raises here, see 555\nF. 3d, at 1033, n. 2. In Al-Bihani, supra, the D. C. Circuit\ndirectly invokes MCA \u00a75(a) in rejecting a Guantanamo\ndetainee\u2019s claim that he was entitled to habeas corpus\nrelief because his detention violated, inter alia, the Third\nGeneva Convention, see id., at *2\u20133; *6 (stating that MCA\n\u00a75(a), \u201ca provision not altered by the MCA of 2009, explic\nitly precludes detainees from claiming the Geneva Con\nventions\u2014which include criteria to determine who is\nentitled to P.O.W. status\u2014as a source of rights\u201d).

S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat would further clarify the extent to which detainees\ncan enforce Geneva Convention obligations against the\nUnited States in federal courts, but progress on these\nproposals has been complicated by uncertainty over the\nstatutory and constitutional questions in this case.11\n  As noted, addressing these questions now,12 if only the\nstatutory issues, would avoid years of litigation and uncer\ntainty no matter what we conclude on the merits. A deci\nsion upholding MCA \u00a75(a) would obviate the need for\ndetainees, the Government, and federal courts to struggle\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBay Naval Base (Dec. 15, 2009); Some Guantanamo Detainees to Move\nto Illinois Prison, Am. Forces Press Serv. (Dec. 15, 2009); Letter to Pat\nQuirin, Governor of Illinois, from the Attorney General, the Secretaries\nof State, Defense, and Homeland Security, and the Director of National\nIntelligence, at 2 (Dec. 15, 2009) (all sources available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).\n   11 See, e.g., J. Elsea, K. Thomas, & M. Garcia, CRS Report for Con\n\ngress, Enemy Combatant Detainees: Habeas Corpus Challenges in\nFederal Court, 36, 41-43 (2009).\n   12 Because the D. C. Circuit\u2019s majority opinion in Kiyemba I does not\n\naddress MCA \u00a75(a), the provision\u2019s validity is not squarely presented in\nthat case. See Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC 2009) (Ki\u00ad\nyemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___ (2009). And granting review of the\nD. C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Al-Bihani, which does address MCA \u00a75(a),\nwould not guarantee a decision on the statute\u2019s validity. See Al-Bihani\nv. Obama, No. 09\u22125051, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187514\"><a href=\"/opinion/187514/al-bihani-v-obama/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">10411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CADC 2010). Al-Bihani\naddresses MCA \u00a75(a) in rejecting only one of many claims for habeas\ncorpus relief, so it is not clear that the Court would need to address the\nstatute\u2019s validity in deciding the case. And even if the Court were to\naddress \u00a75(a), the decision would come next Term, thus providing no\nguidance to courts that must adjudicate pending habeas corpus actions\nthis spring and summer. In contrast, addressing MCA \u00a75(a)\u2019s validity\nin this case would timely provide such guidance. Doing so could also\naid our disposition of Kiyemba I because answering the questions\npresented here could clarify the constitutional scope of the writ of\nhabeas corpus in a manner that could affect the Kiyemba I petitioners\u2019\nargument about the inherent remedial power of habeas corpus courts.\nSee Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\u20131234, pp. 14\u201316, 22\u201323; see generally\nKiyemba I, 555 F. 3d, at 1026\u20131027; St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 335\u2013340\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n14                     NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(as they did here) with Geneva Convention claims in\nhabeas corpus proceedings.13 And, it would give the politi\ncal branches a clearer sense of the constitutional limits to\nwhich new legislative or policy initiatives must adhere.\nThe latter benefit would also follow if we were to invali\ndate MCA \u00a75(a). In addition, such a ruling could well\nallow us to reach the question we left open in Hamdan\u2014\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable\u2014because this case is not governed\nby the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions on\nwhich the Hamdan majority relied in holding Common\nArticle III applicable to the proceedings in that case. See\nHamdan, 548 U. S., at 627\u2013628; see also id., at 637, 642\u2013\n643 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). Finally, if the\nCourt were to conclude that the Conventions are self\nexecuting and judicially enforceable in habeas corpus\nproceedings, this case would present two additional ques\ntions relevant to noncitizen detainee litigation: whether\nfederal courts may classify such detainees as POWs under\nthe Third Convention, and whether any of the Conven\ntions requires the United States immediately to repatriate\ndetainees entitled to release from U. S. custody.14\n   Against these considerations, the Government pro\nvides no compelling reason to decline review.15 Accord\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 MCA \u00a75(a) applies not only to individuals who, like Noriega, have\n\n(rightly or not) been designated POWs, but also to \u201cany person\u201d who\ninvokes the Conventions as a source of rights in any \u201chabeas or other\ncivil action\u201d to which the United States is a party, see 120 Stat. 2631,\nnote following 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241.\n   14 Both questions are subsumed in the second question in the Solicitor\n\nGeneral\u2019s brief: \u201c[w]hether, assuming petitioner can assert a claim\nbased on the Geneva Convention, his extradition to France would\nviolate the Convention.\u201d Brief in Opposition i.\n   15 The Solicitor General\u2019s principal ground for opposing certiorari is\n\nthat the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision does not conflict with the decision\nof any other Circuit. See Brief in Opposition 6. That is true but not\nsurprising. The original version of the MCA is only three years old and,\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ningly, I would take the case and decide the questions\npresented in the Solicitor General\u2019s brief.16\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nas the Solicitor General is careful to note, Noriega is \u201cthe only person\ncurrently detained by the United States as a prisoner of war.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). Accordingly, the lack of a circuit split on the ques\ntion whether MCA \u00a75(a) bars POWs in federal custody in the United\nStates from invoking the Geneva Conventions in habeas proceedings\ndoes not negate the compelling reasons to grant review. Indeed, the\nCourt has taken cases in this area without the benefit of any opinion\nfrom a court of appeals, see Ex parte Quirin, supra, and in splitless\ncases involving rare facts and ongoing diplomatic negotiations, see\nKiyemba I, ante, p. ___. The Court has also granted review of separa\ntion-of-powers and other important legal questions on records far less\ndeveloped than that here, see, e.g., Robertson v. United States ex rel.\nWatson, ante, p. ___; Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal.\nHasting College of Law v. Martinez, ante, p. ___; on petitions that have\nrequired us to reformulate the questions presented, see, e.g., Robertson,\nsupra; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 555 U. S. ___ (2009); and even\non petitions we initially denied, see Boumediene v. Bush, 551 U. S. 1160\n(2007). The Solicitor General also claims (again based on the fact that\nNoriega is \u201ccurrently\u201d the only POW in U. S. custody) that review is not\nwarranted because the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision is of \u201climited ongoing\nsignificance.\u201d Ibid. This assertion is not persuasive for the reasons set\nforth above.\n   16 As noted, the Solicitor General\u2019s first question presented is whether\n\nMCA \u00a75(a) \u201cprecludes petitioner from invoking\u201d the Third Geneva\nConvention \u201cas a source of rights in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d Brief\nin Opposition i. Such statutory questions do not automatically, or even\ntypically, require a court to consider the statute\u2019s constitutionality.\nHere, however, Noriega has consistently argued that, if the statute\nprecludes him from invoking the Geneva Conventions in the manner\nthe Solicitor General\u2019s question describes and the Eleventh Circuit\nheld, the statute would violate the Suspension Clause. See supra, at\n6\u22127. Thus, the Suspension Clause issue may in this case fairly be\nviewed as implicit in the statutory question presented.\n</pre>",
