FROMMERT ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u2013810.      Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided April 21, 2010\nPetitioners are Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan\u2019s\n  current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon\n  dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980\u2019s, received lump-sum\n  distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were\n  later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating\n  respondents\u2019 current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter\n  preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as\n  the \u201cphantom account\u201d method. Respondents challenged that method\n  in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n  1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for\n  the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that\n  the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable and that\n  respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac\n  count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,\n  the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan\n  that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre\n  viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential\n  standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach\n  proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of\n  money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the\n  District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re\n  mand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on the merits was not an\n  abuse of discretion.\nHeld: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of\n review to the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\n mand. Pp. 4\u201315.\n    (a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions\n of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n2                      CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for\n    guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de\n    pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a\n    trust instrument gives the trustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or\n    doubtful terms, . . . the trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed\n    if reasonable.\u201d Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan\u2019s terms, the Plan\n    Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in\n    terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex\n    ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a\n    deferential standard when a plan administrator\u2019s previous construc\n    tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach has\n    no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference\n    with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This\n    Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,\n    that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in\n    terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of\n    that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should\n    require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit\u2019s decision sup\n    ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were\n    based\u2014the plan\u2019s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA\u2019s purposes.\n    The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author\n    ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to\n    construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re\n    quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA\n    but do not \u201ctell the entire story.\u201d Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,\n    497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts\n    may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good\n    faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.\n       ERISA represents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\n    prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of\n    the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.\n    200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this \u201ccareful balancing\u201d and\n    protects the statute\u2019s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni\n    formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a\n    plan administrator\u2019s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but\n    the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud\n    denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus\n    trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def\n    erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more\n    complicated than necessary. Respondents\u2019 approach threatens to in\n    terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that \u201cwould create fur\n    ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al\n    ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.\u201d Glenn, supra, at ___.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform\n  ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone\n  deference. The District Court\u2019s interpretation does not account for\n  the time value of money, but respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testi\n  fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents\n  do not dispute that the District Court\u2019s approach would place them in\n  a better position than employees who never left the company. If\n  other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of\n  money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in\n  which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations\n  in different States. Pp. 5\u201313.\n     (c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea\n  sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference\n  each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis\n  putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from\n  challenging administrators\u2019 decisions. These concerns are overblown\n  because there is no reason to think that deference would be required\n  in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er\n  roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in\n  good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too\n  incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds\n  of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential\n  standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator\n  will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin\n  istrator\u2019s interpretation \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Fire\n  stone, 489 U. S., at 111. The lower courts should have applied the\n  standard established in Firestone and Glenn. Pp. 13\u201314.\n535 F. 3d 111, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

Even administrators of ERISA\nplans. That should come as no surprise, given that the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is \u201can\nenormously complex and detailed statute,\u201d Mertens v.\nHewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 262 (1993), and the plans\nthat administrators must construe can be lengthy and\ncomplicated. (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with\n139 sections.) We held in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nBruch, 489 U. S. 101 (1989), that an ERISA plan adminis\ntrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is\nentitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The\nquestion here is whether a single honest mistake in plan\ninterpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that\ndeference for subsequent related interpretations of the\nplan. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are\nexceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual\ndetails are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we\n2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns\nXerox Corporation\u2019s pension plan, which is covered by\nERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et seq.\nPetitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the\nPlan\u2019s current and former administrators (hereinafter\nPlan Administrator). See \u00a71002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re\nspondents are Xerox employees who left the company in\nthe 1980\u2019s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement\nbenefits they had earned up to that point, and were later\nrehired. See 328 F. Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief\nfor Respondents 9\u201310. The dispute giving rise to this case\nconcerns how to account for respondents\u2019 past distribu\ntions when calculating their current benefits\u2014that is, how\nto avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.\n   The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to\ncall for an approach that has come to be known as the\n\u201cphantom account\u201d method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.\nEssentially, that method calculated the hypothetical\ngrowth that respondents\u2019 past distributions would have\nexperienced if the money had remained in Xerox\u2019s invest\nment funds, and reduced respondents\u2019 present benefits\naccordingly. See id., at 426\u2013428; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents\u2019\nadministrative challenges to that method, respondents\nfiled suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428\u2013429. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,\napplying a deferential standard of review to the Plan\nAdministrator\u2019s interpretation. See id., at 430\u2013431, 439.\nThe Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that\nthe Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable\nand that respondents had not been adequately notified\nthat the phantom account method would be used to calcu\nlate their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265\u2013269\n(2006).\n   The phantom account method having been exorcised\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Plan, the District Court on remand considered\nother approaches for adjusting respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.\n2d 452, 456\u2013458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator\nsubmitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like\nthe phantom account method, accounted for the time value\nof the money that respondents had previously received.\nBut unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin\nistrator\u2019s new approach did not calculate the present value\nof a past distribution based on events that occurred after\nthe distribution was made. Instead, the new approach\nused an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the\ndistribution, thereby calculating the current value of the\ndistribution based on information that was known at the\ntime of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a\u2013\n153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should\napply a deferential standard of review to this approach,\nand accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.\nSee Defendants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies\nin No. 00\u2013CV\u20136311 (WDNY), pp. 7\u20138; Defendants\u2019 Pre-\nHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00\u2013CV\u2013\n6311 (WDNY), p. 2.\n   The District Court did not apply a deferential standard\nof review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am\nbiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed\nby respondents that did not account for the time value of\nmoney. Under that approach, respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past\ndistributions\u2014thereby treating a dollar distributed to\nrespondents in the 1980\u2019s as equal in value to a dollar\ndistributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457\u2013458. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the\nDistrict Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan\ndard on remand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on\nthe merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n111, 119 (2008).\n   Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques\ntions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\nmand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly\ngranted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.\n                              II\n                               A\n   This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the\ndecisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489\nU. S. 101. Because ERISA\u2019s text does not directly resolve\nthe matter, we looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for guid\nance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust\nlaw, the proper standard of review of a trustee\u2019s decision\ndepends on the language of the instrument creating the\ntrust. See id., at 111\u2013112. If the trust documents give the\ntrustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .\nthe trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason\nable.\u201d Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held\nthat \u201ca denial of benefits challenged under \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\nis to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre\ntionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\nconstrue the terms of the plan.\u201d Id., at 115.\n   We expanded Firestone\u2019s approach in Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the\nproper standard of review when a plan administrator\noperates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to\ntrust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles\nof ERISA\u2014plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6\u20137, 9\u201310). We held that,\nwhen the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to\nthe plan administrator, a deferential standard of review\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nremains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of\nthe Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be\nentitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328\nF. Supp. 2d, at 430\u2013431 (observing that the Plan grants\nthe Plan Administrator \u201cbroad discretion in making deci\nsions relative to the Plan\u201d). The Court of Appeals, how\never, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi\ncally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a\ndeferential standard \u201cwhere the administrator ha[s] previ\nously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such\na construction to have violated ERISA.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 119.\nUnder that view, the District Court here was entitled to\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by\nthe Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap\npeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.       Cf. ibid. (accepting the District\nCourt\u2019s chosen method as one of \u201cseveral reasonable\nalternatives\u201d).\n                               B\n  We reject this \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach.\nBrief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no\nbasis in the Court\u2019s holding in Firestone, which set out a\nbroad standard of deference without any suggestion that\nthe standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the\none adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at\n111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception\nto Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA\nlaw was already complicated enough without adding\n\u201cspecial procedural or evidentiary rules\u201d to the mix. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a\nsystemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis\ntrator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi\ncult to see why a single honest mistake would require a\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent result.\n  Nor is the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision supported by the\nconsiderations on which our holdings in Firestone and\nGlenn were based\u2014namely, the terms of the plan, princi\nples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,\nat 4\u20135. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator\ngeneral authority to \u201c[c]onstrue the Plan.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 141a\u2013142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that\nthe grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe\nthe Plan.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019 exception to Firestone\ndeference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust\nlaw is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading\ntreatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis\ncretion when there is reason to believe that he will not\nexercise that discretion fairly\u2014for example, upon a show\ning that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:\n    \u201cIf the trustee\u2019s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to\n    the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer\n    cise [the trustee\u2019s] discretion honestly and fairly, the\n    court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On\n    the other hand, if the trustee\u2019s failure to provide rea\n    sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to\n    the trustee\u2019s duties or powers, and there is no reason\n    to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis\n    cretion once the court has determined the extent of\n    the trustee\u2019s duties and powers, the court ordinarily\n    will not fix the amount but will instead direct the\n    trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici\n    ary\u2019s support.\u201d 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher,\n    Scott and Ascher on Trusts \u00a718.2.1, pp. 1348\u20131349\n    (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote\n    omitted) (citing cases).\nThis is not surprising\u2014if the settlor who creates a trust\ngrants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsettlor would want the trustee divested entirely of that\ndiscretion simply because of one good-faith mistake.1\n  Here the lower courts made no finding that the Plan\nAdministrator had acted in bad faith or would not fairly\nexercise his discretion to interpret the terms of the Plan.\nThus, if the District Court had followed the trust law\nprinciples set out in Scott and Ascher, it should not have\n\u201cact[ed] as a substitute trustee,\u201d Eaton v.

Another treatise states that, after a\ntrustee has abused his discretion, \u201c[s]ometimes the court\ndecides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating\nthe exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some\nlimits on the trustee\u2019s action and giving him leeway within\nthose limits.\u201d G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and\nTrustees \u00a7560, p. 223 (2d rev. ed. 1980).\n  The unclear state of trust law on the question was per\nhaps best captured by the Texas Supreme Court:\n    \u201cThere is authority for ordering a dismissal of the case\n    to afford the trustee an opportunity to exercise a rea\n    sonable discretion in arriving at the amount of pay\n    ments to be made in the light of our discussion of the\n    problem and after a proper consideration of the many\n    factors involved. On the other hand, there is author\n    ity for remanding the case to the trial court to hear\n    evidence and in the exercise of its supervisory juris\n    diction to fix the amount of such payments. There is\n    still other authority for remanding the case to the\n    trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a\n    reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee\n    within maximum and minimum limits.\u201d State v.\n    Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 54\u201355, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)\n    (citations omitted).\n  While we are \u201cguided by principles of trust law\u201d in\nERISA cases, Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111, we have recog\nnized before that \u201ctrust law does not tell the entire story,\u201d\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996); see ibid.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cIn some instances, trust law will offer only a starting\npoint, after which courts must go on to ask whether, or to\nwhat extent, the language of the statute, its structure, or\nits purposes require departing from common-law trust\nrequirements\u201d); Brief for Respondents 50 (pressing same\nview as the dissent but concluding that the dispute over\ntrust law \u201cneed not be resolved\u201d). Here trust law does not\nresolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi\nples we have identified underlying ERISA do.\n   Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees\nwould receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress\ndid not require employers to establish benefit plans in the\nfirst place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887\n(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre\nsents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health\nInc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life\nIns. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress\nsought \u201cto create a system that is [not] so complex that\nadministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis\ncourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first\nplace.\u201d Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA \u201cinduc[es]\nemployers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of\nliabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\nand a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and\nawards when a violation has occurred.\u201d Rush Prudential\nHMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 379 (2002).\n   Firestone deference protects these interests and, by\npermitting an employer to grant primary interpretive\nauthority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator,\npreserves the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d on which ERISA is\nbased. Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging\nresolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis\ntrative proceedings rather than costly litigation. It also\npromotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpertise of the plan administrator rather than worry\nabout unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that\nmight result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,\nFirestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,\nhelping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of\na plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ\nent jurisdictions\u2014a result that \u201cwould introduce consider\nable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which\nmight lead those employers with existing plans to reduce\nbenefits, and those without such plans to refrain from\nadopting them.\u201d Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\nU. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries\ntells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an\nERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by\nfederal law, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is\ninterpreted to mean different things in different places.\nSee Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5\u201311.\n   Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do\nnot question that deference to plan administrators serves\nthese important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer\nence is less important once a plan administrator has is\nsued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.\nBut the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform\nity\u2014and the manner in which they are promoted by defer\nence to reasonable plan construction by administrators\u2014\ndo not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis\ntrator has made a single honest mistake.\n   This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter\nest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by\ngranting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the\nPlan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis\ntrict Court had applied a deferential standard of review\nunder Firestone, the question before it would have been\nwhether the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the\nPlan was reasonable. After answering that question, the\ncase might well have been over. Instead, the District\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the\nmore complicated question of how best to interpret the\nPlan.\n   The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in\nrespondents\u2019 approach does not end there. Under respon\ndents\u2019 and the Government\u2019s view, the question whether a\ndeferential standard of review was required in this case\nturns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting\nthe \u201csame terms\u201d or deciding the \u201csame issue\u201d on remand.\nSee Brief for Respondents 43, 46\u201348, 53, and n. 13; Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 13\u201315, 23. Whether\nthat condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,\npetitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the\nPlan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on\nremand\u2014how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific\nprovisions requiring use of the phantom account method\ncould not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 50\u201351. Respondents would force\nthe parties to litigate this potentially complicated \u201csame\nissue\u201d or \u201csame terms\u201d question before a district court\ncould even decide whether deference is owed to a plan\nadministrator\u2019s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is\nlittle place in the ERISA context for these sorts of \u201cspecial\nprocedural rules [that] would create further complexity,\nadding time and expense to a process that may already be\ntoo costly for many of those who seek redress.\u201d 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   The position of respondents and the Government could\ninterject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For\nexample, even under their view, the District Court here\ncould have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;\nthe court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for\nRespondents 43, 49\u201350, 52\u201353; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23\u201324. That raises the question of how a\ncourt is to decide between the two options; respondents\u2019\nanswer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,\n12               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40\u201345.\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in\npredictability that would result from stripping a plan\nadministrator of Firestone deference. After declining to\napply a deferential standard here, the District Court\nadopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac\ncount for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at\n458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is\nheresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries\ntell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan\nresembling this one that did not include some adjustment\nfor the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as\nAmici Curiae 12.\n  Respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testified before the\nDistrict Court that fairness would require recognizing the\ntime value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,\n130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis\npute that the District Court\u2019s approach, which does not\naccount for the fact that respondents were able to use\ntheir past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,\nwould place respondents in a better position than employ\nees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents\n42\u201343; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32\u201333.\nDeference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all\nbeneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for\nparticular employees.\n  Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems\nthat arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone\ndeference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation\nof the Plan that does account for the time value of money,\nXerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar\nXerox employees could be entitled to different benefits\ndepending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring\na legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(e)(2) (permitting suit\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

In\nfact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation\nover the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of\nthe phantom account method, but held that the Plan\nAdministrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac\ncounting for rehired employees\u2019 past distributions\u2014which\nwould presumably include taking some cognizance of the\ntime value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement\nIncome Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875\u2013876 (2006);\nBrief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene\nfits Council as Amici Curiae 8\u20139. Thus, failing to defer to\nthe Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to\nbe subject to different interpretations in California and\nNew York. \u201cUniformity is impossible, however, if plans\nare subject to different legal obligations in different\nStates.\u201d Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).\nFirestone deference serves to avoid that result and to\npreserve the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d of interests that ERISA\nrepresents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.\n                               C\n   In spite of all this, respondents and the Government\nargue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone\ndeference in this case would actually disserve the purposes\nof ERISA. They argue that continued deference would\nencourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable\ninterpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis\ntrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their\nplans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they\nargue that plan administrators would be able to proceed\nseriatim through several interpretations of their plans,\neach time receiving deference, thereby undermining the\nprompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up\nlitigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal\nlenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.\n14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that\ndeference would be required in the extreme circumstances\nthat respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may\nbe stripped of deference when he does not exercise his\ndiscretion \u201chonestly and fairly.\u201d 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.\nMultiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi\nsion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a\nfinding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to\nexercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of\ncostly litigation that respondents fear.\n   Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean\nthat the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It\nmeans only that the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation of\nthe plan \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Firestone,\n489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (\u201c \u2018Where discretion is\nconferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a\npower, its exercise is not subject to control by the court\nexcept to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre\ntion\u2019 \u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187)).\nThus, far from \u201cimpos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re\nquirement\u201d that courts must defer to plan administrators,\npost, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should\nhave applied the standard established in Firestone and\nGlenn.\n                            III\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District\nCourt could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the\nCourt of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta\ntion by the Administrator to be invalid.

To explain my view, I shall describe the\nthree significant mistakes involved in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension\nplan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan\nAdministrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under\u00ad\nstand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon\nretirement. App. 29a\u201331a. These benefits are calculated\nas follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of\nthe Plan):\n    (1) \u201cThe Pension\u201d: Take your average salary for your\n    five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per\u00ad\n    cent; and multiply again by the number of years you\n    worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a\u201311a, 29a\u201330a.\n    Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid\n    years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30\n    years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per\n    year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 percent \u00d7 30).\n    (2) \u201cThe Cash Account\u201d: Every year, Xerox credits 5\n2               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.\n    This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1\n    percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at\n    41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your cash account and convert the\n    final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you\n    have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the\n    relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is\n    7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi\u00ad\n    mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap\u00ad\n    proximately $200,000 \u00d77 percent).\n    (3) \u201cThe Investment Account\u201d: Before 1990, Xerox\n    contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at\n    33a\u201334a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the\n    end of 1989 have an investment account that consists\n    of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit\n    sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in\u00ad\n    vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a\u2013\n    36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your investment account and con\u00ad\n    vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.\n    Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued\n    $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity\n    rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you\n    would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000\n    per year upon your retirement (approximately\n    $400,000 \u00d7 7 percent).\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee\u2019s pen\u00ad\nsion would come from the investment account, and the\nemployee would receive $28,000 per year.\n  This case concerns one aspect of Xerox\u2019s retirement\nplan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees\nwho leave Xerox and later return, working for additional\nyears before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long\ntreated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(again, I simplify and use my own words):\n   First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a\nlump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has\naccrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,\nher cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of\n1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.\n   Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to\naccrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a\u201341a, start\u00ad\ning from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment\naccount, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing\ncontributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re\u00ad\ntirement the employee may not have accrued much money\nin this account.\n   Third, a rehired employee\u2019s pension is calculated in the\nway I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox\n(both before her departure and after her return) taken into\naccount. See Brief for Petitioners 9\u201310.\n   Fourth, the employee\u2019s benefits calculation is adjusted\nto take account of the fact that the employee has already\nreceived a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.\n32a; Brief for Petitioners 10\u201311.\n   This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur\u00ad\ning step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad\u00ad\nministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the\nfact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has\nalready received a distribution when she initially left\nXerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the\nadjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ\u00ad\nously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the\namount that would have existed in the investment account\nhad no distribution been made.

Thus, if an employee\nhad not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her\ninvestment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would\nlikely have increased dramatically\u2014perhaps doubling,\ntripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how\nwell the Plan\u2019s investments performed.\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is this hypothetical sum\u2014termed the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount,\u201d ante, at 2\u2014that is at issue in this case. Xerox\u2019s\npre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this\nhypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire\u00ad\nment from the company, and in effect subtracted the\namount from the employee\u2019s benefits upon her departure.\nBrief for Petitioners 10\u201311; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on\nhow the Plan\u2019s investments did over time, the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s use of this \u201cphantom account\u201d could have a substan\u00ad\ntial impact on a rehired employee\u2019s benefits. (See Appen\u00ad\ndix, infra, for an example of how this \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks.)\n   When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox\u2019s Em\u00ad\nployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\nPlan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an\n\u201cinadverten[t]\u201d omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In\na section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100\nleaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,\nthe Plan said that it would \u201coffset\u201d the retiring employees\u2019\n\u201caccrued benefit\u201d (as ordinarily calculated) \u201cby the accrued\nbenefit attributable\u201d to the prior lump-sum \u201cdistribution\u201d\nthose employees received when they initially left Xerox.\nApp. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would\ncalculate this \u201coffset.\u201d In other words, the Plan said noth\u00ad\ning about the Administrator\u2019s use of the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount.\u201d\n   This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the\nPlan\u2019s failure to include language explaining how the\nAdministrator would take into account an employee\u2019s prior\ndistribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology. In essence, the\nAdministrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language\nthat had been omitted\u2014an interpretation that, as de\u00ad\nscribed below, see Part I\u2013B, infra, the Court of Appeals\nfound to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of\nERISA.\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   The District Court committed the second mistake in this\ncase. In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who\nleft and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.\nAnte, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii\u2013iii, 12. They pointed out\nthat the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re\u00ad\ntirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already\nreceived a lump-sum benefits distribution when they\ninitially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989\nPlan, nor the 1989 Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description, said\nanything about whether (or how) the Administrator would\nadjust their previous benefits distribution to take into\naccount that they had received the distribution well before\ntheir retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin\u00ad\nistrator could not use the \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology\nto adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 4\u20135.\n   The District Court, however, rejected respondents\u2019\nclaims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004). The court\naccepted the Administrator\u2019s argument that the 1989 Plan\nimplicitly incorporated the \u201cphantom account\u201d approach\nthat had previously been part of Xerox\u2019s retirement plan.\nId., at 433\u2013434. And the court thus held in favor of peti\u00ad\ntioners\u2014thereby committing the second mistake in this\ncase. Id., at 439.\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court and vacated the District Court\u2019s decision in\nrelevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about\nhow the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits\ndistributions, it was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for the\nAdministrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in\u00ad\ncorporated the \u201cphantom account.\u201d Id., at 265\u2013266, and\nn. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan\u00ad\nguage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at\nthe least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith fair notice that the Administrator was going to use\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d approach. See id., at 265 (discuss\u00ad\ning 29 U. S. C. \u00a71022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267\u2013268\n(holding that the Administrator\u2019s attempt to apply the\n\u201cphantom account\u201d to respondents violated two other\nERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. \u00a71054(h)\u2019s notice require\u00ad\nment and \u00a71054(g)\u2019s prohibition on retroactive benefit\ncutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents \u201clikely\nbelieved\u201d\u2014based on the language of the Plan\u2014\u201cthat their\npast distributions would only be factored into their [cur\u00ad\nrent] benefits calculations by taking into account the\namounts they had actually received.\u201d 433 F. 3d, at 267.\n  In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec\u00ad\nognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations\u2014a remedy\nthat took into account the previous benefits distributions\nrespondents had received in a manner consistent with the\n1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court, with the following instructions:\n    \u201cOn remand, the remedy crafted by the district court\n    for those employees [in the respondents\u2019 situation]\n    should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula\u00ad\n    tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif\u00ad\n    ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the\n    district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ\n    equitable principles when determining the appropri\u00ad\n    ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem\u00ad\n    edy.\u201d Id., at 268.\n  On remand, the District Court invited the parties to\nsubmit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners\n14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that\nwould adjust respondents\u2019 previous benefits distributions\nby adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator\nsuggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new\nhires.

The District Court rejected these suggestions and\nconcluded that the \u201cappropriate\u201d remedy was the one\nsuggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the\nprior distributions received by respondents.              472\nF. Supp. 2d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007). The court stated that\nthis remedy was \u201cstraightforward; it adequately pre\u00ad\nvent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it\nmost clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would\nhave anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in\nthe Plan.\u201d Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that\nthe District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a\nremedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).\n                             II\n   The third mistake, I believe, is the Court\u2019s. As the\nmajority recognizes, ante, at 4, \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d\nguide this Court in \u201cdetermining the appropriate stan\u00ad\ndard\u201d by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan\nadministrator. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489\nU. S. 101, 111\u2013113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4);\nAetna Health Inc. v.

And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,\nwhere an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre\u00ad\ntionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re\nquires a court to defer to the plan administrator\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____\n(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that\ntrust law \u201cdoes not resolve the specific issue before\u201d the\nCourt in this case\u2014i.e., whether a court is required to\ndefer to an administrator\u2019s second attempt at interpreting\nplan documents, even after the court has already deter\u00ad\nmined that the administrator\u2019s first attempt amounted to\nan abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final\n8                 CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid\nand inflexible requirement.\n   The Second Circuit found the Administrator\u2019s interpre\u00ad\ntation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in\nviolation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District\nCourt\u2019s task on remand was to \u201ccraf[t]\u201d a \u201cremedy.\u201d See\n433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in\nthese circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its\nown discretion rather than defer to a trustee\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees \u00a7560, pp. 222\u2013223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of\ndiscretion, a court may \u201cdecid[e] for the trustee how he\nshould act,\u201d possibly by \u201cstating the exact result\u201d the court\n\u201cdesires to achieve\u201d); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts \u00a750, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)\n(\u201cA discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is\nsubject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta\u00ad\ntion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee\u201d); 1 Restate\u00ad\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter\nSecond Restatement) (\u201cWhere discretion is conferred upon\nthe trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the\ncourt, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his\ndiscretion\u201d); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges\ndeciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,\nColton v. Colton, 127 U.

In short, the controlling trust law princi\u00ad\nple appears to be that, \u201c[w]here the court finds that there\nhas been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to\nbe rendered is in its discretion.\u201d Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at\n222.\n   Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre\u00ad\ntion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion\nin all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of\nScott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is \u201cno\nreason\u201d to doubt that a trustee \u201cwill . . . fairly exercise\u201d his\n\u201cdiscretion,\u201d then courts \u201cordinarily will not fix the\namount\u201d of a payment \u201cbut will instead direct the trustee\nto make reasonable provision for the beneficiary\u2019s sup\u00ad\nport,\u201d 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and\nAscher on Trusts \u00a718.2.1, pp. 1348\u20131349 (5th ed. 2007)\n(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there\nare situations in which a court will typically defer to a\ntrustee\u2019s remedial suggestion.      The word \u201cordinarily\u201d\nconfirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog\u00ad\nnize that there are instances in which courts will not\ndefer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust\nlaw gives the district courts authority to decide which\ninstances are which. See Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at 222\u2013\n223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court \u201cmay set\naside the transaction,\u201d \u201caward damages to the benefici\u00ad\nary,\u201d or \u201corder a new decision to be made in the light of\nrules expounded by the court\u201d); 2 Third Restatement \u00a750,\nand Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op\u00ad\ntions); 1 Second Restatement \u00a7187, and Comment b, at\n402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement \u00a787, and Com\u00ad\nment c, at 244\u2013245 (noting that \u201cjudicial intervention on\nthe ground of abuse\u201d is allowed when a \u201cgood-faith,\u201d yet\n\u201cunreasonable,\u201d decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,\nsupra, at 54\u201355, 308 S. W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court\u2019s\nremedial options).\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as\nestablishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to\na trustee\u2019s fallback position absent \u201creason to believe that\n[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly\u2014for\nexample, upon a showing that the trustee has already\nacted in bad faith.\u201d Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,\nthe majority further concludes that the existence of the\nScott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under\nbasic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a\nremedy for a trustee\u2019s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6\u20139.\n  It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the\npassage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ\u00ad\ners, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8\n(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so\neasily be read as consistent with one another. I simply\nread the Scott treatise language as identifying circum\u00ad\nstances in which courts typically choose to defer to an\nadministrator\u2019s fallback position. The treatise does not\nsuggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own\nin the exercise of its broad remedial authority\u2014authority\nthat trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139.\n  A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under\u00ad\nstanding. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the\npassage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott\n\u00a718.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state\nthat a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if\na trustee has previously abused its discretion. See Old\nColony Trust Co. v. Rodd, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N. E.\n2d 886, 889 (1970) (\u201cA court of equity may control a trus\u00ad\ntee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to\nobserve standards of judgment apparent from the applica\u00ad\nble instrument\u201d); In re Marre\u2019s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190,\n114 P. 2d 586, 590\u2013591 (1941) (\u201cIt is well settled that the\ncourts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has\nbeen confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Three other cases are inapposite because\ntheir circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse\nof discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler\u2019s Trusts, 157\nSo. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) (per curiam)\n(\u201cThere is no contention here that the court . . . would not\nretain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other plead\u00ad\nings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if\nany, of the discretion exercised by the trustees\u201d); In re\nGrubel\u2019s Will, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N. Y. S. 2d 21, 23\n(Surr. Ct. 1962) (stating that \u201cin the first instance\u201d it is\nthe \u201cproper function of the trustees\u201d to set an amount to be\npaid (emphasis added)); Orr v.

In the final case, the\ncourt decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to\ncontrol the trustees\u2019 discretion. See Estate of Stillman,\n107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y. S. 2d 701 (Surr.

Which of these cases says that, after the\ntrustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still\ndefer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a\nsingle case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the\nmajority\u2019s reading of the treatise.\n   The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott\ntreatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise\ndoes not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court\nthought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised\njudgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee\nto do so. See In re Sullivan\u2019s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40\u201341, 12\n12                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nN. W. 2d 148, 150\u2013151 (1943) (finding that the trustees\u2019\n\u201cfailure to act\u201d was erroneous, and directing the trustees\nto exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount);\nEaton v.

The fourth case concerns circum\u00ad\nstances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to\nknow what to say. (The question was whether the benefi\u00ad\nciary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or\nwhether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate\nthem in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding\nthat, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in\nthat particular case should seek to have the trustee re\u00ad\nmoved rather than trying to administer the trust funds\nitself.) See Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 460\u2013461, 183\nA. 271, 272\u2013273 (1936).\n   I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to\nwhich the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a\ngeneral matter, is required to defer to a trust administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am\naware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and\nBogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in\nwhich courts have remedied a trustee\u2019s abuse of discretion\nby ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2\nThird Restatement \u00a750, Reporter\u2019s Note, at 283 (citing\ncases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566\n(1922)); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases\nsuch as Rubion); 3 Scott \u00a718.2.1, at 1348\u20131349, nn. 3\u20134\n(citing cases such as Emmert v.

The Ad\u00ad\nministrator had previously abused his discretionary\npower. Id., at 265\u2013268. And the District Court found that\nthe Administrator\u2019s primary remedial suggestion on re\u00ad\nmand\u2014adjusting respondents\u2019 previous benefits distribu\u00ad\ntions by adding interest\u2014probably would have violated\nERISA\u2019s notice provisions. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. Under\nthese circumstances, the District Court reasonably could\nhave found a need to use its own remedial judgment,\nrather than rely on the Administrator\u2019s\u2014which is just\nwhat the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.\n   Moreover, even if the \u201cnarrow\u201d trust law \u201cquestion\nbefore us\u201d were difficult, ante, at 6\u2014which it is not\u2014this\ndifficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its\nbest to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects\nbasic principles of trust law. \u201cCongress invoked the com\u00ad\nmon law of trusts\u201d in enacting ERISA, and this Court has\nthus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine\n\u201cthe particular duties and powers\u201d of ERISA plan adminis\u00ad\ntrators.

S., at 111\u2013113. While, as the majority recognizes, ante,\nat 8, trust law may \u201cnot tell the entire story,\u201d Varity Corp.\nv. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other\ncase in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on\nthe basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule\nbased on nothing but \u201cthe guiding principles we have\nidentified underlying ERISA,\u201d ante, at 9. See Varity,\nsupra, at 497 (\u201cIn some instances, trust law will offer only\na starting point, after which courts must go on to ask\nwhether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its\nstructure, or its purposes require departing from common\u00ad\nlaw trust requirements\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, it is far from clear that the Court\u2019s legal\nrule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based\npolicy. To the contrary, the majority\u2019s absolute \u201cone free\nhonest mistake\u201d rule is impractical, for it requires courts\nto determine what is \u201chonest,\u201d encourages appeals on the\npoint, and threatens to delay further proceedings that\nalready take too long. (Respondents initially filed this\nretirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have\npointed out\u2014namely, that abuses of discretion \u201carise in\ntoo many contexts\u201d and \u201cconcern too many circumstances\u201d\nfor this Court \u201cto come up with a one-size-fits-all proce\u00ad\ndural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu\u00ad\nrate\u201d benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the\nmajority\u2019s approach creates incentives for administrators\nto take \u201cone free shot\u201d at employer-favorable plan inter\u00ad\npretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the\nfirst instance with the expectation that they will have\nrepeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter\u00ad\npret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the\nmajority\u2019s \u201cone free honest mistake\u201d approach furthers\nERISA\u2019s core purpose of \u201cpromot[ing] the interests of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985) (ERISA\nwas enacted \u201cto protect contractually defined benefits\u201d).\n   The majority does identify ERISA-related factors\u2014e.g.,\npromoting predictability and uniformity, encouraging\nemployers to adopt strong plans\u2014that it believes favor\ngiving more power to plan administrators. See ante, at 9\u2013\n13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset\nby the factors discussed above\u2014e.g., discouraging admin\u00ad\nistrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them\naggressively\u2014that argue to the contrary. At best, the\npolicies at issue\u2014some arguing in one direction, some the\nother\u2014are far less able than trust law to provide a \u201cguid\u00ad\ning principle.\u201d Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,\ntrust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to\napproach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.\nSee, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111\u2013113. And trust law\nhere, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the\ndecision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis\u00ad\ntrator\u2019s remedial opinion.\n                            III\n  Since the District Court was not required to defer to the\nAdministrator\u2019s fallback position, I should consider the\nsecond question presented, namely, whether the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the District Court\u2019s decision\nunder an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. Ante, at 4 (ac\u00ad\nknowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to\nthis question depends upon how one characterizes the\n16               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision. If the court deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s interpretation of Plan terms, then the\nCourt of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the\ndecision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,\nsupra, at 210 (\u201cAny dispute over the precise terms of the\nplan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan\u00ad\ndard\u201d). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s creation of a remedy, in significant part on\nthe basis of \u201cequitable principles,\u201d then it properly re\u00ad\nviewed the District Court decision for \u201cabuse of discre\u00ad\ntion.\u201d See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\nF. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277\nF. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere\nLife Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.\nW. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).\n   The District Court opinion contains language that sup\u00ad\nports either characterization. On the one hand, the court\nwrote that its task was to \u201cinterpret the Plan as written.\u201d\n472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said\nthat \u201cvirtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the\n[Summary Plan Description]\u201d about how to treat prior\ndistributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the\nCourt of Appeals had directed it to use \u201cequitable princi\u00ad\nples\u201d in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court appears to have used both the Plan language\nand equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See\nid., at 457\u2013459.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports\nboth characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting\nthat the District Court \u201capplied [Plan] terms\u201d in crafting\nits remedy), with id., at 117\u2013119 (describing the District\nCourt\u2019s decision as the \u201ccraft[ing]\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d and\nacknowledging that it had directed the District Court to\nuse \u201cequitable principles\u201d in doing so). But the Court of\nAppeals ultimately treated the District Court\u2019s opinion as\nif it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

And I consequently believe the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the result for an \u201cabuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d\n   Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek\u00ad\ning relief under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), the Court of\nAppeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem\u00ad\nedy as anything other than an application of a plan\u2019s\nterms. Brief for Petitioners 55\u201356; Reply Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioners 3, and n. 8, 16\u201317. While this provision allows\nplaintiffs only to \u201cenforce\u201d or \u201cclarify\u201d rights or to \u201crecover\nbenefits\u201d \u201cunder the terms of the plan,\u201d \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\n(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court\u2019s remedial\nauthority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), \u201cCongress\nauthorized \u2018a participant or beneficiary\u2019 to bring a civil\naction . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought\nis legal or equitable\u201d). The provision thus does not pro\u00ad\nhibit a court from shaping relief through the application of\nequitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,\ne.g., 2 Third Restatement \u00a750, and Comment b, at 261\n(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7870, at\n123\u2013126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for\nexample, that an administrator provided employees with\ninadequate notice of a plan\u2019s terms (as was true here) may\nhave no alternative but to rely significantly upon those\nprinciples. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary\nmust \u201cdischarge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as\nsuch documents and instruments are consistent\u201d with\nERISA).\n   For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s contrary determination.\n18               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n              AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                    B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n                  The \u201cPhantom Account\u201d \n\n   This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative\nexample of, as I understand it, how the \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the\nfollowing assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years\nfrom 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from\nXerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of\n$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he\nworked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until\nDecember 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second\nterm of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox\u2019s con\u00ad\ntribution to John\u2019s investment account was $2,500 in 1989\n(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox\u2019s\ncontributions to John\u2019s cash and investment accounts are\nalways made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of\nreturn in John\u2019s cash and investment accounts is always 5\npercent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.\n(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe\u00ad\ntuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the\nannuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay\u00ad\nment/Annuity Rate.)\n   Given the above assumptions, John\u2019s pension upon his\nretirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 per\u00ad\ncent \u00d7 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000\n($10,500/5 percent). John\u2019s cash and investment accounts\nat the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While\nXerox\u2019s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until\n1990, each employee\u2019s opening cash account balance was\ncredited with the balance of his investment account at the\nend of 1989. The figures for John\u2019s cash account in 1989\nthus reflect the performance of his investment account. In\naddition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun\u00ad\ndred):\n                        Cite as: 559 U.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator\nwould assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu\u00ad\nlating John\u2019s pension. The Plan Administrator would also\nassume, when calculating the value of John\u2019s cash and\ninvestment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John\nhad received from Xerox had remained invested in his\naccounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would\ninclude the \u201cphantom account\u201d in his calculations. The\ntotal value of this phantom account in 1989, when John\nrejoined Xerox, is equal to John\u2019s lump-sum distribution of\n$140,000 \u00d7 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)\n   The Plan Administrator would thus compare John\u2019s\npension, column D, and column H to determine John\u2019s\nbenefit. As you can see above, column H provides the\ngreatest benefit, so John\u2019s cash account would be used to\ncalculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.\n   Second, the Plan Administrator would \u201coffset\u201d John\u2019s\nprior distribution against his current benefits to deter\u00ad\nmine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.\nThus, the Plan Administrator would take the \u201ctotal\u201d value\nof John\u2019s cash account, including the \u201cphantom account\u201d\n($277,800), and subtract out the value of the \u201cphantom\n20              CONKRIGHT v.

The total present value of the bene\u00ad\nfits John would receive upon his second retirement would\nthus be $13,800.\n   This means that John would receive approximately $690\nannually ($13,800 \u00d7 5 percent) upon retirement under the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s \u201cphantom account\u201d approach. In\ncomparison, if John had simply been treated as a new\nemployee when he was rehired, his pension would have\nentitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4\npercent \u00d7 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d may have been even more dramatic\nwith respect to some of the respondents in this case. See\nBrief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul\nFrommert erroneously received a report claiming that his\nretirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later\ndiscovering that, because of the \u201cphantom account,\u201d his\nactual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also\nApp. 63a.\n",

Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided April 21, 2010\nPetitioners are Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan\u2019s\n  current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon\n  dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980\u2019s, received lump-sum\n  distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were\n  later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating\n  respondents\u2019 current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter\n  preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as\n  the \u201cphantom account\u201d method. Respondents challenged that method\n  in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n  1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for\n  the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that\n  the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable and that\n  respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac\n  count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,\n  the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan\n  that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre\n  viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential\n  standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach\n  proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of\n  money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the\n  District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re\n  mand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on the merits was not an\n  abuse of discretion.\nHeld: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of\n review to the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\n mand. Pp. 4\u201315.\n    (a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions\n of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n2                      CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for\n    guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de\n    pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a\n    trust instrument gives the trustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or\n    doubtful terms, . . . the trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed\n    if reasonable.\u201d Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan\u2019s terms, the Plan\n    Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in\n    terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex\n    ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a\n    deferential standard when a plan administrator\u2019s previous construc\n    tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach has\n    no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference\n    with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This\n    Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,\n    that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in\n    terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of\n    that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should\n    require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit\u2019s decision sup\n    ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were\n    based\u2014the plan\u2019s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA\u2019s purposes.\n    The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author\n    ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to\n    construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re\n    quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA\n    but do not \u201ctell the entire story.\u201d Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,\n    497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts\n    may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good\n    faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.\n       ERISA represents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\n    prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of\n    the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.\n    200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this \u201ccareful balancing\u201d and\n    protects the statute\u2019s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni\n    formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a\n    plan administrator\u2019s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but\n    the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud\n    denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus\n    trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def\n    erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more\n    complicated than necessary. Respondents\u2019 approach threatens to in\n    terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that \u201cwould create fur\n    ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al\n    ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.\u201d Glenn, supra, at ___.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform\n  ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone\n  deference. The District Court\u2019s interpretation does not account for\n  the time value of money, but respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testi\n  fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents\n  do not dispute that the District Court\u2019s approach would place them in\n  a better position than employees who never left the company. If\n  other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of\n  money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in\n  which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations\n  in different States. Pp. 5\u201313.\n     (c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea\n  sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference\n  each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis\n  putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from\n  challenging administrators\u2019 decisions. These concerns are overblown\n  because there is no reason to think that deference would be required\n  in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er\n  roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in\n  good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too\n  incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds\n  of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential\n  standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator\n  will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin\n  istrator\u2019s interpretation \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Fire\n  stone, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA\nplans. That should come as no surprise, given that the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is \u201can\nenormously complex and detailed statute,\u201d Mertens v.\nHewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 262 (1993), and the plans\nthat administrators must construe can be lengthy and\ncomplicated. (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with\n139 sections.) We held in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nBruch, 489 U. S. 101 (1989), that an ERISA plan adminis\ntrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is\nentitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The\nquestion here is whether a single honest mistake in plan\ninterpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that\ndeference for subsequent related interpretations of the\nplan. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are\nexceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual\ndetails are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we\n2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncover them only in broad strokes.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief\nfor Respondents 9\u201310. The dispute giving rise to this case\nconcerns how to account for respondents\u2019 past distribu\ntions when calculating their current benefits\u2014that is, how\nto avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.\n   The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to\ncall for an approach that has come to be known as the\n\u201cphantom account\u201d method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.\nEssentially, that method calculated the hypothetical\ngrowth that respondents\u2019 past distributions would have\nexperienced if the money had remained in Xerox\u2019s invest\nment funds, and reduced respondents\u2019 present benefits\naccordingly. See id., at 426\u2013428; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents\u2019\nadministrative challenges to that method, respondents\nfiled suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428\u2013429. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,\napplying a deferential standard of review to the Plan\nAdministrator\u2019s interpretation. See id., at 430\u2013431, 439.\nThe Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that\nthe Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable\nand that respondents had not been adequately notified\nthat the phantom account method would be used to calcu\nlate their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265\u2013269\n(2006).\n   The phantom account method having been exorcised\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Plan, the District Court on remand considered\nother approaches for adjusting respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.\n2d 452, 456\u2013458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator\nsubmitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like\nthe phantom account method, accounted for the time value\nof the money that respondents had previously received.\nBut unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin\nistrator\u2019s new approach did not calculate the present value\nof a past distribution based on events that occurred after\nthe distribution was made. Instead, the new approach\nused an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the\ndistribution, thereby calculating the current value of the\ndistribution based on information that was known at the\ntime of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a\u2013\n153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should\napply a deferential standard of review to this approach,\nand accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.\nSee Defendants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies\nin No. 00\u2013CV\u20136311 (WDNY), pp. 7\u20138; Defendants\u2019 Pre-\nHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00\u2013CV\u2013\n6311 (WDNY), p. 2.\n   The District Court did not apply a deferential standard\nof review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am\nbiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed\nby respondents that did not account for the time value of\nmoney. Under that approach, respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past\ndistributions\u2014thereby treating a dollar distributed to\nrespondents in the 1980\u2019s as equal in value to a dollar\ndistributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457\u2013458. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the\nDistrict Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan\ndard on remand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on\nthe merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n111, 119 (2008).\n   Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques\ntions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\nmand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly\ngranted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.\n                              II\n                               A\n   This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the\ndecisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489\nU. S. 101. Because ERISA\u2019s text does not directly resolve\nthe matter, we looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for guid\nance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust\nlaw, the proper standard of review of a trustee\u2019s decision\ndepends on the language of the instrument creating the\ntrust. See id., at 111\u2013112. If the trust documents give the\ntrustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .\nthe trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason\nable.\u201d Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held\nthat \u201ca denial of benefits challenged under \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\nis to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre\ntionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\nconstrue the terms of the plan.\u201d Id., at 115.\n   We expanded Firestone\u2019s approach in Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the\nproper standard of review when a plan administrator\noperates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to\ntrust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles\nof ERISA\u2014plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6\u20137, 9\u201310). We held that,\nwhen the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to\nthe plan administrator, a deferential standard of review\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nremains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of\nthe Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be\nentitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328\nF. Supp. 2d, at 430\u2013431 (observing that the Plan grants\nthe Plan Administrator \u201cbroad discretion in making deci\nsions relative to the Plan\u201d). The Court of Appeals, how\never, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi\ncally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a\ndeferential standard \u201cwhere the administrator ha[s] previ\nously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such\na construction to have violated ERISA.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 119.\nUnder that view, the District Court here was entitled to\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by\nthe Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap\npeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.       Cf. ibid. (accepting the District\nCourt\u2019s chosen method as one of \u201cseveral reasonable\nalternatives\u201d).\n                               B\n  We reject this \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach.\nBrief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no\nbasis in the Court\u2019s holding in Firestone, which set out a\nbroad standard of deference without any suggestion that\nthe standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the\none adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at\n111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception\nto Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA\nlaw was already complicated enough without adding\n\u201cspecial procedural or evidentiary rules\u201d to the mix. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a\nsystemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis\ntrator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi\ncult to see why a single honest mistake would require a\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent result.\n  Nor is the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision supported by the\nconsiderations on which our holdings in Firestone and\nGlenn were based\u2014namely, the terms of the plan, princi\nples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,\nat 4\u20135. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator\ngeneral authority to \u201c[c]onstrue the Plan.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 141a\u2013142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that\nthe grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe\nthe Plan.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019 exception to Firestone\ndeference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust\nlaw is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading\ntreatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis\ncretion when there is reason to believe that he will not\nexercise that discretion fairly\u2014for example, upon a show\ning that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:\n    \u201cIf the trustee\u2019s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to\n    the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer\n    cise [the trustee\u2019s] discretion honestly and fairly, the\n    court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On\n    the other hand, if the trustee\u2019s failure to provide rea\n    sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to\n    the trustee\u2019s duties or powers, and there is no reason\n    to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis\n    cretion once the court has determined the extent of\n    the trustee\u2019s duties and powers, the court ordinarily\n    will not fix the amount but will instead direct the\n    trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici\n    ary\u2019s support.\u201d 3 A.

Ascher,\n    Scott and Ascher on Trusts \u00a718.2.1, pp. 1348\u20131349\n    (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote\n    omitted) (citing cases).\nThis is not surprising\u2014if the settlor who creates a trust\ngrants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Another treatise states that, after a\ntrustee has abused his discretion, \u201c[s]ometimes the court\ndecides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating\nthe exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some\nlimits on the trustee\u2019s action and giving him leeway within\nthose limits.\u201d G.

S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cIn some instances, trust law will offer only a starting\npoint, after which courts must go on to ask whether, or to\nwhat extent, the language of the statute, its structure, or\nits purposes require departing from common-law trust\nrequirements\u201d); Brief for Respondents 50 (pressing same\nview as the dissent but concluding that the dispute over\ntrust law \u201cneed not be resolved\u201d). Here trust law does not\nresolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi\nples we have identified underlying ERISA do.\n   Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees\nwould receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress\ndid not require employers to establish benefit plans in the\nfirst place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887\n(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre\nsents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health\nInc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life\nIns. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress\nsought \u201cto create a system that is [not] so complex that\nadministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis\ncourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first\nplace.\u201d Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA \u201cinduc[es]\nemployers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of\nliabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\nand a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and\nawards when a violation has occurred.\u201d Rush Prudential\nHMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 379 (2002).\n   Firestone deference protects these interests and, by\npermitting an employer to grant primary interpretive\nauthority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator,\npreserves the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d on which ERISA is\nbased. Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging\nresolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis\ntrative proceedings rather than costly litigation. It also\npromotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpertise of the plan administrator rather than worry\nabout unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that\nmight result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,\nFirestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,\nhelping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of\na plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ\nent jurisdictions\u2014a result that \u201cwould introduce consider\nable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which\nmight lead those employers with existing plans to reduce\nbenefits, and those without such plans to refrain from\nadopting them.\u201d Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\nU. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries\ntells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an\nERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by\nfederal law, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is\ninterpreted to mean different things in different places.\nSee Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5\u201311.\n   Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do\nnot question that deference to plan administrators serves\nthese important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer\nence is less important once a plan administrator has is\nsued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.\nBut the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform\nity\u2014and the manner in which they are promoted by defer\nence to reasonable plan construction by administrators\u2014\ndo not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis\ntrator has made a single honest mistake.\n   This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter\nest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by\ngranting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the\nPlan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis\ntrict Court had applied a deferential standard of review\nunder Firestone, the question before it would have been\nwhether the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the\nPlan was reasonable. After answering that question, the\ncase might well have been over. Instead, the District\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the\nmore complicated question of how best to interpret the\nPlan.\n   The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in\nrespondents\u2019 approach does not end there. Under respon\ndents\u2019 and the Government\u2019s view, the question whether a\ndeferential standard of review was required in this case\nturns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting\nthe \u201csame terms\u201d or deciding the \u201csame issue\u201d on remand.\nSee Brief for Respondents 43, 46\u201348, 53, and n. 13; Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 13\u201315, 23. Whether\nthat condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,\npetitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the\nPlan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on\nremand\u2014how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific\nprovisions requiring use of the phantom account method\ncould not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 50\u201351. Respondents would force\nthe parties to litigate this potentially complicated \u201csame\nissue\u201d or \u201csame terms\u201d question before a district court\ncould even decide whether deference is owed to a plan\nadministrator\u2019s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is\nlittle place in the ERISA context for these sorts of \u201cspecial\nprocedural rules [that] would create further complexity,\nadding time and expense to a process that may already be\ntoo costly for many of those who seek redress.\u201d 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   The position of respondents and the Government could\ninterject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For\nexample, even under their view, the District Court here\ncould have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;\nthe court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for\nRespondents 43, 49\u201350, 52\u201353; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23\u201324. That raises the question of how a\ncourt is to decide between the two options; respondents\u2019\nanswer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,\n12               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40\u201345.\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in\npredictability that would result from stripping a plan\nadministrator of Firestone deference. After declining to\napply a deferential standard here, the District Court\nadopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac\ncount for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at\n458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is\nheresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries\ntell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan\nresembling this one that did not include some adjustment\nfor the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as\nAmici Curiae 12.\n  Respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testified before the\nDistrict Court that fairness would require recognizing the\ntime value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,\n130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis\npute that the District Court\u2019s approach, which does not\naccount for the fact that respondents were able to use\ntheir past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,\nwould place respondents in a better position than employ\nees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents\n42\u201343; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32\u201333.\nDeference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all\nbeneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for\nparticular employees.\n  Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems\nthat arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone\ndeference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation\nof the Plan that does account for the time value of money,\nXerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar\nXerox employees could be entitled to different benefits\ndepending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring\na legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(e)(2) (permitting suit\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cwhere the plan is administered, where the breach took\nplace, or where a defendant resides or may be found\u201d). In\nfact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation\nover the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of\nthe phantom account method, but held that the Plan\nAdministrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac\ncounting for rehired employees\u2019 past distributions\u2014which\nwould presumably include taking some cognizance of the\ntime value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement\nIncome Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875\u2013876 (2006);\nBrief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene\nfits Council as Amici Curiae 8\u20139. Thus, failing to defer to\nthe Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to\nbe subject to different interpretations in California and\nNew York. \u201cUniformity is impossible, however, if plans\nare subject to different legal obligations in different\nStates.\u201d Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).\nFirestone deference serves to avoid that result and to\npreserve the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d of interests that ERISA\nrepresents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.\n                               C\n   In spite of all this, respondents and the Government\nargue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone\ndeference in this case would actually disserve the purposes\nof ERISA. They argue that continued deference would\nencourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable\ninterpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis\ntrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their\nplans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they\nargue that plan administrators would be able to proceed\nseriatim through several interpretations of their plans,\neach time receiving deference, thereby undermining the\nprompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up\nlitigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal\nlenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.\n14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that\ndeference would be required in the extreme circumstances\nthat respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may\nbe stripped of deference when he does not exercise his\ndiscretion \u201chonestly and fairly.\u201d 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.\nMultiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi\nsion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a\nfinding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to\nexercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of\ncostly litigation that respondents fear.\n   Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean\nthat the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It\nmeans only that the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation of\nthe plan \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Firestone,\n489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (\u201c \u2018Where discretion is\nconferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a\npower, its exercise is not subject to control by the court\nexcept to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre\ntion\u2019 \u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187)).\nThus, far from \u201cimpos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re\nquirement\u201d that courts must defer to plan administrators,\npost, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should\nhave applied the standard established in Firestone and\nGlenn.\n                            III\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District\nCourt could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the\nCourt of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta\ntion by the Administrator to be invalid. Because we re\nverse on that ground, we do not reach the question\nwhether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a\ndeferential standard of review to the decision of the Dis\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

To explain my view, I shall describe the\nthree significant mistakes involved in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension\nplan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan\nAdministrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under\u00ad\nstand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon\nretirement. App. 29a\u201331a. These benefits are calculated\nas follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of\nthe Plan):\n    (1) \u201cThe Pension\u201d: Take your average salary for your\n    five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per\u00ad\n    cent; and multiply again by the number of years you\n    worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a\u201311a, 29a\u201330a.\n    Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid\n    years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30\n    years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per\n    year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 percent \u00d7 30).\n    (2) \u201cThe Cash Account\u201d: Every year, Xerox credits 5\n2               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.\n    This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1\n    percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at\n    41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your cash account and convert the\n    final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you\n    have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the\n    relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is\n    7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi\u00ad\n    mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap\u00ad\n    proximately $200,000 \u00d77 percent).\n    (3) \u201cThe Investment Account\u201d: Before 1990, Xerox\n    contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at\n    33a\u201334a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the\n    end of 1989 have an investment account that consists\n    of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit\n    sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in\u00ad\n    vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a\u2013\n    36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your investment account and con\u00ad\n    vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.\n    Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued\n    $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity\n    rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you\n    would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000\n    per year upon your retirement (approximately\n    $400,000 \u00d7 7 percent).\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee\u2019s pen\u00ad\nsion would come from the investment account, and the\nemployee would receive $28,000 per year.\n  This case concerns one aspect of Xerox\u2019s retirement\nplan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees\nwho leave Xerox and later return, working for additional\nyears before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long\ntreated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(again, I simplify and use my own words):\n   First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a\nlump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has\naccrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,\nher cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of\n1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.\n   Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to\naccrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a\u201341a, start\u00ad\ning from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment\naccount, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing\ncontributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re\u00ad\ntirement the employee may not have accrued much money\nin this account.\n   Third, a rehired employee\u2019s pension is calculated in the\nway I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox\n(both before her departure and after her return) taken into\naccount. See Brief for Petitioners 9\u201310.\n   Fourth, the employee\u2019s benefits calculation is adjusted\nto take account of the fact that the employee has already\nreceived a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.\n32a; Brief for Petitioners 10\u201311.\n   This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur\u00ad\ning step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad\u00ad\nministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the\nfact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has\nalready received a distribution when she initially left\nXerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the\nadjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ\u00ad\nously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the\namount that would have existed in the investment account\nhad no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee\nhad not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her\ninvestment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would\nlikely have increased dramatically\u2014perhaps doubling,\ntripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how\nwell the Plan\u2019s investments performed.\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is this hypothetical sum\u2014termed the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount,\u201d ante, at 2\u2014that is at issue in this case. Xerox\u2019s\npre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this\nhypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire\u00ad\nment from the company, and in effect subtracted the\namount from the employee\u2019s benefits upon her departure.\nBrief for Petitioners 10\u201311; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on\nhow the Plan\u2019s investments did over time, the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s use of this \u201cphantom account\u201d could have a substan\u00ad\ntial impact on a rehired employee\u2019s benefits. (See Appen\u00ad\ndix, infra, for an example of how this \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks.)\n   When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox\u2019s Em\u00ad\nployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\nPlan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an\n\u201cinadverten[t]\u201d omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In\na section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100\nleaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,\nthe Plan said that it would \u201coffset\u201d the retiring employees\u2019\n\u201caccrued benefit\u201d (as ordinarily calculated) \u201cby the accrued\nbenefit attributable\u201d to the prior lump-sum \u201cdistribution\u201d\nthose employees received when they initially left Xerox.\nApp. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would\ncalculate this \u201coffset.\u201d In other words, the Plan said noth\u00ad\ning about the Administrator\u2019s use of the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount.\u201d\n   This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the\nPlan\u2019s failure to include language explaining how the\nAdministrator would take into account an employee\u2019s prior\ndistribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology. In essence, the\nAdministrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language\nthat had been omitted\u2014an interpretation that, as de\u00ad\nscribed below, see Part I\u2013B, infra, the Court of Appeals\nfound to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of\nERISA.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who\nleft and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.\nAnte, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii\u2013iii, 12. They pointed out\nthat the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re\u00ad\ntirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already\nreceived a lump-sum benefits distribution when they\ninitially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989\nPlan, nor the 1989 Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description, said\nanything about whether (or how) the Administrator would\nadjust their previous benefits distribution to take into\naccount that they had received the distribution well before\ntheir retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin\u00ad\nistrator could not use the \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology\nto adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 4\u20135.\n   The District Court, however, rejected respondents\u2019\nclaims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438746\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438746/frommert-v-conkright/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court\naccepted the Administrator\u2019s argument that the 1989 Plan\nimplicitly incorporated the \u201cphantom account\u201d approach\nthat had previously been part of Xerox\u2019s retirement plan.\nId., at 433\u2013434.

The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about\nhow the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits\ndistributions, it was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for the\nAdministrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in\u00ad\ncorporated the \u201cphantom account.\u201d Id., at 265\u2013266, and\nn. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan\u00ad\nguage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at\nthe least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents\n6                CONKRIGHT v.

Rather, the court noted, respondents \u201clikely\nbelieved\u201d\u2014based on the language of the Plan\u2014\u201cthat their\npast distributions would only be factored into their [cur\u00ad\nrent] benefits calculations by taking into account the\namounts they had actually received.\u201d 433 F. 3d, at 267.\n  In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec\u00ad\nognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations\u2014a remedy\nthat took into account the previous benefits distributions\nrespondents had received in a manner consistent with the\n1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court, with the following instructions:\n    \u201cOn remand, the remedy crafted by the district court\n    for those employees [in the respondents\u2019 situation]\n    should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula\u00ad\n    tion to determine their benefits.

The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that\nwould adjust respondents\u2019 previous benefits distributions\nby adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator\nsuggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new\nhires.

And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,\nwhere an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre\u00ad\ntionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re\nquires a court to defer to the plan administrator\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____\n(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that\ntrust law \u201cdoes not resolve the specific issue before\u201d the\nCourt in this case\u2014i.e., whether a court is required to\ndefer to an administrator\u2019s second attempt at interpreting\nplan documents, even after the court has already deter\u00ad\nmined that the administrator\u2019s first attempt amounted to\nan abuse of discretion.

Trust law treatise writers say that in\nthese circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its\nown discretion rather than defer to a trustee\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees \u00a7560, pp. 222\u2013223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of\ndiscretion, a court may \u201cdecid[e] for the trustee how he\nshould act,\u201d possibly by \u201cstating the exact result\u201d the court\n\u201cdesires to achieve\u201d); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts \u00a750, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)\n(\u201cA discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is\nsubject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta\u00ad\ntion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee\u201d); 1 Restate\u00ad\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter\nSecond Restatement) (\u201cWhere discretion is conferred upon\nthe trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the\ncourt, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his\ndiscretion\u201d); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges\ndeciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,\nColton v. Colton, 127 U.

The majority refers to the 2007 edition of\nScott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is \u201cno\nreason\u201d to doubt that a trustee \u201cwill . . . fairly exercise\u201d his\n\u201cdiscretion,\u201d then courts \u201cordinarily will not fix the\namount\u201d of a payment \u201cbut will instead direct the trustee\nto make reasonable provision for the beneficiary\u2019s sup\u00ad\nport,\u201d 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and\nAscher on Trusts \u00a718.2.1, pp. 1348\u20131349 (5th ed. 2007)\n(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there\nare situations in which a court will typically defer to a\ntrustee\u2019s remedial suggestion.      The word \u201cordinarily\u201d\nconfirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog\u00ad\nnize that there are instances in which courts will not\ndefer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust\nlaw gives the district courts authority to decide which\ninstances are which. See Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at 222\u2013\n223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court \u201cmay set\naside the transaction,\u201d \u201caward damages to the benefici\u00ad\nary,\u201d or \u201corder a new decision to be made in the light of\nrules expounded by the court\u201d); 2 Third Restatement \u00a750,\nand Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op\u00ad\ntions); 1 Second Restatement \u00a7187, and Comment b, at\n402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement \u00a787, and Com\u00ad\nment c, at 244\u2013245 (noting that \u201cjudicial intervention on\nthe ground of abuse\u201d is allowed when a \u201cgood-faith,\u201d yet\n\u201cunreasonable,\u201d decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,\nsupra, at 54\u201355, 308 S.

FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as\nestablishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to\na trustee\u2019s fallback position absent \u201creason to believe that\n[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly\u2014for\nexample, upon a showing that the trustee has already\nacted in bad faith.\u201d Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,\nthe majority further concludes that the existence of the\nScott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under\nbasic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a\nremedy for a trustee\u2019s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6\u20139.\n  It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the\npassage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ\u00ad\ners, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8\n(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so\neasily be read as consistent with one another. I simply\nread the Scott treatise language as identifying circum\u00ad\nstances in which courts typically choose to defer to an\nadministrator\u2019s fallback position. The treatise does not\nsuggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own\nin the exercise of its broad remedial authority\u2014authority\nthat trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139.\n  A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under\u00ad\nstanding. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the\npassage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott\n\u00a718.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state\nthat a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if\na trustee has previously abused its discretion.

See Varity,\nsupra, at 497 (\u201cIn some instances, trust law will offer only\na starting point, after which courts must go on to ask\nwhether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its\nstructure, or its purposes require departing from common\u00ad\nlaw trust requirements\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, it is far from clear that the Court\u2019s legal\nrule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based\npolicy. To the contrary, the majority\u2019s absolute \u201cone free\nhonest mistake\u201d rule is impractical, for it requires courts\nto determine what is \u201chonest,\u201d encourages appeals on the\npoint, and threatens to delay further proceedings that\nalready take too long. (Respondents initially filed this\nretirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have\npointed out\u2014namely, that abuses of discretion \u201carise in\ntoo many contexts\u201d and \u201cconcern too many circumstances\u201d\nfor this Court \u201cto come up with a one-size-fits-all proce\u00ad\ndural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu\u00ad\nrate\u201d benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the\nmajority\u2019s approach creates incentives for administrators\nto take \u201cone free shot\u201d at employer-favorable plan inter\u00ad\npretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the\nfirst instance with the expectation that they will have\nrepeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter\u00ad\npret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the\nmajority\u2019s \u201cone free honest mistake\u201d approach furthers\nERISA\u2019s core purpose of \u201cpromot[ing] the interests of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 85, 90\n(1983); see also, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001(b) (noting that\nERISA was enacted \u201cto protect . . . employee benefit plans\nand their beneficiaries\u201d); Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoone\njongen, 514 U.

Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985) (ERISA\nwas enacted \u201cto protect contractually defined benefits\u201d).\n   The majority does identify ERISA-related factors\u2014e.g.,\npromoting predictability and uniformity, encouraging\nemployers to adopt strong plans\u2014that it believes favor\ngiving more power to plan administrators. See ante, at 9\u2013\n13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset\nby the factors discussed above\u2014e.g., discouraging admin\u00ad\nistrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them\naggressively\u2014that argue to the contrary. At best, the\npolicies at issue\u2014some arguing in one direction, some the\nother\u2014are far less able than trust law to provide a \u201cguid\u00ad\ning principle.\u201d Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,\ntrust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to\napproach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.\nSee, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111\u2013113. And trust law\nhere, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the\ndecision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis\u00ad\ntrator\u2019s remedial opinion.\n                            III\n  Since the District Court was not required to defer to the\nAdministrator\u2019s fallback position, I should consider the\nsecond question presented, namely, whether the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the District Court\u2019s decision\nunder an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. Ante, at 4 (ac\u00ad\nknowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to\nthis question depends upon how one characterizes the\n16               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision. If the court deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s interpretation of Plan terms, then the\nCourt of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the\ndecision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,\nsupra, at 210 (\u201cAny dispute over the precise terms of the\nplan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan\u00ad\ndard\u201d). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s creation of a remedy, in significant part on\nthe basis of \u201cequitable principles,\u201d then it properly re\u00ad\nviewed the District Court decision for \u201cabuse of discre\u00ad\ntion.\u201d See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\nF. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277\nF. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere\nLife Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.\nW. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).\n   The District Court opinion contains language that sup\u00ad\nports either characterization. On the one hand, the court\nwrote that its task was to \u201cinterpret the Plan as written.\u201d\n472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said\nthat \u201cvirtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the\n[Summary Plan Description]\u201d about how to treat prior\ndistributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the\nCourt of Appeals had directed it to use \u201cequitable princi\u00ad\nples\u201d in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court appears to have used both the Plan language\nand equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See\nid., at 457\u2013459.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports\nboth characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting\nthat the District Court \u201capplied [Plan] terms\u201d in crafting\nits remedy), with id., at 117\u2013119 (describing the District\nCourt\u2019s decision as the \u201ccraft[ing]\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d and\nacknowledging that it had directed the District Court to\nuse \u201cequitable principles\u201d in doing so). But the Court of\nAppeals ultimately treated the District Court\u2019s opinion as\nif it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals opinion\u2019s language, supra, at 6 (quoting\n433 F. 3d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a\ncorrect, view. And I consequently believe the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the result for an \u201cabuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d\n   Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek\u00ad\ning relief under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), the Court of\nAppeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem\u00ad\nedy as anything other than an application of a plan\u2019s\nterms. Brief for Petitioners 55\u201356; Reply Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioners 3, and n. 8, 16\u201317. While this provision allows\nplaintiffs only to \u201cenforce\u201d or \u201cclarify\u201d rights or to \u201crecover\nbenefits\u201d \u201cunder the terms of the plan,\u201d \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\n(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court\u2019s remedial\nauthority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), \u201cCongress\nauthorized \u2018a participant or beneficiary\u2019 to bring a civil\naction . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought\nis legal or equitable\u201d). The provision thus does not pro\u00ad\nhibit a court from shaping relief through the application of\nequitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,\ne.g., 2 Third Restatement \u00a750, and Comment b, at 261\n(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7870, at\n123\u2013126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for\nexample, that an administrator provided employees with\ninadequate notice of a plan\u2019s terms (as was true here) may\nhave no alternative but to rely significantly upon those\nprinciples. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary\nmust \u201cdischarge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as\nsuch documents and instruments are consistent\u201d with\nERISA).\n   For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s contrary determination.\n18               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n              AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                    B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n                  The \u201cPhantom Account\u201d \n\n   This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative\nexample of, as I understand it, how the \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the\nfollowing assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years\nfrom 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from\nXerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of\n$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he\nworked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until\nDecember 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second\nterm of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox\u2019s con\u00ad\ntribution to John\u2019s investment account was $2,500 in 1989\n(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox\u2019s\ncontributions to John\u2019s cash and investment accounts are\nalways made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of\nreturn in John\u2019s cash and investment accounts is always 5\npercent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.\n(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe\u00ad\ntuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the\nannuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay\u00ad\nment/Annuity Rate.)\n   Given the above assumptions, John\u2019s pension upon his\nretirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 per\u00ad\ncent \u00d7 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000\n($10,500/5 percent). John\u2019s cash and investment accounts\nat the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While\nXerox\u2019s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until\n1990, each employee\u2019s opening cash account balance was\ncredited with the balance of his investment account at the\nend of 1989. The figures for John\u2019s cash account in 1989\nthus reflect the performance of his investment account. In\naddition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun\u00ad\ndred):\n                        Cite as: 559 U.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator\nwould assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu\u00ad\nlating John\u2019s pension. The Plan Administrator would also\nassume, when calculating the value of John\u2019s cash and\ninvestment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John\nhad received from Xerox had remained invested in his\naccounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would\ninclude the \u201cphantom account\u201d in his calculations. The\ntotal value of this phantom account in 1989, when John\nrejoined Xerox, is equal to John\u2019s lump-sum distribution of\n$140,000 \u00d7 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)\n   The Plan Administrator would thus compare John\u2019s\npension, column D, and column H to determine John\u2019s\nbenefit. As you can see above, column H provides the\ngreatest benefit, so John\u2019s cash account would be used to\ncalculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.\n   Second, the Plan Administrator would \u201coffset\u201d John\u2019s\nprior distribution against his current benefits to deter\u00ad\nmine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.\nThus, the Plan Administrator would take the \u201ctotal\u201d value\nof John\u2019s cash account, including the \u201cphantom account\u201d\n($277,800), and subtract out the value of the \u201cphantom\n20              CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n             AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                   B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naccount\u201d ($264,000). The total present value of the bene\u00ad\nfits John would receive upon his second retirement would\nthus be $13,800.\n   This means that John would receive approximately $690\nannually ($13,800 \u00d7 5 percent) upon retirement under the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s \u201cphantom account\u201d approach. In\ncomparison, if John had simply been treated as a new\nemployee when he was rehired, his pension would have\nentitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4\npercent \u00d7 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d may have been even more dramatic\nwith respect to some of the respondents in this case. See\nBrief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul\nFrommert erroneously received a report claiming that his\nretirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later\ndiscovering that, because of the \u201cphantom account,\u201d his\nactual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also\nApp. 63a.\n</pre>",
