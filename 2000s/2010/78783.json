ANIMALFEEDS IN-\n\n              TERNATIONAL CORP. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u20131198. Argued December 9, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nPetitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par\n  cel tankers\u2014seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately\n  chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish\n  to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur\n  suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char\n  ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi\n  tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit\n  against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated\n  with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in\n  which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling\n  that the charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con\n  sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their\n  antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a\n  class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par\n  ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree\n  ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who\n  would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American\n  Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz\n  zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter\n  mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The\n  parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as\n  the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was\n  \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the\n  arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court\n  vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators\u2019 award was\n  made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law, for had the arbitrators con\n  ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of\n2        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of\n    custom and usage. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be\n    cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of\n    custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision\n    was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra\n    tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es\n    tablished a rule against class arbitration.\nHeld: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au\n thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration\n Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq. Pp. 7\u201323.\n    (a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own\n policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de\n rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA \u00a710(a)(4)\n on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, \u201conly when\n [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the\n agreement and effectively \u2018dispense[s] his own brand of industrial\n justice,\u2019 \u201d Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.\n 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator\u2019s task is to interpret and en\n force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.\n       (2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on\n AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument for permitting class arbitration\n under the charter party\u2019s arbitration clause. However, because the\n parties agreed that their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitra\n tion issue, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was to identify the rule of law\n governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on\n post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were\n based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York\n law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a\n \u201cdefault rule\u201d permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra\n tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com\n mon-law court\u2019s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule\n for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception\n of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration\n was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its\n own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The\n panel\u2019s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any\n thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA\n \u00a710(b), this Court must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\u201d\n or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there\n can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to\n direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7\u201312.\n    (b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in\n stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclass. Pp. 12\u201317.\n      (1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which\nconcerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers\nthat had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class\narbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the\ncourt or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were \u201csilent\u201d\non the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on\nhis resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci\nsionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows\nclass arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri\nate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.\nPp. 12\u201315.\n      (2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at\ntheir arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to\nhave believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de\ncide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad\ndressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited\nhere because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra\ntion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis\nsible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have\nmisunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in\ndeciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left\nthat question open. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   (c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.\nPp. 17\u201323.\n      (1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including\nthe basic precept that arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent, not coer\ncion.\u201d Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\nU. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a \u201cwritten provision in any\nmaritime transaction\u201d calling for the arbitration of a controversy\narising out of such transaction \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and en\nforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, and permits a party to an\narbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order\ndirecting that arbitration proceed \u201cin the manner provided for in such\nagreement,\u201d \u00a74. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA\u2019s central\npurpose is to ensure that \u201cprivate agreements to arbitrate are en\nforced according to their terms.\u201d Volt, 489 U. S., at 479. Whether en\nforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,\ncourts and arbitrators must \u201cgive effect to the [parties\u2019] contractual\nrights and expectations.\u201d Ibid.

They may agree to limit the issues ar\n    bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro\n    ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their\n    disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.\n    Pp. 17\u201320.\n         (2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to\n    submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con\n    cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel\n    imposed class arbitration despite the parties\u2019 stipulation that they\n    had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d on that issue. The panel\u2019s conclusion is\n    fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi\n    tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that\n    parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra\n    tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties\u2019\n    agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,\n    84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is\n    not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an\n    agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and\n    complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.\n    Pp. 20\u201323.\n548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

In one of these,\nthe District Court for the District of Connecticut held that\nthe charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration\nunder the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen\nS. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was\npending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\nordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against\npetitioners, including AnimalFeeds\u2019 action, in the District\nof Connecticut. See In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Services\nAntitrust Litigation, 296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1\n(JPML 2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of\nthese judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners\nmust arbitrate their antitrust dispute.\n                              B\n   In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand\nfor class arbitration, designating New York City as the\nplace of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of\n\u201c[a]ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation\nservices globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils,\nacids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any\ntime during the period from August 1, 1998, to November\n30, 2002.\u201d 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental\nagreement providing for the question of class arbitration\nto be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to\n\u201cfollow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American\nArbitration Association\u2019s Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 59a.

ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n539 U. S. 444 (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with\nthe plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator,\nas a threshold matter, to determine \u201cwhether the applica\u00ad\nble arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed\non behalf of or against a class.\u201d App. 56a.\n   The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipu\u00ad\nlated that the arbitration clause was \u201csilent\u201d with respect\nto class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to\nthe arbitration panel that the term \u201csilent\u201d did not simply\nmean that the clause made no express reference to class\narbitration. Rather, he said, \u201c[a]ll the parties agree that\nwhen a contract is silent on an issue there\u2019s been no\nagreement that has been reached on that issue.\u201d Id.,\nat 77a.\n   After hearing argument and evidence, including testi\u00ad\nmony from petitioners\u2019 experts regarding arbitration\ncustoms and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators\nconcluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class\narbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other\narbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed \u201ca wide\nvariety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing\nfor class arbitration,\u201d but the panel acknowledged that\nnone of these decisions was \u201cexactly comparable\u201d to the\npresent dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a.\nPetitioners\u2019 expert evidence did not show an \u201cinten[t] to\npreclude class arbitration,\u201d the arbitrators reasoned, and\npetitioners\u2019 argument would leave \u201cno basis for a class\naction absent express agreement among all parties and\nthe putative class members.\u201d Id., at 51a.\n   The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the par\u00ad\nties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an appli\u00ad\ncation to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award in the District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York.

The District Court\nvacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators\u2019 deci\u00ad\nsion was made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law insofar\nas the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analy\u00ad\nsis. 435 F.

Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a\nfederal maritime rule of custom and usage against class\narbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not in manifest\ndisregard of federal maritime law.

See post, at 1, 3\u20136 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,\nthe dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument\n\u201cwe necessarily considered and rejected\u201d in granting certiorari. United\nStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu\u00ad\ntional considerations that implicate \u201cArticle III limitations on judicial\npower,\u201d as well as \u201cprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18\n(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial\nreview, we consider both \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u201d\nand \u201cthe hardship of withholding court consideration.\u201d National Park\nHospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).\nTo the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we\ngranted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.\nThe arbitration panel\u2019s award means that petitioners must now submit\nto class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners\nare correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the\nparties\u2019 agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class\nRule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association\nas Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what\nthey maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would\nalmost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\n143 (1974) (\u201cWhere the inevitability of the operation of a statute\nagainst certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of\na justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the\ndisputed provisions will come into effect\u201d). We think it is clear on these\nfacts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that\ntheir question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the\ndissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that\nargument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,\nn. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express\nno view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a\nquestion of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park\nHospitality Assn., supra, at 808 (\u201c[E]ven in a case raising only pruden\u00ad\ntial concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court\u2019s\nown motion\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

It is not enough for peti\u00ad\ntioners to show that the panel committed an error\u2014or\neven a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000); Paperworkers v.\nMisco, Inc., 484 U.

In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi\u00ad\ntration panel did was simply to impose its own view of\nsound policy regarding class arbitration.3\n                         B\n                         1\n  In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration pro\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We  do not decide whether \u201c \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 \u201d survives our deci\u00ad\nsion in Hall Street Associates, L.

Animal-\nFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the\narbitrators \u201cknew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this\nprinciple controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless\nwillfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar\nguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea\u00ad\nsons that follow.\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in sup-\nport of construing the arbitration clause to permit class\narbitration:\n       \u201cThe parties\u2019 arbitration clause should be construed\n    to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is si-\n    lent on the issue of class treatment and, without ex-\n    press prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under\n    Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit\n    class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)\n    the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable\n    if it forbade class arbitration.\u201d App. in No. 06\u20133474\u2013\n    cv (CA2), at A\u2013308 to A\u2013309 (emphasis added).\n   The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds\u2019 first\nargument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing\nabout the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested\nits decision on AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument.\nBecause the parties agreed their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d in\nthe sense that they had not reached any agreement on the\nissue of class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was\nto identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.\nHad they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably\nwould have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the\ntwo bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,\ni.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the\npanel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule\nof decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt\nto determine what rule would govern under either mari-\ntime or New York law in the case of a \u201csilent\u201d contract.\nInstead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbi-\ntral decisions that \u201cconstrued a wide variety of clauses in a\nwide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a.

Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among\narbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in \u201ca wide\nvariety of settings,\u201d the panel considered only whether\nthere was any good reason not to follow that consensus in\nthis case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a. The panel was\nnot persuaded by \u201ccourt cases denying consolidation of\narbitrations,\u201d5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party had \u201cnever been the basis of a class action,\u201d\nor by expert opinion that \u201csophisticated, multinational\ncommercial parties of the type that are sought to be in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The panel\u2019s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the\n\npanel\u2019s decision was not based on a determination regarding the\nparties\u2019 intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA\u2019s\nClass Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available\nwhen the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during\nthe class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2\n2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the\npanel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that \u201c[w]hen you talk about\nexpectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were\nthe subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So\ntherefore, if you are going to talk about the parties\u2019 intentions, pre\n[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are\ncommon.\u201d App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to\nacknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a\ncontract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 50a.\n  5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,\n\n74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189\nF. 3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269,\n275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the\narbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when\nthey entered into their contracts.\n10     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncluded in the class would never intend that the arbitration\nclauses would permit a class arbitration.\u201d6 Id., at 50a\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime\n\narbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business\nfor parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See,\ne.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (\u201cIn the 30 years I\nhave been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered\nan arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as\nallowing class action arbitration\u201d); id., at 139a (expert declaration of\nBruce Harris) (\u201cI have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty\nyears and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the\nissue of a class action arbitration has even been raised\u201d). These experts\namplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,\ne.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class\naction in a maritime arbitration would be \u201cquite foreign\u201d to overseas\nshipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a\u2013112a (Mr. Harris)\n(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra\u00ad\ntion, class arbitration is \u201cinconceivable\u201d).\n   Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of\n\u201ccustom and usage\u201d is relevant to determining the parties\u2019 intent when\nan express agreement is ambiguous.

Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for depart\u00ad\ning from the post-Bazzle arbitral consensus, the panel held\nthat class arbitration was permitted in this case. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a. The conclusion is inescapable that the\npanel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.7\n                              2\n  It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references\nto intent, but none of these shows that the panel did any\u00ad\nthing other than impose its own policy preference. The\nopinion states that, under Bazzle, \u201carbitrators must look\nto the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention whether they intended to permit or to\npreclude class action,\u201d and the panel added that \u201c[t]his is\nalso consistent with New York law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. But the panel had no occasion to \u201cascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention\u201d in the present case because the parties\nwere in complete agreement regarding their intent. In the\nvery next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncustoms\u201d and the \u201ccustom of the sea . . . includes a customary interpre\u00ad\ntation of contract language\u201d).\n   7 The dissent calls this conclusion \u201chardly fair,\u201d noting that the word\n\n\u201c \u2018policy\u2019 is not so much as mentioned in the arbitrators\u2019 award.\u201d Post,\nat 8. But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators\nneed not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the\nhearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized\nthat the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds\nrelied involved \u201cessentially consumer non-value cases.\u201d App. 82a. In\nresponse, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those\nawards by asserting that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the claimants against\npetitioners \u201chave negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to\nlitigate than you would get if you won.\u201d Id., at 82a\u201383a. The panel\ncredited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not\ndemonstrated the parties\u2019 intent to preclude class arbitration, and\nfurther observed that if petitioners\u2019 anticonsolidation precedents\ncontrolled, then \u201cthere would appear to be no basis for a class action\nabsent express agreement among all parties and the putative class\nmembers.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the\nVegoilvoy charter party was \u201csilent on whether [it] per\u00ad\nmit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,\u201d but that the\ncharter party was \u201cnot ambiguous so as to call for parol\nevidence.\u201d Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in\u00ad\nquiry regarding the parties\u2019 intent, and any inquiry into\nthat settled question would have been outside the panel\u2019s\nassigned task.\n   The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan\u00ad\nguage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but\nsince the only task that was left for the panel, in light of\nthe parties\u2019 stipulation, was to identify the governing rule\napplicable in a case in which neither the language of the\ncontract nor any other evidence established that the par\u00ad\nties had reached any agreement on the question of class\narbitration, the particular wording of the charter party\nwas quite beside the point.\n   In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of\ndecision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New\nYork law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy\nchoice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under\n\u00a710(b) of the FAA, we must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by\nthe arbitrators\u201d or decide the question that was originally\nreferred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can\nbe only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see\nno need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle \u201ccontrolled\u201d\nthe \u201cresolution\u201d of the question whether the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party \u201cpermit[s] this arbitration to proceed on\nbehalf of a class,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a, but that\nunderstanding was incorrect.\n  Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender\n(Green Tree) and its customers.

Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted\nclass arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the\ncustomers.\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the\nawards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.\n244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Sev-\nenth Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority\nto order classwide arbitration under \u00a74 of the FAA, see\nChamp v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and\nconflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior\nCourt of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P. 2d 1192\n(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the\nCalifornia approach, which it characterized as permitting\na trial court to \u201corder class-wide arbitration under adhe-\nsive but enforceable franchise contracts,\u201d 351 S. C., at 259,\n266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the\nSouth Carolina court observed, a trial judge must\n\u201c[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies\u201d of\nrequiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual\nbasis against \u201cresulting prejudice to the drafting party\u201d\nand should take into account factors such as \u201cefficiency\u201d\nand \u201cequity.\u201d Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,\nand n. 15.\n   Applying these standards to the case before it, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause\nin the Green Tree contracts was \u201csilent regarding class-\nwide arbitration.\u201d Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as\nfollows:\n    \u201c[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be or-\n    dered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it\n    would serve efficiency and equity, and would not re-\n    sult in prejudice.

ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting\n     party could effectively prevent class actions against\n     it without having to say it was doing so in the\n     agreement.\u201d Id., at 266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 360 (footnote\n     omitted).\n   When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale\ncommanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who\njoined the judgment\u2014that is, the plurality opinion and\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion\u2014collectively addressed three\nseparate questions. The first was which decision maker\n(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts\nin question were \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of class arbitration.\nThe second was what standard the appropriate decision\nmaker should apply in determining whether a contract\nallows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA\nentirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit\nclass arbitration only under limited circumstances, such\nas when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this\nquestion left entirely to state law?) The final question was\nwhether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class\narbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.\n   The plurality opinion decided only the first question,\nconcluding that the arbitrator and not a court should\ndecide whether the contracts were indeed \u201csilent\u201d on the\nissue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, \u201c[i]n\ncertain limited circumstances,\u201d involving \u201cgateway mat\u00ad\nters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration\nagreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra\u00ad\ntion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,\u201d it is\nassumed \u201cthat the parties intended courts, not arbitra\u00ad\ntors,\u201d to make the decision. 539 U.

Id., at 455 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part).

But because he\ndid not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of\nthe appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach\nthat question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci\u00ad\nsion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that \u201cthe\ndecision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct\nas a matter of law.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by\u00ad\npassed the first question noted above and rested instead\non his resolution of the second and third questions.

For one thing, the parties appear to have\nbelieved that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra\u00ad\ntor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class\narbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before\narbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: \u201cWhat\n[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is\nleft up to the arbitrator, that\u2019s the rule in [Bazzle]\u201d).

The arbitration panel began its discussion\nby stating that the parties \u201cdiffer regarding the rule of\ninterpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel\ncontinued:\n     \u201cClaimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language\n     that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\n     action.

The\nquestion that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was\nwhether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed\nfor class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement\nconferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter\nparty itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds\u2019 argument, these state\u00ad\nments show that petitioners did not waive their argument that Bazzle\ndid not establish the standard for the decision maker to apply when\nconstruing an arbitration clause.\n   9 See generally Sturges & Murphy, Some Confusing Matters Relating\n\nto Arbitration Under the United States Arbitration Act, 17 Law &\nContemp.

It falls to courts and\narbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,\nand when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose\nsight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.\n                              B\n   From these principles, it follows that a party may not be\ncompelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitra\u00ad\ntion panel imposed class arbitration even though the\nparties concurred that they had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d\non that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view\nof the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not \u201ces\u00ad\ntablish that the parties to the charter agreements in\u00ad\ntended to preclude class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n51a.

The\npanel\u2019s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun\u00ad\ndational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of\nconsent.\n   In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that\nparties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly\nauthorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement. Thus,\nwe have said that \u201c \u2018 \u201cprocedural\u201d questions which grow out\nof the dispute and bear on its final disposition\u2019 are pre\u00ad\nsumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to\ndecide.\u201d Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.\n79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\nLivingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is\ngrounded in the background principle that \u201c[w]hen the\nparties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract\nhave not agreed with respect to a term which is essential\nto a determination of their rights and duties, a term which\nis reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the\ncourt.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7204 (1979).\n   An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra\u00ad\ntion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\nsolely from the fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\nThis is so because class-action arbitration changes the\nnature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be\npresumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi\u00ad\ntration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency\nand speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to\nresolve specialized disputes.        See Gilmer v. Inter\nstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31 (1991); Mitsu\nbishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 628; see also 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed\u00ad\nupon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a\nsingle dispute between the parties to a single agreement,\nbut instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or\nperhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (\u201c[W]e\nbelieve domestic class members could be in the hundreds\u201d\nand that \u201c[t]here could be class members that ship to and\nfrom the U.

E. 2d, at 352\u2013353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals\nthat was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than\n$14 million by a single arbitrator).

The arbitrator\u2019s award no\nlonger purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra\u00ad\ntion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par\u00ad\nties as well. Cf. Ortiz v.

We\nthink that the differences between bilateral and class\u00ad\naction arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,\nconsistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that\nthe parties\u2019 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi\u00ad\ntration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in\nclass proceedings.10\n   The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by\ncharacterizing the question before the arbitrators as being\nmerely what \u201cprocedural mode\u201d was available to present\nAnimalFeeds\u2019 claims. Post, at 9. If the question were that\nsimple, there would be no need to consider the parties\u2019\nintent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam,\nsupra, at 84 (committing \u201cprocedural questions\u201d presump\u00ad\ntively to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to\nthe dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz\u00ad\ning the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques\u00ad\ntion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class\narbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there\nwas \u201cno agreement\u201d on this question, it follows that the\nparties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to\nclass arbitration.\n                             V\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed\u00ad\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 We have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support\na finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\nHere, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was \u201cno agreement\u201d on\nthe issue of class-action arbitration.

Recall that the\nparties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide, initially,\nwhether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts\npermitted class proceedings. See supra, at 2. The panel\ndid just what it was commissioned to do. It construed the\nbroad arbitration clause (covering \u201c[a]ny dispute arising\nfrom the making, performance or termination of this\nCharter Party,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled,\nexpressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbi\ntration. The Court acts without warrant in allowing Stolt-\nNielsen essentially to repudiate its submission of the\ncontract-construction issue to the arbitration panel, and to\ngain, in place of the arbitrators\u2019 judgment, this Court\u2019s de\nnovo determination.\n                            A\n    The controlling FAA prescription, \u00a710(a),8 authorizes a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The parties agreed that the arbitrators would issue a \u201cpartial final\n\naward,\u201d and then \u201cstay all proceedings . . . to permit any party to move\na court of competent jurisdiction to confirm or to vacate\u201d the award.\nApp. 56a.

See ibid. The question,\nhowever, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu\nlation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a\nspecies of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. Alberto-\nCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties\nhad chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of\n\u201cany dispute\u201d involving a contract for ocean carriage of\ngoods. There is little question that the designated court,\nstate or federal, would have authority to conduct claims\nlike AnimalFeeds\u2019 on a class basis. Why should the class\naction prospect vanish when the \u201cany dispute\u201d clause is\ncontained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut\nGeneral Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,\n210 F. 3d 771, 774\u2013776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract\u2019s\nauthorization to arbitrate \u201c[a]ny dispute\u201d to permit con\nsolidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi\ntrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro\nceedings, see ante, at 21\u201322, then the claimant should\nretain its right to proceed in that format in court.\n                               B\n   When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no\nmore than modest in size, class proceedings may be \u201cthe\nthing,\u201d i.e., without them, potential claimants will have\nlittle, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617\n(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int\u2019l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,\n661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe realistic alternative to a class action\nis not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,\nas only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\u201d). Mindful that\ndisallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the\ndimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can\nmount, I note some stopping points in the Court\u2019s decision.\n   First, the Court does not insist on express consent to\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Class arbitration may be ordered if\n\u201cthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies] agreed\u201d \u201cto submit to class arbitration\u201d. Ante, at\n20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (\u201cWe have no occasion to decide\nwhat contractual basis may support a finding that the\nparties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\u201d).\nSecond, by observing that \u201cthe parties [here] are sophisti\ncated business entities,\u201d and \u201cthat it is customary for the\nshipper to choose the charter party that is used for a\nparticular shipment,\u201d the Court apparently spares from its\naffirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe\nsion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.\nWhile these qualifications limit the scope of the Court\u2019s\ndecision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators\u2019 judg\nment should not have been disturbed.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition\nfor want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.

Argued December 9, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nPetitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par\n  cel tankers\u2014seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately\n  chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish\n  to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur\n  suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char\n  ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi\n  tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit\n  against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated\n  with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in\n  which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling\n  that the charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con\n  sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their\n  antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a\n  class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par\n  ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree\n  ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who\n  would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American\n  Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz\n  zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter\n  mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The\n  parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as\n  the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was\n  \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the\n  arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court\n  vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators\u2019 award was\n  made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law, for had the arbitrators con\n  ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of\n2        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of\n    custom and usage. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be\n    cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of\n    custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision\n    was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra\n    tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es\n    tablished a rule against class arbitration.\nHeld: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au\n thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration\n Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq. Pp. 7\u201323.\n    (a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own\n policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de\n rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA \u00a710(a)(4)\n on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, \u201conly when\n [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the\n agreement and effectively \u2018dispense[s] his own brand of industrial\n justice,\u2019 \u201d Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.\n 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator\u2019s task is to interpret and en\n force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.\n       (2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on\n AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument for permitting class arbitration\n under the charter party\u2019s arbitration clause. However, because the\n parties agreed that their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitra\n tion issue, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was to identify the rule of law\n governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on\n post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were\n based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York\n law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a\n \u201cdefault rule\u201d permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra\n tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com\n mon-law court\u2019s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule\n for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception\n of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration\n was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its\n own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The\n panel\u2019s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any\n thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA\n \u00a710(b), this Court must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\u201d\n or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there\n can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to\n direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7\u201312.\n    (b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in\n stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclass. Pp. 12\u201317.\n      (1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which\nconcerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers\nthat had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class\narbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the\ncourt or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were \u201csilent\u201d\non the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on\nhis resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci\nsionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows\nclass arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri\nate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.\nPp. 12\u201315.\n      (2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at\ntheir arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to\nhave believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de\ncide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad\ndressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited\nhere because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra\ntion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis\nsible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have\nmisunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in\ndeciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left\nthat question open. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   (c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.\nPp. 17\u201323.\n      (1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including\nthe basic precept that arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent, not coer\ncion.\u201d Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\nU. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a \u201cwritten provision in any\nmaritime transaction\u201d calling for the arbitration of a controversy\narising out of such transaction \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and en\nforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, and permits a party to an\narbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order\ndirecting that arbitration proceed \u201cin the manner provided for in such\nagreement,\u201d \u00a74. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA\u2019s central\npurpose is to ensure that \u201cprivate agreements to arbitrate are en\nforced according to their terms.\u201d Volt, 489 U. S., at 479. Whether en\nforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,\ncourts and arbitrators must \u201cgive effect to the [parties\u2019] contractual\nrights and expectations.\u201d Ibid.

They may agree to limit the issues ar\n    bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro\n    ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their\n    disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.\n    Pp. 17\u201320.\n         (2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to\n    submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con\n    cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel\n    imposed class arbitration despite the parties\u2019 stipulation that they\n    had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d on that issue. The panel\u2019s conclusion is\n    fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi\n    tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that\n    parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra\n    tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties\u2019\n    agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,\n    84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is\n    not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an\n    agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and\n    complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.\n    Pp. 20\u201323.\n548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

The parties entered into a supplemental\nagreement providing for the question of class arbitration\nto be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to\n\u201cfollow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American\nArbitration Association\u2019s Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 59a.

Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to\nthe arbitration panel that the term \u201csilent\u201d did not simply\nmean that the clause made no express reference to class\narbitration. Rather, he said, \u201c[a]ll the parties agree that\nwhen a contract is silent on an issue there\u2019s been no\nagreement that has been reached on that issue.\u201d Id.,\nat 77a.\n   After hearing argument and evidence, including testi\u00ad\nmony from petitioners\u2019 experts regarding arbitration\ncustoms and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators\nconcluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class\narbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other\narbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed \u201ca wide\nvariety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing\nfor class arbitration,\u201d but the panel acknowledged that\nnone of these decisions was \u201cexactly comparable\u201d to the\npresent dispute.

C. \u00a716(a)(1)(E) (\u201cAn appeal may be\ntaken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award\u201d). As an\ninitial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the \u201cmani\u00ad\nfest disregard\u201d standard survived our decision in Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.

Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a\nfederal maritime rule of custom and usage against class\narbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not in manifest\ndisregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97\u201398. Nor had\nthe arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the\nCourt of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York\n6        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

See post, at 1, 3\u20136 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,\nthe dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument\n\u201cwe necessarily considered and rejected\u201d in granting certiorari. United\nStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu\u00ad\ntional considerations that implicate \u201cArticle III limitations on judicial\npower,\u201d as well as \u201cprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18\n(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial\nreview, we consider both \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u201d\nand \u201cthe hardship of withholding court consideration.\u201d National Park\nHospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).\nTo the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we\ngranted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.\nThe arbitration panel\u2019s award means that petitioners must now submit\nto class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners\nare correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the\nparties\u2019 agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class\nRule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association\nas Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what\nthey maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would\nalmost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\n143 (1974) (\u201cWhere the inevitability of the operation of a statute\nagainst certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of\na justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the\ndisputed provisions will come into effect\u201d). We think it is clear on these\nfacts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that\ntheir question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the\ndissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that\nargument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,\nn. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express\nno view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a\nquestion of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park\nHospitality Assn., supra, at 808 (\u201c[E]ven in a case raising only pruden\u00ad\ntial concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court\u2019s\nown motion\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

It is not enough for peti\u00ad\ntioners to show that the panel committed an error\u2014or\neven a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U.

In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi\u00ad\ntration panel did was simply to impose its own view of\nsound policy regarding class arbitration.3\n                         B\n                         1\n  In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration pro\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We  do not decide whether \u201c \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 \u201d survives our deci\u00ad\nsion in Hall Street Associates, L.

Animal-\nFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the\narbitrators \u201cknew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this\nprinciple controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless\nwillfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar\nguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea\u00ad\nsons that follow.\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in sup-\nport of construing the arbitration clause to permit class\narbitration:\n       \u201cThe parties\u2019 arbitration clause should be construed\n    to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is si-\n    lent on the issue of class treatment and, without ex-\n    press prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under\n    Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit\n    class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)\n    the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable\n    if it forbade class arbitration.\u201d App. in No. 06\u20133474\u2013\n    cv (CA2), at A\u2013308 to A\u2013309 (emphasis added).\n   The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds\u2019 first\nargument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing\nabout the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested\nits decision on AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument.\nBecause the parties agreed their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d in\nthe sense that they had not reached any agreement on the\nissue of class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was\nto identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.\nHad they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably\nwould have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the\ntwo bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,\ni.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the\npanel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule\nof decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt\nto determine what rule would govern under either mari-\ntime or New York law in the case of a \u201csilent\u201d contract.\nInstead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbi-\ntral decisions that \u201cconstrued a wide variety of clauses in a\nwide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a.

S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.4\n   Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law,\nor New York law contains a \u201cdefault rule\u201d under which an\narbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitra\u00ad\ntion in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded\nas if it had the authority of a common-law court to develop\nwhat it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a\nsituation. Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among\narbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in \u201ca wide\nvariety of settings,\u201d the panel considered only whether\nthere was any good reason not to follow that consensus in\nthis case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a. The panel was\nnot persuaded by \u201ccourt cases denying consolidation of\narbitrations,\u201d5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party had \u201cnever been the basis of a class action,\u201d\nor by expert opinion that \u201csophisticated, multinational\ncommercial parties of the type that are sought to be in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The panel\u2019s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the\n\npanel\u2019s decision was not based on a determination regarding the\nparties\u2019 intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA\u2019s\nClass Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available\nwhen the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during\nthe class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2\n2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the\npanel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that \u201c[w]hen you talk about\nexpectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were\nthe subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So\ntherefore, if you are going to talk about the parties\u2019 intentions, pre\n[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are\ncommon.\u201d App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to\nacknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a\ncontract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 50a.\n  5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,\n\n74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189\nF. 3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269,\n275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the\narbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when\nthey entered into their contracts.\n10     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncluded in the class would never intend that the arbitration\nclauses would permit a class arbitration.\u201d6 Id., at 50a\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime\n\narbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business\nfor parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See,\ne.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (\u201cIn the 30 years I\nhave been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered\nan arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as\nallowing class action arbitration\u201d); id., at 139a (expert declaration of\nBruce Harris) (\u201cI have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty\nyears and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the\nissue of a class action arbitration has even been raised\u201d). These experts\namplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,\ne.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class\naction in a maritime arbitration would be \u201cquite foreign\u201d to overseas\nshipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a\u2013112a (Mr. Harris)\n(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra\u00ad\ntion, class arbitration is \u201cinconceivable\u201d).\n   Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of\n\u201ccustom and usage\u201d is relevant to determining the parties\u2019 intent when\nan express agreement is ambiguous.

Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for depart\u00ad\ning from the post-Bazzle arbitral consensus, the panel held\nthat class arbitration was permitted in this case. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a. The conclusion is inescapable that the\npanel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.7\n                              2\n  It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references\nto intent, but none of these shows that the panel did any\u00ad\nthing other than impose its own policy preference. The\nopinion states that, under Bazzle, \u201carbitrators must look\nto the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention whether they intended to permit or to\npreclude class action,\u201d and the panel added that \u201c[t]his is\nalso consistent with New York law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. But the panel had no occasion to \u201cascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention\u201d in the present case because the parties\nwere in complete agreement regarding their intent. In the\nvery next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncustoms\u201d and the \u201ccustom of the sea . . . includes a customary interpre\u00ad\ntation of contract language\u201d).\n   7 The dissent calls this conclusion \u201chardly fair,\u201d noting that the word\n\n\u201c \u2018policy\u2019 is not so much as mentioned in the arbitrators\u2019 award.\u201d Post,\nat 8. But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators\nneed not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the\nhearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized\nthat the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds\nrelied involved \u201cessentially consumer non-value cases.\u201d App. 82a. In\nresponse, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those\nawards by asserting that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the claimants against\npetitioners \u201chave negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to\nlitigate than you would get if you won.\u201d Id., at 82a\u201383a. The panel\ncredited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not\ndemonstrated the parties\u2019 intent to preclude class arbitration, and\nfurther observed that if petitioners\u2019 anticonsolidation precedents\ncontrolled, then \u201cthere would appear to be no basis for a class action\nabsent express agreement among all parties and the putative class\nmembers.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the\nVegoilvoy charter party was \u201csilent on whether [it] per\u00ad\nmit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,\u201d but that the\ncharter party was \u201cnot ambiguous so as to call for parol\nevidence.\u201d Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in\u00ad\nquiry regarding the parties\u2019 intent, and any inquiry into\nthat settled question would have been outside the panel\u2019s\nassigned task.\n   The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan\u00ad\nguage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but\nsince the only task that was left for the panel, in light of\nthe parties\u2019 stipulation, was to identify the governing rule\napplicable in a case in which neither the language of the\ncontract nor any other evidence established that the par\u00ad\nties had reached any agreement on the question of class\narbitration, the particular wording of the charter party\nwas quite beside the point.\n   In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of\ndecision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New\nYork law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy\nchoice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under\n\u00a710(b) of the FAA, we must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by\nthe arbitrators\u201d or decide the question that was originally\nreferred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can\nbe only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see\nno need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle \u201ccontrolled\u201d\nthe \u201cresolution\u201d of the question whether the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party \u201cpermit[s] this arbitration to proceed on\nbehalf of a class,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a, but that\nunderstanding was incorrect.\n  Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender\n(Green Tree) and its customers.

The opinions of the Justices who\njoined the judgment\u2014that is, the plurality opinion and\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion\u2014collectively addressed three\nseparate questions. The first was which decision maker\n(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts\nin question were \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of class arbitration.\nThe second was what standard the appropriate decision\nmaker should apply in determining whether a contract\nallows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA\nentirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit\nclass arbitration only under limited circumstances, such\nas when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this\nquestion left entirely to state law?) The final question was\nwhether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class\narbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.\n   The plurality opinion decided only the first question,\nconcluding that the arbitrator and not a court should\ndecide whether the contracts were indeed \u201csilent\u201d on the\nissue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, \u201c[i]n\ncertain limited circumstances,\u201d involving \u201cgateway mat\u00ad\nters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration\nagreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra\u00ad\ntion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,\u201d it is\nassumed \u201cthat the parties intended courts, not arbitra\u00ad\ntors,\u201d to make the decision. 539 U.

Id., at 455 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did\nnot take a definitive position on the first question, stating\nonly that \u201c[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties\u2019\nagreement should have been made in the first instance by\nthe arbitrator.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he\ndid not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of\nthe appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach\nthat question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci\u00ad\nsion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that \u201cthe\ndecision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct\nas a matter of law.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by\u00ad\npassed the first question noted above and rested instead\non his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,\nBazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three\nquestions.\n                              B\n   Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have\nbaffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitra\u00ad\ntion proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have\nbelieved that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra\u00ad\ntor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class\narbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before\narbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: \u201cWhat\n[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is\nleft up to the arbitrator, that\u2019s the rule in [Bazzle]\u201d).

ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfact, however, only the plurality decided that question.\nBut we need not revisit that question here because the\nparties\u2019 supplemental agreement expressly assigned this\nissue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that\nthis assignment was impermissible.\n  Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbi-\ntration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in an-\nother respect, namely, that it established the standard to\nbe applied by a decision maker in determining whether a\ncontract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class\narbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion\nby stating that the parties \u201cdiffer regarding the rule of\ninterpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel\ncontinued:\n     \u201cClaimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language\n     that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\n     action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents\n     that the test is a more general one\u2014arbitrators must\n     look to the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to as-\n     certain the parties\u2019 intention whether they intended to\n     permit or to preclude class action.\u201d Ibid.\nAs we have explained, however, Bazzle did not establish\nthe rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration\nis permitted.8 The decision in Bazzle left that question\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 AnimalFeeds   invokes the parties\u2019 supplemental agreement as evi-\ndence that petitioners \u201cwaived\u201d any claim that the arbitrators could not\nconstrue the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration.

The\nquestion that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was\nwhether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed\nfor class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement\nconferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter\nparty itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds\u2019 argument, these state\u00ad\nments show that petitioners did not waive their argument that Bazzle\ndid not establish the standard for the decision maker to apply when\nconstruing an arbitration clause.\n   9 See generally Sturges & Murphy, Some Confusing Matters Relating\n\nto Arbitration Under the United States Arbitration Act, 17 Law &\nContemp.

It falls to courts and\narbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,\nand when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose\nsight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.\n                              B\n   From these principles, it follows that a party may not be\ncompelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitra\u00ad\ntion panel imposed class arbitration even though the\nparties concurred that they had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d\non that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view\nof the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not \u201ces\u00ad\ntablish that the parties to the charter agreements in\u00ad\ntended to preclude class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n51a.

The\npanel\u2019s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun\u00ad\ndational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of\nconsent.\n   In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that\nparties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly\nauthorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement. Thus,\nwe have said that \u201c \u2018 \u201cprocedural\u201d questions which grow out\nof the dispute and bear on its final disposition\u2019 are pre\u00ad\nsumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to\ndecide.\u201d Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.\n79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\nLivingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is\ngrounded in the background principle that \u201c[w]hen the\nparties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract\nhave not agreed with respect to a term which is essential\nto a determination of their rights and duties, a term which\nis reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the\ncourt.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7204 (1979).\n   An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra\u00ad\ntion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\nsolely from the fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\nThis is so because class-action arbitration changes the\nnature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be\npresumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi\u00ad\ntration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency\nand speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to\nresolve specialized disputes.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed\u00ad\nupon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a\nsingle dispute between the parties to a single agreement,\nbut instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or\nperhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (\u201c[W]e\nbelieve domestic class members could be in the hundreds\u201d\nand that \u201c[t]here could be class members that ship to and\nfrom the U.

The arbitrator\u2019s award no\nlonger purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra\u00ad\ntion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par\u00ad\nties as well. Cf. Ortiz v.

We\nthink that the differences between bilateral and class\u00ad\naction arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,\nconsistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that\nthe parties\u2019 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi\u00ad\ntration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in\nclass proceedings.10\n   The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by\ncharacterizing the question before the arbitrators as being\nmerely what \u201cprocedural mode\u201d was available to present\nAnimalFeeds\u2019 claims.

See Howsam,\nsupra, at 84 (committing \u201cprocedural questions\u201d presump\u00ad\ntively to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to\nthe dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz\u00ad\ning the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques\u00ad\ntion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class\narbitration.

That court\naction terminated when the Second Circuit held, first, that\nthe parties\u2019 transactions were governed by contracts (char\nter parties) with enforceable arbitration clauses, and\nsecond, that the antitrust claims were arbitrable.

Their\ndecision that the charter-party arbitration clause permit\nted class arbitration was abstract and highly interlocu\ntory. The panel did not decide whether the particular\nclaims AnimalFeeds advanced were suitable for class\nresolution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a; much less\ndid it delineate any class or consider whether, \u201cif a class is\ncertified, . . . members of the putative class should be\nrequired to \u2018opt in\u2019 to th[e] proceeding,\u201d id., at 52a.\n   The Court, ante, at 6, n. 2, does not persuasively justify\njudicial intervention so early in the game or convincingly\nreconcile its adjudication with the firm final-judgment\nrule prevailing in the federal court system.

It would be better to\nminimize the number of occasions the parties to arbitra\ntion can come to court; on the whole, this benefits the\nparties, the arbitration process and the courts.\u201d).\n   While lower court opinions are thus divided, this much\nis plain: No decision of this Court, until today, has ever\napproved immediate judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s\ndecision as preliminary as the \u201cpartial award\u201d made in\nthis case.7\n                             III\n  Even if Stolt-Nielsen had a plea ripe for judicial review,\nthe Court should reject it on the merits. Recall that the\nparties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide, initially,\nwhether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts\npermitted class proceedings. See supra, at 2. The panel\ndid just what it was commissioned to do. It construed the\nbroad arbitration clause (covering \u201c[a]ny dispute arising\nfrom the making, performance or termination of this\nCharter Party,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled,\nexpressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbi\ntration. The Court acts without warrant in allowing Stolt-\nNielsen essentially to repudiate its submission of the\ncontract-construction issue to the arbitration panel, and to\ngain, in place of the arbitrators\u2019 judgment, this Court\u2019s de\nnovo determination.\n                            A\n    The controlling FAA prescription, \u00a710(a),8 authorizes a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The parties agreed that the arbitrators would issue a \u201cpartial final\n\naward,\u201d and then \u201cstay all proceedings . . . to permit any party to move\na court of competent jurisdiction to confirm or to vacate\u201d the award.\nApp. 56a.

But arbitrators, in delineating an\nappropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard\nsuch contractual constraints. In this case, for example,\nAnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only\n\u201cclaims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]\n. . . that provides for arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the\nproposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of\npersons \u201cwith whom\u201d Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,\nand only \u201cissues\u201d subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em\nphasis omitted).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,\n\nclass arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not\nfeasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev\nable. See, e.g., In re American Express Merchants\u2019 Litigation, 554 F. 3d\n300, 315\u2013316, 320 (CA2 2009); Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F. 3d 25,\n55, 59 (CA1 2006); Discover Bank v.

Were there no right to proceed on\nbehalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or\nwaiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re\nquirement to the parties\u2019 right to stipulate rules under\nwhich arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,\nhowever, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu\nlation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a\nspecies of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. Alberto-\nCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties\nhad chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of\n\u201cany dispute\u201d involving a contract for ocean carriage of\ngoods. There is little question that the designated court,\nstate or federal, would have authority to conduct claims\nlike AnimalFeeds\u2019 on a class basis. Why should the class\naction prospect vanish when the \u201cany dispute\u201d clause is\ncontained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut\nGeneral Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,\n210 F. 3d 771, 774\u2013776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract\u2019s\nauthorization to arbitrate \u201c[a]ny dispute\u201d to permit con\nsolidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi\ntrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro\nceedings, see ante, at 21\u201322, then the claimant should\nretain its right to proceed in that format in court.\n                               B\n   When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no\nmore than modest in size, class proceedings may be \u201cthe\nthing,\u201d i.e., without them, potential claimants will have\nlittle, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617\n(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int\u2019l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,\n661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe realistic alternative to a class action\nis not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,\nas only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\u201d). Mindful that\ndisallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the\ndimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can\nmount, I note some stopping points in the Court\u2019s decision.\n   First, the Court does not insist on express consent to\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nclass arbitration. Class arbitration may be ordered if\n\u201cthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies] agreed\u201d \u201cto submit to class arbitration\u201d. Ante, at\n20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (\u201cWe have no occasion to decide\nwhat contractual basis may support a finding that the\nparties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\u201d).\nSecond, by observing that \u201cthe parties [here] are sophisti\ncated business entities,\u201d and \u201cthat it is customary for the\nshipper to choose the charter party that is used for a\nparticular shipment,\u201d the Court apparently spares from its\naffirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe\nsion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.\nWhile these qualifications limit the scope of the Court\u2019s\ndecision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators\u2019 judg\nment should not have been disturbed.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition\nfor want of a controversy ripe for judicial review. Were I\nto reach the merits, I would affirm the Second Circuit\u2019s\njudgment confirming the arbitrators\u2019 clause-construction\ndecision.\n</pre>",
