Argued November 30, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac\n tion under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging\n that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart\n attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com\n plaint is timely if filed no more than “2 years after the discovery of\n the facts constituting the violation” or 5 years after the violation. 28\n U. S. C. §1658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un\n timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil\n ity of Merck’s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than\n 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under\n take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the\n relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 “VIGOR” study com\n paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car\n diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to\n the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm\n caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let\n ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck’s\n Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was “false,\n lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading”; and (3) pleadings\n filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al\n leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten\n tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding\n that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted\n with scienter, an element of a §10(b) violation, and consequently did\n not commence the running of the limitations period.\nHeld:\n    1. The limitations period in §1658(b)(1) begins to run once the\n plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n2                      MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    have “discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation”—whichever\n    comes first. In the statute of limitations context, “discovery” is often\n    used as a term of art in connection with the “discovery rule,” a doc\n    trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has\n    “discovered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by\n    state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures\n    have sometimes codified this rule. When “discovery” is written di\n    rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re\n    fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery\n    of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in\n    tended courts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) simi\n    larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov\n    erning limitations period for private §10(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,\n    Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding\n    that such actions “must be commenced within one year after the dis\n    covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,” id., at 364 (empha\n    sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have\n    held that “discovery” occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers\n    the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n    have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf’s critical\n    language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,\n    when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece\n    dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–\n    117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use\n    of “discovery” in the limitations context generally as well as in this\n    provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly\n    strong here. Merck’s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8–12.\n       2. In determining the time at which “discovery” occurs, terms such\n    as “inquiry notice” and “storm warnings” may be useful insofar as\n    they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona\n    bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe\n    riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a\n    reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered “the facts consti\n    tuting the violation,” including scienter—irrespective of whether the\n    actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n    Pp. 12–17.\n          (a) Contrary to Merck’s argument, facts showing scienter are\n    among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” Scienter is assuredly a\n    “fact.” In a §10(b) action, it refers to “a mental state embracing in\n    tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n    425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and “constitut[es]” an important and neces\n    sary element of a §10(b) “violation.” See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues\n    & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. Because the scienter element of\n    §10(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2), unless a §10(b) complaint sets out facts\nshowing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with\nthe relevant intent, the claim will fail. It would frustrate the very\npurpose of the discovery rule codified in §1658(b)(1) if the limitations\nperiod began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had “dis\ncover[ed]” any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12–14.\n     (b) The Court also rejects Merck’s argument that, even if “discov\nery” requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate\nrially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi\nnarily sufficient to show scienter. Where §10(b) is at issue, the\nrelation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.\nFor instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm’s future earnings,\nby itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber\nately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, “discovery” of additional\nscienter-related facts may be required. The statute’s inclusion of an\nunqualified bar on actions instituted “5 years after such violation,”\n§1658(b)(2), should diminish Merck’s fear that this requirement will\ngive life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts\ntaken long ago. P. 14.\n     (c) And the Court cannot accept Merck’s argument that the limi\ntations period begins at “inquiry notice,” meaning the point where\nthe facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur\nther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the\nplaintiff would already have “discover[ed]” facts showing scienter or\nother “facts constituting the violation.” The statute says that the\nplaintiff’s claim accrues only after the “discovery” of those latter\nfacts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some\ntimes begin before “discovery” can take place. Merck also argues that\ndetermining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave “discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for judges\nto undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have\nlong had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this\nkind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14–17.\n  3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered, “the facts constituting the violation.” The FDA’s Septem\nber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here\nrelevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy\npothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy\npothesis as a “possible explanation” for the VIGOR results, faulting\nMerck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al\nternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com\nplaints’ general statements about Merck’s state of mind show little\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    more. Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-\n    November 2001 circumstances reveal “facts” indicating the relevant\n    scienter.

RICHARD\n               REYNOLDS ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 27, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns the timeliness of a complaint filed in\na private securities fraud action. The complaint was\ntimely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs\n“discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.” 28\nU. S. C. §1658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute\nfor the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)\nwhen the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea\nsonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts\nconstituting the violation”—whichever comes first. We\nalso hold that the “facts constituting the violation” include\nthe fact of scienter, “a mental state embracing intent to\ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this\nstandard, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination\nthat the complaint filed here was timely.\n                             I\n  The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves\ntors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co.\nand others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know\ningly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning the use of Merck’s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to\neconomic losses when the risks later became apparent).\nThe plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under\n§10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); SEC Rule 10b–5, 17\nCFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005).\n   The applicable statute of limitations provides that a\n“private right of action” that, like the present action,\n“involves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con\ntrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement\nconcerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of—\n   “(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting\nthe violation; or\n   “(2) 5 years after such violation.” 28 U. S. C. §1658(b).\n   The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,\n2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years\nof the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for\ntimeliness purposes is November 6, 2001—two years\nbefore this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before\nthis date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the\n“facts constituting the violation.” If so, by the time the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period\nin §1658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had\nnot, and could not have, discovered by the critical date\nthose “facts,” particularly not the facts related to scienter,\nand that their complaint was therefore timely.\n                            A\n  We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,\nas we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and\nthe opinions below.\n  1. 1990’s. In the mid-1990’s Merck developed Vioxx. In\n1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it\nfor prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe body’s production of an enzyme called COX–2 (cyclooxy-\ngenase-2). COX–2 is associated with pain and inflamma-\ntion. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its\nclass like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not\ninhibit production of a second enzyme called COX–1\n(cyclooxygenase-1). COX–1 plays a part in the functioning\nof the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation\n(associated with blood clots). App. 50–51.\n   2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,\ncalled the “VIGOR” study. Id., at 291–294. The study\ncompared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The\nstudy showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer\ngastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But\nthe study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every\n1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,\ncompared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took\nnaproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Com-\nparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib\nand Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343\nNew England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526–1527 (2000).\n   Merck’s press release acknowledged VIGOR’s adverse\ncardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were\n“consistent with naproxen’s ability to block platelet aggre-\ngation.” App. 291. Merck noted that, since “Vioxx, like all\nCOX–2 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggre-\ngation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.”\nIbid. And Merck added that “safety data from all other\ncompleted and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indica-\ntion of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic\nevents between Vioxx” and either a placebo or comparable\ndrugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).\n   This theory—that VIGOR’s troubling cardiovascular\nfindings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred\nby naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx—\nlater became known as the “naproxen hypothesis.” In\nadvancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the\n4                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnaproxen benefit “had not been observed previously.” Id.,\nat 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all\nof the above—the positive gastrointestinal results, the\ntroubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,\nand the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.\nSee id., at 355–391, 508–557.\n   3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about\nthe naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the\nFDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider\nMerck’s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect\nVIGOR’s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR\ncardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392–\n395, 558–577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a\nproducts-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that\n“Merck’s own research” had demonstrated that “users of\nVioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as\ncompared to other less expensive, medications.” Id., at\n869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation wrote that the available data raised a “cau\ntionary flag” and strongly urged that “a trial specifically\nassessing cardiovascular risk” be done. Id., at 331–332;\nMukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular\nEvents Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286\nJAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg\nNews quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck\nhad “additional data” that were “very, very reassuring,”\nand Merck issued a press release stating that it stood\n“behind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of\nVioxx.” App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a\nwarning letter released to the public on September 21,\n2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,\nMerck’s Vioxx marketing was “false, lacking in fair bal\nance, or otherwise misleading.” Id., at 339. At the same\ntime, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas a “possible explanation” of the VIGOR results. Id., at\n340. But it found that Merck’s “promotional campaign\nselectively present[ed]” that hypothesis without adequately\nacknowledging “another reasonable explanation,” namely,\n“that Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio\nvascular] properties.” Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to\nsend healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.\n    After the FDA letter was released, more products\nliability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885–956. Merck’s\nshare price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.\nBy October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October\n9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam\nined its own data and “found no evidence that Vioxx in\ncreased the risk of heart attacks.” App. 504. It quoted the\npresident of Merck Research Laboratories as positing\n“ ‘two possible interpretations’ ”: “ ‘Naproxen lowers the\nheart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.’ ” Ibid. Stock ana\nlysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that\nthe FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis\nremained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,\nat 614, 626, 628.\n                             B\n   We next set forth three important events that occurred\nafter the critical date.\n   1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the\nresults of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos\nton’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After examining\nthe medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa\ntients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to\n90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart\nattack than those given either a different painkiller or no\npainkiller at all. Id., at 164–165. (That is to say, if pa\ntients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at\nall suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of\npatients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMerck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study’s limita\ntions. Id., at 165–167.\n   2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the\nmarket. It said that a new study had found “an increased\nrisk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18\nmonths of continuous therapy.” Id., at 182 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly\ndescribed the results as “totally unexpected.” Id., at 186.\nMerck’s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.\n   3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published\nan article stating that “internal Merck e-mails and mar\nketing materials as well as interviews with outside scien\ntists show that the company fought forcefully for years to\nkeep safety concerns from destroying the drug’s commer\ncial prospects.” Id., at 189–190. The article said that an\nearly e-mail from Merck’s head of research had said that\nthe VIGOR “results showed that the cardiovascular events\n‘are clearly there,’ ” that it was “ ‘a shame but . . . a low\nincidence,’ ” and that it “ ‘is mechanism based as we wor\nried it was.’ ” Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had\ngiven its salespeople instructions to “ ‘DODGE’ ” questions\nabout Vioxx’s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,\n2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged\nthat Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the\nnaproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.\nIt said, for example, that Merck “knew, at least as early as\n1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,” and that a\n“1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .\nserious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more\nfrequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a\ndifferent arthritis drug or placebo.” Id., at 56, 58–59\n(emphasis and capitalization deleted).\n   Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown the “facts constituting the violation” at least two\nyears earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it\nwas filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.\nThe court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the\n(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck’s (Octo\nber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a\n“possibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented\nmaterial facts” no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing\nthe plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” to look further.

Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litigation,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334341\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334341/in-re-merck-co-inc-securities-derivative/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to “show that they\nexercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were\nunable to discover their injuries,” the court took October 9,\n2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run\nand therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A\nmajority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while\nconstituting “storm warnings,” did not suggest much by\nway of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs\non “inquiry notice,” requiring them to investigate further.\nIn re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litiga\ntion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid\nered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the\n2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).\n   Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis\nagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo\nharous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita\ntions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs\non “inquiry notice” of the need for investigation), with\nShah v.

The parties and the Solicitor General\nagree that §1658(b)(1)’s word “discovery” refers not only to\na plaintiff’s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to\nthe facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered. We agree. But because the statute’s language\ndoes not make this interpretation obvious, and because we\ncannot answer the question presented without considering\nwhether the parties are right about this matter, we set\nforth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.\n\n   We recognize that one might read the statutory words\n“after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation”\nas referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the\nrelevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,\nthe word “discovery” is often used as a term of art in con\nnection with the “discovery rule,” a doctrine that delays\naccrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has “discov\nered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to\nthe general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues\nonce a plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of ac\ntion,” Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust\nFund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)\n(citing Clark v.

Accordingly, “where a plaintiff has been\ninjured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without\nany fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar\nof the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered.” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And for more than a century, courts have under\nstood that “[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been\ndiscovered.” 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions §276b(11),\np. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401–1403, and nn. 74–\n84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,\nsupra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\nR. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule “regard[s] the\ncause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud\nwas or should have been discovered”).\n  More recently, both state and federal courts have ap\nplied forms of the “discovery rule” to claims other than\nfraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions §§11.1.2.1,\n11.1.2.3, pp. 136–142, and nn. 6–13, 18–23 (1991 and 1993\nSupp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla\ntures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.\n2 Corman §11.2, at 170–171, and nn. 1–9 (collecting stat\nutes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2409a(g) (actions to quiet title\nagainst the United States). In doing so, legislators have\nwritten the word “discovery” directly into the statute. And\nwhen they have done so, state and federal courts have\ntypically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual\ndiscovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea\ncock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217–220, 55 S. E. 99, 100\n(1906); Davis v.

Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit §347, p. 354 (2001 and\nSupp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of “dis\ncovery” all provide that “in addition to actual knowledge of\nthe fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position\nthat they should have sufficient knowledge or information\nto have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged\nwith discovery”); id., at 354–355, and nn. 2–11 (collecting\ncases).\n   Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended\ncourts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1)\nsimilarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this\nCourt, having found in the federal securities laws the\nexistence of an implied private §10(b) action, determined\nits governing limitations period by looking to other limita\ntions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,\nLipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350\n(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations\n“differ[ing] slightly in terminology,” the Court chose the\nlanguage in 15 U. S. C. §78i(e), the statutory provision\nthat governs securities price manipulation claims. 501\nU. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that\nprivate §10(b) actions “must be commenced within one\nyear after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola\ntion and within three years after such violation.” Id., at\n364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nous formulations the one in 15 U. S. C. §77m, on which the\nconcurrence relies. See post, at 2–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,\nand n. 7 (quoting §77m).)\n  Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the\nmatter held that “discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation” occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov\ners the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,\nLaw v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785–786 (CA7\n1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,\n353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,\n306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).\nSome of those courts noted that other limitations provi\nsions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that\nthe period begins to run “ ‘after the discovery of the untrue\nstatement . . . or after such discovery should have been\nmade by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,’ ” whereas\nthe formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15\nU. S. C. §78i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting\n§77m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at\n364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term “discov\nery” in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long\nbeen understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili\ngent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit\nprovision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at\n721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499–\n500.\n  In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations\nstatute, it repeated Lampf’s critical language. The statute\nsays that an action based on fraud “may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of\nthe facts constituting the violation” (or “5 years after such\nviolation”). §804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. §1658(b) (emphasis added). (This\nstatutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc\n12               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,\n§77m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n§1113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an\naction be brought “three years after the earliest date on\nwhich the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or\nviolation” (emphasis added)).)      Not surprisingly, the\nCourts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter\npret the word “discovery” in this statute as including not\nonly facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts\nany reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,\nStaehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d\n406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne\nParish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).\n   We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–117,\nand n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus\ntries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history\nand precedent surrounding the use of the word “discovery”\nin the limitations context generally as well as in this\nprovision in particular, the reasons for making this as\nsumption are particularly strong here. We consequently\nhold that “discovery” as used in this statute encompasses\nnot only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also\nthose facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown. And we evaluate Merck’s claims accordingly.\n                             III\n   We turn now to Merck’s arguments in favor of holding\nthat petitioners’ claims accrued before November 6, 2001.\nFirst, Merck argues that the statute does not require\n“discovery” of scienter-related “facts.” See Brief for Peti\ntioners 19–28. We cannot agree, however, that facts about\nscienter are unnecessary.\n   The statute says that the limitations period does not\nbegin to run until “discovery of the facts constituting the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation.”    28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nScienter is assuredly a “fact.” In a §10(b) action, scienter\nrefers to “a mental state embracing intent to deceive,\nmanipulate, or defraud.” Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,\nn. 12. And the “ ‘state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as\nthe state of his digestion.’ ” Postal Service Bd. of Gover\nnors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging\nton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).\n  And this “fact” of scienter “constitut[es]” an important\nand necessary element of a §10(b) “violation.” A plaintiff\ncannot recover without proving that a defendant made a\nmaterial misstatement with an intent to deceive—not\nmerely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);\nErnst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted\nspecial heightened pleading requirements for the scienter\nelement of §10(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2)\n(requiring plaintiffs to “state with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind” (emphasis added)). As a\nresult, unless a §10(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the\ncomplaint showing that it is more likely than not that the\ndefendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the\nclaim will fail. See Tellabs, supra, at 328. It would there\nfore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule in this\nprovision—which, after all, specifically applies only in\ncases “involv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or\ncontrivance,” §1658(b)—if the limitations period began to\nrun regardless of whether a plaintiff had discovered any\nfacts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant con\ncealed for two years that he made a misstatement with an\nintent to deceive, the limitations period would expire\nbefore the plaintiff had actually “discover[ed]” the fraud.\n  We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are\namong those that “constitut[e] the violation.” In so hold\ning, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support\n14               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na private §10(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a\nplaintiff’s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among\nthose that constitute “the violation” and therefore need not\nbe “discover[ed]” for a claim to accrue).\n   Second, Merck argues that, even if “discovery” requires\nfacts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi\nally false or misleading statement (or material omission)\nare ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See\nBrief for Petitioners 22, 28–29. But we do not see how\nthat is so. We recognize that certain statements are such\nthat, to show them false is normally to show scienter as\nwell. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would\nfalsely say “I am not married” without being aware of the\nfact that his statement is false. Where §10(b) is at issue,\nhowever, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is\nmore context specific. An incorrect prediction about a\nfirm’s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell\nus whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an\ninnocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the\nstatute may require “discovery” of scienter-related facts\nbeyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be\nmaterially false or misleading. Merck fears that this\nrequirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen\ndants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress’\ninclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions\ninstituted “5 years after such violation,” §1658(b)(2), giv\ning defendants total repose after five years, should dimin\nish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa\nrable bar not subject to equitable tolling).\n   Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to\nrun prior to November 2001 because by that point the\nplaintiffs were on “inquiry notice.” Merck uses the term\n“inquiry notice” to refer to the point “at which a plaintiff\npossesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive\nof wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.”\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of\nAppeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,\ne.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254\n(CA11 2002) (“[I]nquiry notice [is] “ ‘the term used for\nknowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\nbegin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had\nbeen infringed’ ”). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (“duty of\ninquiry” arises once “circumstances would suggest to an\ninvestor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she\nhad been defrauded”); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.\nKapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335–1336 (CA7 1997) (“The facts\nconstituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to\nincite the victim to investigate” and “to enable him to tie\nup any loose ends and complete the investigation in time\nto file a timely suit”); Great Rivers Cooperative of South\neastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,\n896 (CA8 1997) (“Inquiry notice exists when the victim is\naware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\ninvestigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of\nthe defendant’s misrepresentations” (emphasis added)).\n   If the term “inquiry notice” refers to the point where the\nfacts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi\ngate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which\nthe plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing\nscienter or other “facts constituting the violation.” But the\nstatute says that the plaintiff’s claim accrues only after the\n“discovery” of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug\ngests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before\n“discovery” can take place. Merck points out that, as we\nhave discussed, see supra, at 8–9, the court-created “discov\nery rule” exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not\ngenerally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their\nclaims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here\nwith a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.\nBecause the statute contains no indication that the limita\ntions period should occur at some earlier moment before\n16                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“discovery,” when a plaintiff would have begun investigat\ning, we cannot accept Merck’s argument.\n   As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations\nperiod does generally begin at “discovery,” it should none\ntheless run from the point of “inquiry notice” in one par\nticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to\nundertake an investigation once placed on “inquiry no\ntice.” In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual\nplaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not “effectively\nexcuse a plaintiff’s failure to conduct a further investiga\ntion” by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff “in the same position.” Brief for Petition\ners 48.\n   We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same\nreason we reject “inquiry notice” as the standard gener\nally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply\nprovides that “discovery” is the event that triggers the 2\nyear limitations period—for all plaintiffs. Cf. United\nStates v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (“Laches within\nthe term of the statute of limitations is no defense at\nlaw”). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain\ntiffs “in the same position” no matter whether they inves\ntigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations\nperiod puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on “in\nquiry notice” at a disadvantage because it lapses two years\nafter a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered\nthe necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves\ntigate or delays investigating may well not have discov\nered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have\nfound sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a §10(b)\ncomplaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead\ning standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1\n2002) (“[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may\nconsume as little as a few days or as much as a few years\nto get to the bottom of the matter”).\n   Merck further contends that its proposed “inquiry no\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntice” standard is superior, because determining when a\nhypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n“discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for\njudges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional\ndiscovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad\ncircumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already\nask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,\ne.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New\nEngland Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at\n1, 9–10; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201\n(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122\nF. 3d 363, 367–368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this\nprecedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that\nthe “discovery” of facts that put a plaintiff on “inquiry\nnotice” does not automatically begin the running of the\nlimitations period.\n\n  We conclude that the limitations period in §1658(b)(1)\nbegins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona\nbly diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed] the facts\nconstituting the violation”—whichever comes first. In\ndetermining the time at which “discovery” of those “facts”\noccurred, terms such as “inquiry notice” and “storm warn\nings” may be useful to the extent that they identify a time\nwhen the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent\nplaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period\ndoes not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov\ners or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov\nered “the facts constituting the violation,” including sci\nenter—irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff\nundertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n                            IV\n  Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal\narguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem\n18               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have\ndiscovered “the facts constituting the violation.” In re\nspect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA’s\nSeptember 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck\nhad “ ‘minimized’ ” the VIGOR study’s “ ‘potentially serious\ncardiovascular findings’ ” and (2) pleadings filed in prod\nucts-liability actions in September and October 2001\nalleging that Merck had “ ‘omitted, suppressed, or con\ncealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks\nassociated with Vioxx’ ” and “purposefully downplayed\nand/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ\nated with Vioxx.” Brief for Petitioners 36–37 (quoting\nApp. 340, 893).\n   The FDA’s warning letter, however, shows little or\nnothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether\nMerck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent\nintent. See Part I–A(4), supra. The FDA itself described\nthe pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a “possible explana\ntion” for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing\nsufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to\nMerck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.\n   The products-liability complaints’ statements about\nMerck’s knowledge show little more. See Part I–A(3),\nsupra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con\ntained any specific information suggesting the fraud al\nleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis\nwas false even as it promoted it. And, without providing\nany reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access\nto information about Merck’s state of mind, the complaints\nalleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed\ninformation about Vioxx and “purposefully downplayed\nand/or understated” the risks associated with Vioxx—the\nsame charge made in the FDA warning letter.

Regardless of\nwhich, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,\nconstituted “discovery,” we need only conclude that prior\nto November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff\nwould have discovered, “the facts constituting the viola\ntion.” In light of our interpretation of the statute, our\nholdings in respect to scienter, and our application of\nthose holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,\nand we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs’ suit\nis timely. We need not—and do not—pass upon the Court\nof Appeals’ suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham\nand Women’s study might have triggered the statute of\nlimitations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n                                                  Affirmed.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

In this case there is no difference between the time\nwhen the plaintiffs actually discovered the factual basis\nfor their claim and the time when reasonably diligent\nplaintiffs should have discovered those facts.

S. C. §78j(b), must be brought within\n“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation” or “(2) 5 years after such violation,” whichever\ncomes first. 28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1). I agree with the\nCourt that scienter is among the “facts constituting the\nviolation” that a plaintiff must “discove[r]” for the limita\ntions period to begin. Ante, at 12–14 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I also agree that respondents’ suit is\ntimely, but for a reason different from the Court’s: Merck\nhas not shown that respondents actually “discover[ed]”\nscienter more than two years before bringing suit.\n   In ordinary usage, “discovery” occurs when one actually\nlearns something new. See Webster’s New International\nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)\n(defining “discovery” as “[f]inding out or ascertaining\nsomething previously unknown or unrecognized”). As the\nCourt notes, however, ante, at 8–10, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations “discovery” has long carried an\nadditional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer\ncising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\nfacts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,\n101 U. S. 135, 140–142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nActions §276b(11)–(13), pp. 1401–1408 (4th ed. 1916);\nDawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation,\n31 Mich. L. Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola\ntion, “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) might mean constructive\ndiscovery.\n   In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13\nof the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab\nlished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under §§11\nand 12 of that Act:\n    “No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability\n    created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title\n    unless brought within one year after the discovery of\n    the untrue statement or the omission, or after such\n    discovery should have been made by the exercise of\n    reasonable diligence . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §77m.\n“[D]iscovery” in §77m obviously cannot mean constructive\ndiscovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase\n“or after such discovery should have been made by the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. With §77m al\nready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in\nthe 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. §§78i(e), 78r(c), that did not\ncontain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab\nlished a time bar that runs from “discovery” simpliciter.\nWhen Congress enacted §1658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing\na limitations period for private actions for “fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws,” specifi\ncally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.\n§78c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery\ncaveat. To interpret §1658(b)(1) as imposing a construc\ntive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con\ntrary to common sense, that the same word means two\nvery different things in the same statutory context of\nlimitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the\n1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   True, the sensible presumption that a word means the\nsame thing when it appears more than once in the same\nstatutory context—or even in the very same statute—is\nrebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–596 (2004). Context may make\nclear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,\nand in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596–\n597. But nothing in the context of §77m or §1658(b)(1)\nsuggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita\ntions periods for federal-law claims based on various false\nstatements or omissions involving securities. The former\napplies to false statements or omissions in registration\nstatements, §77k, and offers to sell securities, §77l(a)(2);\nthe broad language of the latter (“claim[s] of fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws”) covers\nother “manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv\nance[s]” made “in connection with the purchase or sale” of\na security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com\nmission regulations, §78j(b), including SEC Rule 10b–5, 17\nCFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009). There is good reason, more\nover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private\n§10(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive\ndiscovery rule for claims governed by §77m: The elements\nof §10(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more\ndifficult to discover than the elements of claims under\n§77k or §77l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean\nv. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208–209 (1976); In re Morgan\nStanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d\n347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan\ndard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by §77m.\nDetermining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an\nuntrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus\nis much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should\nhave learned that the defendant deliberately misled him\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusing a deceptive device covered by §10(b).1\n   Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that\nwarrants giving “discovery” two meanings, the Court\nrelies on the historical treatment of “discovery” in limita\ntions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat\ning a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8–10, 12. But\nthat history proves only that “discovery” can carry that\ntechnical meaning, and that without §77m it would be\nreasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.\nIt does not show what “discovery” means in §1658(b)(1) in\nlight of §77m’s codification of a constructive-discovery\nrule. In my view, the meaning of “discovery” in the\nbroader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its\nmeaning in the more specific context of the federal securi\nties laws.\n   The Court’s other reason for rejecting the more natural\nreading of §1658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the\nCourts of Appeals before the provision’s enactment. Ante,\nat 11–12. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.\nGilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we\nexplicitly adopted the terms of §78i(e)—which like\n§1658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of\nreasonable diligence—as the limitations period for the\nprivate §10(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and\n——————\n  1 The Court appears to believe that §77m’s distinction between actual\n\nand constructive discovery has no bearing on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning\nbecause the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at\n11–12. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word\n(“discovery”) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;\nand its use in §77m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.\n  The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes\nare irrelevant, ante, at 11–12, but of course it does not believe that. Its\nentire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to “discov\nery” in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state\nlegislatures), ante, at 8–10. Yet while the Court considers that broader\ncontext, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific\ncontext of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Ante, at 11–12.\n  Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate\nthe Circuits’ views—which requires the further unrealistic\nassumption that a majority of each House knew of and\nagreed with the Courts of Appeals’ opinions—that would\nbe entirely irrelevant. Congress’s collective intent (if such\na thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in\nany event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent\napart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).\n  The only way in which the Circuits’ pre-2002 decisions\nmight bear on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning is if all (or nearly all)\nof the Circuits had interpreted “discovery” in §78i(e) to\nmean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could\nsay that those decisions had established the public mean\ning of the term in this context—whether Congress knew of\n(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v.

To the con\ntrary, the fact that in enacting §1658(b)(1) Congress did not copy\n§77m’s constructive-discovery proviso—but decreed instead that “dis\ncovery” alone starts the clock (as it had done in §78i(e), which we\nborrowed in Lampf)—is what makes equating §77m and §1658(b)(1) so\nimplausible.\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).\n   But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty\nat Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23–29 (here\ninafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the\nCourt and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting\nthe language Lampf adopted from §78i(e) as imposing\nsome form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.\nFong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.\nBrown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard\nv.

S. 978 (1992).\nOthers, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not\ninterpreting §78i(e) at all, but looked directly to §77m,\ndespite Lampf’s explicit selection of §78i(e)’s terms. Great\nRivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland\nIndustries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); Topalian\nv. Ehrman, 954 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992). Another\ncourt candidly acknowledged that §78i(e)’s text—unlike\n§77m’s—forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe\nless held that courts remain “free to apply to [§78i(e)] the\njudge-made doctrine of inquiry notice” as a “modest and\ntraditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,” since “Con\ngress could not have known when it enacted [§78i(e)] that\nthis section would someday provide the statute of limita\ntions for a wide range of securities frauds.” Tregenza v.\nGreat American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–\n722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).\n   The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the\nissue before §1658(b)(1)’s enactment.

And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt\non a constructive-discovery view in dicta—of which the\nomniscient Congress of the Court’s imagining should also\nhave been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,\n175 F. 3d 699, 703–705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water\nhouse, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).\n   This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere\nnear establishing that the word “discovery” in §78i(e)\nmeant constructive rather than actual discovery despite\n§77m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read\n“discovery” differently in §1658(b)(1) and §77m, I would\nhold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita\ntions period for §10(b) claims. Since Merck points to no\nevidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter\nmore than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with\nthe Court that the suit was not time barred.\n   Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33–34,\nthat in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any\ndifference between actual and constructive discovery\nbecause of the presumption of reliance applicable in such\ncases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).\nIt seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis\ncussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price\nsignals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public\ninformation, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa\ntion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde\npendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a\nconstructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield\nthe same result, actual discovery is what §1658(b)(1)\nrequires to start the limitations period.\n</pre>", "id": 78784, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/04/27/Merck__Co._v._Reynolds.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 30, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac\n tion under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging\n that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart\n attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com\n plaint is timely if filed no more than “2 years after the discovery of\n the facts constituting the violation” or 5 years after the violation. 28\n U. S. C. §1658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un\n timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil\n ity of Merck’s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than\n 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under\n take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the\n relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 “VIGOR” study com\n paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car\n diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to\n the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm\n caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let\n ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck’s\n Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was “false,\n lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading”; and (3) pleadings\n filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al\n leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten\n tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding\n that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted\n with scienter, an element of a §10(b) violation, and consequently did\n not commence the running of the limitations period.\nHeld:\n    1. The limitations period in §1658(b)(1) begins to run once the\n plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n2                      MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    have “discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation”—whichever\n    comes first. In the statute of limitations context, “discovery” is often\n    used as a term of art in connection with the “discovery rule,” a doc\n    trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has\n    “discovered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by\n    state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures\n    have sometimes codified this rule. When “discovery” is written di\n    rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re\n    fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery\n    of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in\n    tended courts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) simi\n    larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov\n    erning limitations period for private §10(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,\n    Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding\n    that such actions “must be commenced within one year after the dis\n    covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,” id., at 364 (empha\n    sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have\n    held that “discovery” occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers\n    the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n    have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf’s critical\n    language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,\n    when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece\n    dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–\n    117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use\n    of “discovery” in the limitations context generally as well as in this\n    provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly\n    strong here. Merck’s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8–12.\n       2. In determining the time at which “discovery” occurs, terms such\n    as “inquiry notice” and “storm warnings” may be useful insofar as\n    they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona\n    bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe\n    riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a\n    reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered “the facts consti\n    tuting the violation,” including scienter—irrespective of whether the\n    actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n    Pp. 12–17.\n          (a) Contrary to Merck’s argument, facts showing scienter are\n    among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” Scienter is assuredly a\n    “fact.” In a §10(b) action, it refers to “a mental state embracing in\n    tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n    425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and “constitut[es]” an important and neces\n    sary element of a §10(b) “violation.” See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues\n    & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. Because the scienter element of\n    §10(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2), unless a §10(b) complaint sets out facts\nshowing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with\nthe relevant intent, the claim will fail. It would frustrate the very\npurpose of the discovery rule codified in §1658(b)(1) if the limitations\nperiod began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had “dis\ncover[ed]” any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12–14.\n     (b) The Court also rejects Merck’s argument that, even if “discov\nery” requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate\nrially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi\nnarily sufficient to show scienter. Where §10(b) is at issue, the\nrelation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.\nFor instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm’s future earnings,\nby itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber\nately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, “discovery” of additional\nscienter-related facts may be required. The statute’s inclusion of an\nunqualified bar on actions instituted “5 years after such violation,”\n§1658(b)(2), should diminish Merck’s fear that this requirement will\ngive life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts\ntaken long ago. P. 14.\n     (c) And the Court cannot accept Merck’s argument that the limi\ntations period begins at “inquiry notice,” meaning the point where\nthe facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur\nther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the\nplaintiff would already have “discover[ed]” facts showing scienter or\nother “facts constituting the violation.” The statute says that the\nplaintiff’s claim accrues only after the “discovery” of those latter\nfacts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some\ntimes begin before “discovery” can take place. Merck also argues that\ndetermining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave “discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for judges\nto undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have\nlong had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this\nkind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14–17.\n  3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered, “the facts constituting the violation.” The FDA’s Septem\nber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here\nrelevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy\npothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy\npothesis as a “possible explanation” for the VIGOR results, faulting\nMerck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al\nternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com\nplaints’ general statements about Merck’s state of mind show little\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    more. Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-\n    November 2001 circumstances reveal “facts” indicating the relevant\n    scienter.

The complaint was\ntimely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs\n“discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.” 28\nU. S. C. §1658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute\nfor the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)\nwhen the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea\nsonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts\nconstituting the violation”—whichever comes first. We\nalso hold that the “facts constituting the violation” include\nthe fact of scienter, “a mental state embracing intent to\ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this\nstandard, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination\nthat the complaint filed here was timely.\n                             I\n  The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves\ntors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co.\nand others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know\ningly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning the use of Merck’s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to\neconomic losses when the risks later became apparent).\nThe plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under\n§10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); SEC Rule 10b–5, 17\nCFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005).\n   The applicable statute of limitations provides that a\n“private right of action” that, like the present action,\n“involves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con\ntrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement\nconcerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of—\n   “(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting\nthe violation; or\n   “(2) 5 years after such violation.” 28 U. S. C. §1658(b).\n   The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,\n2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years\nof the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for\ntimeliness purposes is November 6, 2001—two years\nbefore this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before\nthis date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the\n“facts constituting the violation.” If so, by the time the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period\nin §1658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had\nnot, and could not have, discovered by the critical date\nthose “facts,” particularly not the facts related to scienter,\nand that their complaint was therefore timely.\n                            A\n  We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,\nas we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and\nthe opinions below.\n  1. 1990’s. In the mid-1990’s Merck developed Vioxx. In\n1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it\nfor prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe body’s production of an enzyme called COX–2 (cyclooxy-\ngenase-2). COX–2 is associated with pain and inflamma-\ntion. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its\nclass like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not\ninhibit production of a second enzyme called COX–1\n(cyclooxygenase-1). COX–1 plays a part in the functioning\nof the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation\n(associated with blood clots). App. 50–51.\n   2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,\ncalled the “VIGOR” study. Id., at 291–294. The study\ncompared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The\nstudy showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer\ngastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But\nthe study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every\n1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,\ncompared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took\nnaproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Com-\nparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib\nand Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343\nNew England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526–1527 (2000).\n   Merck’s press release acknowledged VIGOR’s adverse\ncardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were\n“consistent with naproxen’s ability to block platelet aggre-\ngation.” App. 291. Merck noted that, since “Vioxx, like all\nCOX–2 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggre-\ngation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.”\nIbid. And Merck added that “safety data from all other\ncompleted and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indica-\ntion of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic\nevents between Vioxx” and either a placebo or comparable\ndrugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).\n   This theory—that VIGOR’s troubling cardiovascular\nfindings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred\nby naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx—\nlater became known as the “naproxen hypothesis.” In\nadvancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the\n4                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnaproxen benefit “had not been observed previously.” Id.,\nat 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all\nof the above—the positive gastrointestinal results, the\ntroubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,\nand the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.\nSee id., at 355–391, 508–557.\n   3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about\nthe naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the\nFDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider\nMerck’s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect\nVIGOR’s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR\ncardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392–\n395, 558–577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a\nproducts-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that\n“Merck’s own research” had demonstrated that “users of\nVioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as\ncompared to other less expensive, medications.” Id., at\n869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation wrote that the available data raised a “cau\ntionary flag” and strongly urged that “a trial specifically\nassessing cardiovascular risk” be done. Id., at 331–332;\nMukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular\nEvents Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286\nJAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg\nNews quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck\nhad “additional data” that were “very, very reassuring,”\nand Merck issued a press release stating that it stood\n“behind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of\nVioxx.” App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a\nwarning letter released to the public on September 21,\n2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,\nMerck’s Vioxx marketing was “false, lacking in fair bal\nance, or otherwise misleading.” Id., at 339. At the same\ntime, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas a “possible explanation” of the VIGOR results. Id., at\n340. But it found that Merck’s “promotional campaign\nselectively present[ed]” that hypothesis without adequately\nacknowledging “another reasonable explanation,” namely,\n“that Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio\nvascular] properties.” Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to\nsend healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.\n    After the FDA letter was released, more products\nliability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885–956. Merck’s\nshare price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.\nBy October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October\n9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam\nined its own data and “found no evidence that Vioxx in\ncreased the risk of heart attacks.” App. 504. It quoted the\npresident of Merck Research Laboratories as positing\n“ ‘two possible interpretations’ ”: “ ‘Naproxen lowers the\nheart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.’ ” Ibid. Stock ana\nlysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that\nthe FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis\nremained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,\nat 614, 626, 628.\n                             B\n   We next set forth three important events that occurred\nafter the critical date.\n   1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the\nresults of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos\nton’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After examining\nthe medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa\ntients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to\n90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart\nattack than those given either a different painkiller or no\npainkiller at all. Id., at 164–165. (That is to say, if pa\ntients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at\nall suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of\npatients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMerck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study’s limita\ntions. Id., at 165–167.\n   2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the\nmarket. It said that a new study had found “an increased\nrisk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18\nmonths of continuous therapy.” Id., at 182 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly\ndescribed the results as “totally unexpected.” Id., at 186.\nMerck’s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.\n   3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published\nan article stating that “internal Merck e-mails and mar\nketing materials as well as interviews with outside scien\ntists show that the company fought forcefully for years to\nkeep safety concerns from destroying the drug’s commer\ncial prospects.” Id., at 189–190. The article said that an\nearly e-mail from Merck’s head of research had said that\nthe VIGOR “results showed that the cardiovascular events\n‘are clearly there,’ ” that it was “ ‘a shame but . . . a low\nincidence,’ ” and that it “ ‘is mechanism based as we wor\nried it was.’ ” Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had\ngiven its salespeople instructions to “ ‘DODGE’ ” questions\nabout Vioxx’s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,\n2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged\nthat Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the\nnaproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.\nIt said, for example, that Merck “knew, at least as early as\n1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,” and that a\n“1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .\nserious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more\nfrequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a\ndifferent arthritis drug or placebo.” Id., at 56, 58–59\n(emphasis and capitalization deleted).\n   Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown the “facts constituting the violation” at least two\nyears earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it\nwas filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.\nThe court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the\n(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck’s (Octo\nber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a\n“possibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented\nmaterial facts” no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing\nthe plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” to look further. In re\nMerck & Co. Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litigation,\n483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to “show that they\nexercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were\nunable to discover their injuries,” the court took October 9,\n2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run\nand therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A\nmajority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while\nconstituting “storm warnings,” did not suggest much by\nway of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs\non “inquiry notice,” requiring them to investigate further.\nIn re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & “ERISA” Litiga\ntion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid\nered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the\n2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).\n   Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis\nagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo\nharous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita\ntions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs\non “inquiry notice” of the need for investigation), with\nShah v. Meeker, 435 F. 3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but\nif plaintiff does investigate, period runs “from the date\nsuch inquiry should have revealed the fraud” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care\nEmployees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d\n495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period always begins to\n8                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrun only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being\nput on “inquiry notice,” should have discovered facts con\nstituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe granted Merck’s petition.\n                             II\n  Before turning to Merck’s arguments, we consider a\nmore basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General\nagree that §1658(b)(1)’s word “discovery” refers not only to\na plaintiff’s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to\nthe facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered. We agree. But because the statute’s language\ndoes not make this interpretation obvious, and because we\ncannot answer the question presented without considering\nwhether the parties are right about this matter, we set\nforth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.\n\n   We recognize that one might read the statutory words\n“after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation”\nas referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the\nrelevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,\nthe word “discovery” is often used as a term of art in con\nnection with the “discovery rule,” a doctrine that delays\naccrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has “discov\nered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to\nthe general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues\nonce a plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of ac\ntion,” Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust\nFund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)\n(citing Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875); inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). This Court long ago recog\nnized that something different was needed in the case of\nfraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent\na plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been\ndefrauded. Otherwise, “the law which was designed to\nprevent fraud” could become “the means by which it is\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmade successful and secure.” Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall.\n342, 349 (1875). Accordingly, “where a plaintiff has been\ninjured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without\nany fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar\nof the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered.” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And for more than a century, courts have under\nstood that “[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been\ndiscovered.” 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions §276b(11),\np. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401–1403, and nn. 74–\n84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,\nsupra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\nR. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule “regard[s] the\ncause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud\nwas or should have been discovered”).\n  More recently, both state and federal courts have ap\nplied forms of the “discovery rule” to claims other than\nfraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions §§11.1.2.1,\n11.1.2.3, pp. 136–142, and nn. 6–13, 18–23 (1991 and 1993\nSupp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla\ntures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.\n2 Corman §11.2, at 170–171, and nn. 1–9 (collecting stat\nutes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2409a(g) (actions to quiet title\nagainst the United States). In doing so, legislators have\nwritten the word “discovery” directly into the statute. And\nwhen they have done so, state and federal courts have\ntypically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual\ndiscovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea\ncock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217–220, 55 S. E. 99, 100\n(1906); Davis v. Hibernia Sav. & Loan Soc., 21 Cal. App.\n444, 448, 132 P. 462, 464 (1913); Roether v. National\nUnion Fire Ins. Co., 51 N. D. 634, 640–642, 200 N. W. 818,\n10               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n821 (1924); Goldenberg v. Bache & Co., 270 F. 2d 675, 681\n(CA5 1959); Mobley v. Hall, 202 Mont. 227, 232, 657 P. 2d\n604, 606 (1983); Tregenza v. Great American Communica\ntions Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–722 (CA7 1993); J. Geils Band\nEmployee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76\nF. 3d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).\n   Thus, treatise writers now describe “the discovery rule”\nas allowing a claim “to accrue when the litigant first\nknows or with due diligence should know facts that will\nform the basis for an action.” 2 Corman §11.1.1, at 134\n(emphasis added); see also ibid., n. 1 (collecting cases); 37\nAm. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit §347, p. 354 (2001 and\nSupp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of “dis\ncovery” all provide that “in addition to actual knowledge of\nthe fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position\nthat they should have sufficient knowledge or information\nto have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged\nwith discovery”); id., at 354–355, and nn. 2–11 (collecting\ncases).\n   Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended\ncourts to interpret the word “discovery” in §1658(b)(1)\nsimilarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this\nCourt, having found in the federal securities laws the\nexistence of an implied private §10(b) action, determined\nits governing limitations period by looking to other limita\ntions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,\nLipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350\n(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations\n“differ[ing] slightly in terminology,” the Court chose the\nlanguage in 15 U. S. C. §78i(e), the statutory provision\nthat governs securities price manipulation claims. 501\nU. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that\nprivate §10(b) actions “must be commenced within one\nyear after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola\ntion and within three years after such violation.” Id., at\n364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nous formulations the one in 15 U. S. C. §77m, on which the\nconcurrence relies. See post, at 2–4 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,\nand n. 7 (quoting §77m).)\n  Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the\nmatter held that “discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation” occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov\ners the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,\nLaw v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785–786 (CA7\n1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,\n353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,\n306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).\nSome of those courts noted that other limitations provi\nsions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that\nthe period begins to run “ ‘after the discovery of the untrue\nstatement . . . or after such discovery should have been\nmade by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,’ ” whereas\nthe formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15\nU. S. C. §78i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting\n§77m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at\n364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term “discov\nery” in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long\nbeen understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili\ngent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit\nprovision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at\n721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499–\n500.\n  In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations\nstatute, it repeated Lampf’s critical language. The statute\nsays that an action based on fraud “may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of\nthe facts constituting the violation” (or “5 years after such\nviolation”). §804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. §1658(b) (emphasis added). (This\nstatutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc\n12               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,\n§77m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n§1113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an\naction be brought “three years after the earliest date on\nwhich the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or\nviolation” (emphasis added)).)      Not surprisingly, the\nCourts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter\npret the word “discovery” in this statute as including not\nonly facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts\nany reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,\nStaehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d\n406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne\nParish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).\n   We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116–117,\nand n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus\ntries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history\nand precedent surrounding the use of the word “discovery”\nin the limitations context generally as well as in this\nprovision in particular, the reasons for making this as\nsumption are particularly strong here. We consequently\nhold that “discovery” as used in this statute encompasses\nnot only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also\nthose facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown. And we evaluate Merck’s claims accordingly.\n                             III\n   We turn now to Merck’s arguments in favor of holding\nthat petitioners’ claims accrued before November 6, 2001.\nFirst, Merck argues that the statute does not require\n“discovery” of scienter-related “facts.” See Brief for Peti\ntioners 19–28. We cannot agree, however, that facts about\nscienter are unnecessary.\n   The statute says that the limitations period does not\nbegin to run until “discovery of the facts constituting the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation.”    28 U. S. C. §1658(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nScienter is assuredly a “fact.” In a §10(b) action, scienter\nrefers to “a mental state embracing intent to deceive,\nmanipulate, or defraud.” Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,\nn. 12. And the “ ‘state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as\nthe state of his digestion.’ ” Postal Service Bd. of Gover\nnors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging\nton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).\n  And this “fact” of scienter “constitut[es]” an important\nand necessary element of a §10(b) “violation.” A plaintiff\ncannot recover without proving that a defendant made a\nmaterial misstatement with an intent to deceive—not\nmerely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);\nErnst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted\nspecial heightened pleading requirements for the scienter\nelement of §10(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. §78u–4(b)(2)\n(requiring plaintiffs to “state with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind” (emphasis added)). As a\nresult, unless a §10(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the\ncomplaint showing that it is more likely than not that the\ndefendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the\nclaim will fail. See Tellabs, supra, at 328. It would there\nfore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule in this\nprovision—which, after all, specifically applies only in\ncases “involv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or\ncontrivance,” §1658(b)—if the limitations period began to\nrun regardless of whether a plaintiff had discovered any\nfacts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant con\ncealed for two years that he made a misstatement with an\nintent to deceive, the limitations period would expire\nbefore the plaintiff had actually “discover[ed]” the fraud.\n  We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are\namong those that “constitut[e] the violation.” In so hold\ning, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support\n14               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na private §10(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a\nplaintiff’s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among\nthose that constitute “the violation” and therefore need not\nbe “discover[ed]” for a claim to accrue).\n   Second, Merck argues that, even if “discovery” requires\nfacts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi\nally false or misleading statement (or material omission)\nare ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See\nBrief for Petitioners 22, 28–29. But we do not see how\nthat is so. We recognize that certain statements are such\nthat, to show them false is normally to show scienter as\nwell. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would\nfalsely say “I am not married” without being aware of the\nfact that his statement is false. Where §10(b) is at issue,\nhowever, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is\nmore context specific. An incorrect prediction about a\nfirm’s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell\nus whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an\ninnocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the\nstatute may require “discovery” of scienter-related facts\nbeyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be\nmaterially false or misleading. Merck fears that this\nrequirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen\ndants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress’\ninclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions\ninstituted “5 years after such violation,” §1658(b)(2), giv\ning defendants total repose after five years, should dimin\nish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa\nrable bar not subject to equitable tolling).\n   Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to\nrun prior to November 2001 because by that point the\nplaintiffs were on “inquiry notice.” Merck uses the term\n“inquiry notice” to refer to the point “at which a plaintiff\npossesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive\nof wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.”\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of\nAppeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,\ne.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254\n(CA11 2002) (“[I]nquiry notice [is] “ ‘the term used for\nknowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\nbegin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had\nbeen infringed’ ”). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (“duty of\ninquiry” arises once “circumstances would suggest to an\ninvestor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she\nhad been defrauded”); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.\nKapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335–1336 (CA7 1997) (“The facts\nconstituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to\nincite the victim to investigate” and “to enable him to tie\nup any loose ends and complete the investigation in time\nto file a timely suit”); Great Rivers Cooperative of South\neastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,\n896 (CA8 1997) (“Inquiry notice exists when the victim is\naware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\ninvestigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of\nthe defendant’s misrepresentations” (emphasis added)).\n   If the term “inquiry notice” refers to the point where the\nfacts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi\ngate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which\nthe plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing\nscienter or other “facts constituting the violation.” But the\nstatute says that the plaintiff’s claim accrues only after the\n“discovery” of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug\ngests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before\n“discovery” can take place. Merck points out that, as we\nhave discussed, see supra, at 8–9, the court-created “discov\nery rule” exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not\ngenerally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their\nclaims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here\nwith a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.\nBecause the statute contains no indication that the limita\ntions period should occur at some earlier moment before\n16                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“discovery,” when a plaintiff would have begun investigat\ning, we cannot accept Merck’s argument.\n   As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations\nperiod does generally begin at “discovery,” it should none\ntheless run from the point of “inquiry notice” in one par\nticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to\nundertake an investigation once placed on “inquiry no\ntice.” In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual\nplaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not “effectively\nexcuse a plaintiff’s failure to conduct a further investiga\ntion” by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff “in the same position.” Brief for Petition\ners 48.\n   We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same\nreason we reject “inquiry notice” as the standard gener\nally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply\nprovides that “discovery” is the event that triggers the 2\nyear limitations period—for all plaintiffs. Cf. United\nStates v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (“Laches within\nthe term of the statute of limitations is no defense at\nlaw”). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain\ntiffs “in the same position” no matter whether they inves\ntigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations\nperiod puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on “in\nquiry notice” at a disadvantage because it lapses two years\nafter a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered\nthe necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves\ntigate or delays investigating may well not have discov\nered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have\nfound sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a §10(b)\ncomplaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead\ning standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1\n2002) (“[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may\nconsume as little as a few days or as much as a few years\nto get to the bottom of the matter”).\n   Merck further contends that its proposed “inquiry no\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntice” standard is superior, because determining when a\nhypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n“discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for\njudges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional\ndiscovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad\ncircumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already\nask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,\ne.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New\nEngland Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at\n1, 9–10; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201\n(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122\nF. 3d 363, 367–368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this\nprecedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that\nthe “discovery” of facts that put a plaintiff on “inquiry\nnotice” does not automatically begin the running of the\nlimitations period.\n\n  We conclude that the limitations period in §1658(b)(1)\nbegins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona\nbly diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed] the facts\nconstituting the violation”—whichever comes first. In\ndetermining the time at which “discovery” of those “facts”\noccurred, terms such as “inquiry notice” and “storm warn\nings” may be useful to the extent that they identify a time\nwhen the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent\nplaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period\ndoes not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov\ners or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov\nered “the facts constituting the violation,” including sci\nenter—irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff\nundertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n                            IV\n  Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal\narguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem\n18               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have\ndiscovered “the facts constituting the violation.” In re\nspect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA’s\nSeptember 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck\nhad “ ‘minimized’ ” the VIGOR study’s “ ‘potentially serious\ncardiovascular findings’ ” and (2) pleadings filed in prod\nucts-liability actions in September and October 2001\nalleging that Merck had “ ‘omitted, suppressed, or con\ncealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks\nassociated with Vioxx’ ” and “purposefully downplayed\nand/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ\nated with Vioxx.” Brief for Petitioners 36–37 (quoting\nApp. 340, 893).\n   The FDA’s warning letter, however, shows little or\nnothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether\nMerck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent\nintent. See Part I–A(4), supra. The FDA itself described\nthe pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a “possible explana\ntion” for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing\nsufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to\nMerck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.\n   The products-liability complaints’ statements about\nMerck’s knowledge show little more. See Part I–A(3),\nsupra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con\ntained any specific information suggesting the fraud al\nleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis\nwas false even as it promoted it. And, without providing\nany reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access\nto information about Merck’s state of mind, the complaints\nalleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed\ninformation about Vioxx and “purposefully downplayed\nand/or understated” the risks associated with Vioxx—the\nsame charge made in the FDA warning letter. App. 893.\n   In our view, neither these two circumstances nor any of\nthe other pre-November 2001 circumstances that we have\nset forth in Part I–A, supra, whether viewed separately or\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntogether, reveal “facts” indicating scienter. Regardless of\nwhich, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,\nconstituted “discovery,” we need only conclude that prior\nto November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff\nwould have discovered, “the facts constituting the viola\ntion.” In light of our interpretation of the statute, our\nholdings in respect to scienter, and our application of\nthose holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,\nand we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs’ suit\nis timely. We need not—and do not—pass upon the Court\nof Appeals’ suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham\nand Women’s study might have triggered the statute of\nlimitations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n                                                  Affirmed.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

C. §1658(b)(1). I agree with the\nCourt that scienter is among the “facts constituting the\nviolation” that a plaintiff must “discove[r]” for the limita\ntions period to begin. Ante, at 12–14 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I also agree that respondents’ suit is\ntimely, but for a reason different from the Court’s: Merck\nhas not shown that respondents actually “discover[ed]”\nscienter more than two years before bringing suit.\n   In ordinary usage, “discovery” occurs when one actually\nlearns something new. See Webster’s New International\nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)\n(defining “discovery” as “[f]inding out or ascertaining\nsomething previously unknown or unrecognized”). As the\nCourt notes, however, ante, at 8–10, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations “discovery” has long carried an\nadditional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer\ncising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\nfacts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,\n101 U. S. 135, 140–142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nActions §276b(11)–(13), pp. 1401–1408 (4th ed. 1916);\nDawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation,\n31 Mich. L. Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola\ntion, “discovery” in §1658(b)(1) might mean constructive\ndiscovery.\n   In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13\nof the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab\nlished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under §§11\nand 12 of that Act:\n    “No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability\n    created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title\n    unless brought within one year after the discovery of\n    the untrue statement or the omission, or after such\n    discovery should have been made by the exercise of\n    reasonable diligence . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §77m.\n“[D]iscovery” in §77m obviously cannot mean constructive\ndiscovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase\n“or after such discovery should have been made by the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. With §77m al\nready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in\nthe 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. §§78i(e), 78r(c), that did not\ncontain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab\nlished a time bar that runs from “discovery” simpliciter.\nWhen Congress enacted §1658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing\na limitations period for private actions for “fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws,” specifi\ncally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.\n§78c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery\ncaveat. To interpret §1658(b)(1) as imposing a construc\ntive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con\ntrary to common sense, that the same word means two\nvery different things in the same statutory context of\nlimitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the\n1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   True, the sensible presumption that a word means the\nsame thing when it appears more than once in the same\nstatutory context—or even in the very same statute—is\nrebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–596 (2004). Context may make\nclear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,\nand in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596–\n597. But nothing in the context of §77m or §1658(b)(1)\nsuggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita\ntions periods for federal-law claims based on various false\nstatements or omissions involving securities. The former\napplies to false statements or omissions in registration\nstatements, §77k, and offers to sell securities, §77l(a)(2);\nthe broad language of the latter (“claim[s] of fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws”) covers\nother “manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv\nance[s]” made “in connection with the purchase or sale” of\na security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com\nmission regulations, §78j(b), including SEC Rule 10b–5, 17\nCFR §240.10b–5(b) (2009). There is good reason, more\nover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private\n§10(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive\ndiscovery rule for claims governed by §77m: The elements\nof §10(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more\ndifficult to discover than the elements of claims under\n§77k or §77l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean\nv. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208–209 (1976); In re Morgan\nStanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d\n347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan\ndard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by §77m.\nDetermining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an\nuntrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus\nis much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should\nhave learned that the defendant deliberately misled him\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusing a deceptive device covered by §10(b).1\n   Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that\nwarrants giving “discovery” two meanings, the Court\nrelies on the historical treatment of “discovery” in limita\ntions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat\ning a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8–10, 12. But\nthat history proves only that “discovery” can carry that\ntechnical meaning, and that without §77m it would be\nreasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.\nIt does not show what “discovery” means in §1658(b)(1) in\nlight of §77m’s codification of a constructive-discovery\nrule. In my view, the meaning of “discovery” in the\nbroader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its\nmeaning in the more specific context of the federal securi\nties laws.\n   The Court’s other reason for rejecting the more natural\nreading of §1658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the\nCourts of Appeals before the provision’s enactment. Ante,\nat 11–12. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.\nGilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we\nexplicitly adopted the terms of §78i(e)—which like\n§1658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of\nreasonable diligence—as the limitations period for the\nprivate §10(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and\n——————\n  1 The Court appears to believe that §77m’s distinction between actual\n\nand constructive discovery has no bearing on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning\nbecause the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at\n11–12. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word\n(“discovery”) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;\nand its use in §77m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.\n  The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes\nare irrelevant, ante, at 11–12, but of course it does not believe that. Its\nentire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to “discov\nery” in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state\nlegislatures), ante, at 8–10. Yet while the Court considers that broader\ncontext, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific\ncontext of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nn. 9.2 Since every Circuit to address the issue between\nLampf and §1658(b)(1)’s enactment 11 years later had held\nconstructive discovery applicable to §10(b) claims—and\nsince Congress copied §78i(e)’s key text into §1658(b)(1)\nwith no indication it intended to adopt a contrary rule—the\nCourt assumes Congress meant to codify (or at least not to\ndisturb) that consensus. Ante, at 11–12.\n  Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate\nthe Circuits’ views—which requires the further unrealistic\nassumption that a majority of each House knew of and\nagreed with the Courts of Appeals’ opinions—that would\nbe entirely irrelevant. Congress’s collective intent (if such\na thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in\nany event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent\napart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).\n  The only way in which the Circuits’ pre-2002 decisions\nmight bear on §1658(b)(1)’s meaning is if all (or nearly all)\nof the Circuits had interpreted “discovery” in §78i(e) to\nmean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could\nsay that those decisions had established the public mean\ning of the term in this context—whether Congress knew of\n(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v. Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\nn. 1 (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\n\n——————\n  2 The Court notes that Lampf chose §78i(e)’s limitations period as the\n\ntime bar for §10(b) claims, even though it was aware of §77m, 501 U. S.,\nat 360, and n. 7, 364, and n. 9; see ante, at 10–11. But I fail to see how\nthat provides any support for the Court’s interpretation. To the con\ntrary, the fact that in enacting §1658(b)(1) Congress did not copy\n§77m’s constructive-discovery proviso—but decreed instead that “dis\ncovery” alone starts the clock (as it had done in §78i(e), which we\nborrowed in Lampf)—is what makes equating §77m and §1658(b)(1) so\nimplausible.\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).\n   But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty\nat Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23–29 (here\ninafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the\nCourt and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting\nthe language Lampf adopted from §78i(e) as imposing\nsome form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.\nFong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.\nBrown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard\nv. Haddad, 962 F. 2d 328, 329–330 (CA4 1992); Anixter v.\nHome-Stake Production Co., 947 F. 2d 897, 898–899 (CA10\n1991), vacated on other grounds, 503 U. S. 978 (1992).\nOthers, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not\ninterpreting §78i(e) at all, but looked directly to §77m,\ndespite Lampf’s explicit selection of §78i(e)’s terms. Great\nRivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland\nIndustries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); Topalian\nv. Ehrman, 954 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992). Another\ncourt candidly acknowledged that §78i(e)’s text—unlike\n§77m’s—forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe\nless held that courts remain “free to apply to [§78i(e)] the\njudge-made doctrine of inquiry notice” as a “modest and\ntraditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,” since “Con\ngress could not have known when it enacted [§78i(e)] that\nthis section would someday provide the statute of limita\ntions for a wide range of securities frauds.” Tregenza v.\nGreat American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721–\n722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).\n   The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the\nissue before §1658(b)(1)’s enactment. See Betz v. Trainer\nWortham & Co., 519 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2008); New\nEngland Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst &\nYoung, LLP, 336 F. 3d 495, 500–501, and n. 3 (CA6 2003);\nIn re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F. 3d 1314,\n1325 (CA3 2002); see also Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito\nAguada v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 129 F. 3d 222, 224 (CA1\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n1997) (applying pre-Lampf rule under 15 U. S. C. §78aa–\n1). And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt\non a constructive-discovery view in dicta—of which the\nomniscient Congress of the Court’s imagining should also\nhave been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,\n175 F. 3d 699, 703–705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water\nhouse, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).\n   This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere\nnear establishing that the word “discovery” in §78i(e)\nmeant constructive rather than actual discovery despite\n§77m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read\n“discovery” differently in §1658(b)(1) and §77m, I would\nhold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita\ntions period for §10(b) claims. Since Merck points to no\nevidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter\nmore than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with\nthe Court that the suit was not time barred.\n   Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33–34,\nthat in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any\ndifference between actual and constructive discovery\nbecause of the presumption of reliance applicable in such\ncases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).\nIt seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis\ncussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price\nsignals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public\ninformation, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa\ntion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde\npendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a\nconstructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield\nthe same result, actual discovery is what §1658(b)(1)\nrequires to start the limitations period.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/78784/", "sha1": "54c5f19337abe336e73e8990039a92cef991baaf", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-27T23:44:09"}
