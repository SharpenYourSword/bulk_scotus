S. 549, 566\n(1995).\n   Recently we have endeavored to more sharply define\nand enforce limits on Congress\u2019 enumerated \u201c[p]ower . . .\n[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\u201d\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3. Lopez marked the first time\nin half a century that this Court held that an Act of Con\ngress exceeded its commerce power. We identified three\ncategories of activity that Congress\u2019 commerce power\nauthorizes it to regulate: (1) the use of the channels of\ninterstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of inter\nstate commerce; and (3) \u201cactivities having a substantial\nrelation to interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities\nthat substantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d 514 U. S.,\nat 558\u2013559. Emphasizing that we were unwilling to \u201ccon\nvert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause\nto a general police power,\u201d id., at 567, we struck down a\nban on the possession of firearms within a 1,000-foot\nradius of schools because the statute did not regulate an\nactivity that \u201csubstantially affect[ed]\u201d interstate com\nmerce, id., at 561.\n   Five years after Lopez, we reaffirmed the \u201csubstantial\neffects\u201d test in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598\n(2000). We rejected Congress\u2019 attempt to \u201cregulate none\nconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that\nconduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce,\u201d and\nheld unconstitutional the civil remedy portion of the Vio\nlence Against Women Act of 1994. Id., at 617, 619. We\ncould think of \u201cno better example of the police power,\nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and\nreposed in the States.\u201d Id., at 618.\n                           III\n  In upholding \u00a7931(a), the Ninth Circuit recognized that\nLopez and Morrison had \u201csignificantly altered the land\nscape of congressional power under the Commerce Clause\u201d\n4               ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbut held that it was guided \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d by Scar\nborough, supra. 565 F. 3d, at 643, 645. In Scarborough,\nthis Court construed 18 U. S. C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1970 ed.),\nwhich made it a crime for a felon to \u201creceiv[e], posses[s], or\ntranspor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce\u201d any fire\narm. 431 U. S., at 564. The question in that case was\nwhether the \u201cstatutorily required nexus between the\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon and commerce\u201d\ncould be satisfied by evidence that the gun had once trav\neled in interstate commerce. Ibid. The Court held that\nsuch evidence was sufficient, noting that the legislative\nhistory suggested that Congress wished to assert \u201c \u2018its full\nCommerce Clause power.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 571. No party alleged\nthat the statute exceeded Congress\u2019 authority, and the\nCourt did not hold that the statute was constitutional.\nThe Ninth Circuit concluded that Scarborough had \u201cim\nplicitly assumed the constitutionality of\u201d \u00a71202(a). 565\nF. 3d, at 645.\n  The Ninth Circuit discussed how it might apply Lopez\nand Morrison \u201cwhen traveling in uncharted waters\u201d but\nultimately concluded that it was \u201cbound by Scarborough,\u201d\nin which this Court had \u201cblessed\u201d a \u201cnearly identical juris\ndictional hook.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 648. Although it would\n\u201cgenerally analyze cases in the framework of th[e] three\n[Lopez] categories,\u201d the Ninth Circuit determined that\nScarborough had \u201ccarved out\u201d a separate constitutional\nniche for statutes like \u00a7931(a) and \u00a71202(a). 565 F. 3d, at\n646\u2013647. The Ninth Circuit thus upheld the statute with\nout \u201cengag[ing] in the careful parsing of post-Lopez case\nlaw that would otherwise be required.\u201d Id., at 648. The\ncourt recognized a tension between Scarborough and\nLopez but declined to \u201cdeviate from binding precedent.\u201d\n565 F. 3d, at 646.\n  The dissent argued that the court had \u201ceffectively ren\nder[ed] the Supreme Court\u2019s three-part Commerce Clause\nanalysis superfluous.\u201d Id., at 648 (opinion of Paez, J.).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nScarborough, the dissent explained, \u201cdecided only a ques\ntion of statutory interpretation.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 656. Sec\ntion 931 was, in the dissent\u2019s view, unconstitutional be\ncause applying Lopez, \u201cfelon-possession of body armor does\nnot have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\u201d 565\nF. 3d, at 648.\n   The Ninth Circuit is not alone in its confusion about\nScarborough and Lopez. The Tenth Circuit, also uphold\ning \u00a7931 under Scarborough, has observed that \u201c[l]ike our\nsister circuits, we see considerable tension between Scar\nborough and the three-category approach adopted by the\nSupreme Court in its recent Commerce Clause cases.\u201d\nUnited States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 636 (2006).1 These\nCircuits have determined that \u201c[a]ny doctrinal inconsis\ntency between Scarborough and the Supreme Court\u2019s more\nrecent decisions is not for [us] to remedy,\u201d ibid., and have\nstated their intent to follow Scarborough \u201cuntil the Su\npreme Court tells us otherwise.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 648 (inter\nnal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n                            IV\n  It is difficult to imagine a better case for certiorari.\nScarborough, as the lower courts have read it, cannot be\nreconciled with Lopez because it reduces the constitutional\nanalysis to the mere identification of a jurisdictional\nhook like the one in \u00a71202(a). See 593 F. 3d, at 1142\n(O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc) (\u201cThe majority\u2019s opinion makes Lopez superfluous\u201d).\nIn fact, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that \u201c[a]lthough\nthe body armor statute does not fit within any of the Lopez\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Other Courts of Appeals, considering the constitutionality of differ\n\nent possession statutes, have applied Scarborough similarly, although\nthe issue has divided some panels. See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 66\nF. 3d 569 (CA3 1995); id., at 595\u2013596 (Becker, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F. 3d 325 (CA7\n2010); id., at 337 (Manion, J., dissenting).\n6                 ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncategories, it is supported by the pre-Lopez precedent of\nScarborough.\u201d Patton, supra, at 634.\n   Recognizing the conflict between Lopez and their inter\npretation of Scarborough, the lower courts have cried out\nfor guidance from this Court. See 565 F. 3d, at 643\n(\u201c[A]bsent the Supreme Court or our en banc court telling\nus otherwise . . . the felon-in-possession of body armor\nstatute passes muster\u201d); Patton, supra, at 636 (\u201cWe sus\npect the Supreme Court will revisit this issue in an appro\npriate case\u2014maybe even this one\u201d). This Court has a duty\nto defend the integrity of its precedents, and we should\ngrant certiorari to affirm that Lopez provides the proper\nframework for a Commerce Clause analysis of this type.2\n   Further, the lower courts\u2019 reading of Scarborough, by\ntrumping the Lopez framework, could very well remove\nany limit on the commerce power. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of Scarborough seems to permit Congress to\nregulate or ban possession of any item that has ever been\noffered for sale or crossed state lines. Congress arguably\ncould outlaw \u201cthe theft of a Hershey kiss from a corner\nstore in Youngstown, Ohio, by a neighborhood juvenile on\nthe basis that the candy once traveled . . . to the store from\nHershey, Pennsylvania.\u201d United States v. Bishop, 66 F. 3d\n569, 596 (CA3 1995) (Becker, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Government actually conceded at\noral argument in the Ninth Circuit that Congress could\nban possession of french fries that have been offered for\nsale in interstate commerce.\n   Such an expansion of federal authority would trespass\non traditional state police powers. See Morrison, 529\nU. S., at 618; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566; id., at 584 (THOMAS,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 I adhere to my previously stated views on the proper scope of the\n\nCommerce Clause. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (concurring opinion); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n627 (2000) (same); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 57 (2005) (dissenting\nopinion).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Before Congress enacted \u00a7931, the\nmajority of States already had employed their police pow\ners to address body armor and its use or possession by\ncriminals. The States\u2019 different regimes range from laws\nrequiring sales of body armor to be face-to-face, to laws\nincreasing sentences for criminals who commit certain\ncrimes with weapons and body armor, to no regulation at\nall.3 Cf. Lopez, supra, at 581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)\n(noting that more than 40 States had already outlawed\ngun possession at or near schools, and observing that \u201cthe\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\nmeasures\u201d).\n                        *    *     *\n  Fifteen years ago in Lopez, we took a significant step\ntoward reaffirming this Court\u2019s commitment to proper\nconstitutional limits on Congress\u2019 commerce power. If the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 At  least 31 States have some form of body armor regulation. For\ninstance, Maryland makes it a crime to wear body armor while commit\nting certain crimes, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a74\u2013106 (Lexis Supp.\n2010), and also prohibits individuals who have been convicted of crimes\nof violence or drug crimes from possessing, owning, or using body\narmor, although individuals may be exempted through a permit sys\ntem. \u00a74\u2013107 (Lexis 2002). Virginia makes it a Class 4 felony to wear\nbody armor while possessing a knife or firearm and committing a drug\nor violence offense. Va. Code Ann. \u00a718.2\u2013287.2 (Lexis 2009). North\nCarolina, by comparison, enhances all felony offenses by one class level\nif the offender wears or possesses body armor during the commission of\nthe felony. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a715A\u20131340.16C (Lexis 2009). The\nStates also define \u201cbody armor\u201d in many different ways. See M.\nPuckett, Body Armor: A Survey of State & Federal Law (2d ed. 2004).\nMontana, Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Nebraska, and Rhode Island, among\nothers, have elected not to regulate body armor at all. See United\nStates v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 631, n. 7 (CA10 2006) (categorizing the\nvarious state schemes).\n8              ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nLopez framework is to have any ongoing vitality, it is up to\nthis Court to prevent it from being undermined by a 1977\nprecedent that does not squarely address the constitu\ntional issue. Lower courts have recognized this problem\nand asked us to grant certiorari. I would do so.\n",

Emphasizing that we were unwilling to \u201ccon\nvert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause\nto a general police power,\u201d id., at 567, we struck down a\nban on the possession of firearms within a 1,000-foot\nradius of schools because the statute did not regulate an\nactivity that \u201csubstantially affect[ed]\u201d interstate com\nmerce, id., at 561.\n   Five years after Lopez, we reaffirmed the \u201csubstantial\neffects\u201d test in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598\n(2000). We rejected Congress\u2019 attempt to \u201cregulate none\nconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that\nconduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce,\u201d and\nheld unconstitutional the civil remedy portion of the Vio\nlence Against Women Act of 1994. Id., at 617, 619. We\ncould think of \u201cno better example of the police power,\nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and\nreposed in the States.\u201d Id., at 618.\n                           III\n  In upholding \u00a7931(a), the Ninth Circuit recognized that\nLopez and Morrison had \u201csignificantly altered the land\nscape of congressional power under the Commerce Clause\u201d\n4               ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbut held that it was guided \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d by Scar\nborough, supra. 565 F. 3d, at 643, 645. In Scarborough,\nthis Court construed 18 U. S. C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1970 ed.),\nwhich made it a crime for a felon to \u201creceiv[e], posses[s], or\ntranspor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce\u201d any fire\narm. 431 U. S., at 564. The question in that case was\nwhether the \u201cstatutorily required nexus between the\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon and commerce\u201d\ncould be satisfied by evidence that the gun had once trav\neled in interstate commerce. Ibid. The Court held that\nsuch evidence was sufficient, noting that the legislative\nhistory suggested that Congress wished to assert \u201c \u2018its full\nCommerce Clause power.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 571. No party alleged\nthat the statute exceeded Congress\u2019 authority, and the\nCourt did not hold that the statute was constitutional.\nThe Ninth Circuit concluded that Scarborough had \u201cim\nplicitly assumed the constitutionality of\u201d \u00a71202(a). 565\nF. 3d, at 645.\n  The Ninth Circuit discussed how it might apply Lopez\nand Morrison \u201cwhen traveling in uncharted waters\u201d but\nultimately concluded that it was \u201cbound by Scarborough,\u201d\nin which this Court had \u201cblessed\u201d a \u201cnearly identical juris\ndictional hook.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 648. Although it would\n\u201cgenerally analyze cases in the framework of th[e] three\n[Lopez] categories,\u201d the Ninth Circuit determined that\nScarborough had \u201ccarved out\u201d a separate constitutional\nniche for statutes like \u00a7931(a) and \u00a71202(a). 565 F. 3d, at\n646\u2013647. The Ninth Circuit thus upheld the statute with\nout \u201cengag[ing] in the careful parsing of post-Lopez case\nlaw that would otherwise be required.\u201d Id., at 648. The\ncourt recognized a tension between Scarborough and\nLopez but declined to \u201cdeviate from binding precedent.\u201d\n565 F. 3d, at 646.\n  The dissent argued that the court had \u201ceffectively ren\nder[ed] the Supreme Court\u2019s three-part Commerce Clause\nanalysis superfluous.\u201d Id., at 648 (opinion of Paez, J.).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nScarborough, the dissent explained, \u201cdecided only a ques\ntion of statutory interpretation.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 656. Sec\ntion 931 was, in the dissent\u2019s view, unconstitutional be\ncause applying Lopez, \u201cfelon-possession of body armor does\nnot have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\u201d 565\nF. 3d, at 648.\n   The Ninth Circuit is not alone in its confusion about\nScarborough and Lopez. The Tenth Circuit, also uphold\ning \u00a7931 under Scarborough, has observed that \u201c[l]ike our\nsister circuits, we see considerable tension between Scar\nborough and the three-category approach adopted by the\nSupreme Court in its recent Commerce Clause cases.\u201d\nUnited States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 636 (2006).1 These\nCircuits have determined that \u201c[a]ny doctrinal inconsis\ntency between Scarborough and the Supreme Court\u2019s more\nrecent decisions is not for [us] to remedy,\u201d ibid., and have\nstated their intent to follow Scarborough \u201cuntil the Su\npreme Court tells us otherwise.\u201d 565 F. 3d, at 648 (inter\nnal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n                            IV\n  It is difficult to imagine a better case for certiorari.\nScarborough, as the lower courts have read it, cannot be\nreconciled with Lopez because it reduces the constitutional\nanalysis to the mere identification of a jurisdictional\nhook like the one in \u00a71202(a). See 593 F. 3d, at 1142\n(O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc) (\u201cThe majority\u2019s opinion makes Lopez superfluous\u201d).\nIn fact, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that \u201c[a]lthough\nthe body armor statute does not fit within any of the Lopez\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Other Courts of Appeals, considering the constitutionality of differ\n\nent possession statutes, have applied Scarborough similarly, although\nthe issue has divided some panels. See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 66\nF. 3d 569 (CA3 1995); id., at 595\u2013596 (Becker, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F. 3d 325 (CA7\n2010); id., at 337 (Manion, J., dissenting).\n6                 ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncategories, it is supported by the pre-Lopez precedent of\nScarborough.\u201d Patton, supra, at 634.\n   Recognizing the conflict between Lopez and their inter\npretation of Scarborough, the lower courts have cried out\nfor guidance from this Court. See 565 F. 3d, at 643\n(\u201c[A]bsent the Supreme Court or our en banc court telling\nus otherwise . . . the felon-in-possession of body armor\nstatute passes muster\u201d); Patton, supra, at 636 (\u201cWe sus\npect the Supreme Court will revisit this issue in an appro\npriate case\u2014maybe even this one\u201d). This Court has a duty\nto defend the integrity of its precedents, and we should\ngrant certiorari to affirm that Lopez provides the proper\nframework for a Commerce Clause analysis of this type.2\n   Further, the lower courts\u2019 reading of Scarborough, by\ntrumping the Lopez framework, could very well remove\nany limit on the commerce power. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation of Scarborough seems to permit Congress to\nregulate or ban possession of any item that has ever been\noffered for sale or crossed state lines. Congress arguably\ncould outlaw \u201cthe theft of a Hershey kiss from a corner\nstore in Youngstown, Ohio, by a neighborhood juvenile on\nthe basis that the candy once traveled . . . to the store from\nHershey, Pennsylvania.\u201d United States v. Bishop, 66 F. 3d\n569, 596 (CA3 1995) (Becker, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Government actually conceded at\noral argument in the Ninth Circuit that Congress could\nban possession of french fries that have been offered for\nsale in interstate commerce.\n   Such an expansion of federal authority would trespass\non traditional state police powers. See Morrison, 529\nU. S., at 618; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566; id., at 584 (THOMAS,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 I adhere to my previously stated views on the proper scope of the\n\nCommerce Clause. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (concurring opinion); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n627 (2000) (same); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 57 (2005) (dissenting\nopinion).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[W]e always have rejected readings of the\nCommerce Clause and the scope of federal power that\nwould permit Congress to exercise a police power . . .\u201d\n(emphasis in original)). Before Congress enacted \u00a7931, the\nmajority of States already had employed their police pow\ners to address body armor and its use or possession by\ncriminals. The States\u2019 different regimes range from laws\nrequiring sales of body armor to be face-to-face, to laws\nincreasing sentences for criminals who commit certain\ncrimes with weapons and body armor, to no regulation at\nall.3 Cf. Lopez, supra, at 581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)\n(noting that more than 40 States had already outlawed\ngun possession at or near schools, and observing that \u201cthe\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\nmeasures\u201d).\n                        *    *     *\n  Fifteen years ago in Lopez, we took a significant step\ntoward reaffirming this Court\u2019s commitment to proper\nconstitutional limits on Congress\u2019 commerce power. If the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 At  least 31 States have some form of body armor regulation. For\ninstance, Maryland makes it a crime to wear body armor while commit\nting certain crimes, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a74\u2013106 (Lexis Supp.\n2010), and also prohibits individuals who have been convicted of crimes\nof violence or drug crimes from possessing, owning, or using body\narmor, although individuals may be exempted through a permit sys\ntem. \u00a74\u2013107 (Lexis 2002). Virginia makes it a Class 4 felony to wear\nbody armor while possessing a knife or firearm and committing a drug\nor violence offense. Va. Code Ann. \u00a718.2\u2013287.2 (Lexis 2009). North\nCarolina, by comparison, enhances all felony offenses by one class level\nif the offender wears or possesses body armor during the commission of\nthe felony. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a715A\u20131340.16C (Lexis 2009). The\nStates also define \u201cbody armor\u201d in many different ways. See M.\nPuckett, Body Armor: A Survey of State & Federal Law (2d ed. 2004).\nMontana, Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Nebraska, and Rhode Island, among\nothers, have elected not to regulate body armor at all. See United\nStates v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 631, n. 7 (CA10 2006) (categorizing the\nvarious state schemes).\n8              ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nLopez framework is to have any ongoing vitality, it is up to\nthis Court to prevent it from being undermined by a 1977\nprecedent that does not squarely address the constitu\ntional issue. Lower courts have recognized this problem\nand asked us to grant certiorari. I would do so.\n</pre>",
