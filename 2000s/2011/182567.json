Argued October 4, 2010\u2014Decided January 11, 2011\nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as\n the \u201cmeans test\u201d to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do\n pay them. The means test instructs a debtor to determine his \u201cdis\n posable income\u201d\u2014the amount he has available to reimburse credi\n tors\u2014by deducting from his current monthly income \u201camounts rea\n sonably necessary to be expended\u201d for, inter alia, \u201cmaintenance or\n support.\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i). For a debtor whose income is\n above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which ex\n penses qualify as \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d As\n relevant here, the statute provides that \u201c[t]he debtor\u2019s monthly ex\n penses shall be the debtor\u2019s applicable monthly expense amounts\n specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other\n Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for\n the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\n    The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for\n basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers\u2019\n ability to pay overdue taxes. The IRS also creates supplemental\n guidelines known as the \u201cCollection Financial Standards,\u201d which de\n scribe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them\n mean. The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation\n expenses, divided into vehicle \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d and vehicle \u201cOper\n ating Costs.\u201d The Collection Financial Standards explain that \u201cOwn\n ership Costs\u201d cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automo\n bile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car\n financing data. The Collection Financial Standards further state\n that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance\n2               RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for ownership costs.\n       When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he\n    listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor. Among his assets,\n    Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt. In determining\n    his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduc\n    tion of $471, the full amount specified in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table,\n    as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs. Based\n    on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan\n    that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unse\n    cured debt. FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct\n    all of Ransom\u2019s disposable income to unsecured creditors. FIA con\n    tended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership al\n    lowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.\n    Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.\n    The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld: A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take\n the car-ownership deduction. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) This Court\u2019s interpretation begins with the language of the\n Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only \u201cap\n plicable\u201d expense amounts listed in the Standards. Because the Code\n does not define the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d the term carries its ordi\n nary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit. What makes\n an expense amount \u201capplicable\u201d in this sense is most naturally un\n derstood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor\u2019s financial\n circumstances. Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to\n claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if\n that deduction is appropriate for him. And a deduction is so appro\n priate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the\n table during the life of the plan. Had Congress not wanted to sepa\n rate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it\n could have omitted the term \u201capplicable\u201d altogether. Without that\n word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each cate\n gory listed in the Standards. Interpreting the statute to require a\n threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that \u201capplicable\u201d\n carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.\n    This reading draws support from the statute\u2019s context and purpose.\n The Code initially defines a debtor\u2019s disposable income as his \u201ccur\n rent monthly income . . . less amounts reasonably necessary to be ex\n pended.\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2). It then instructs that such reasonably neces\n sary amounts \u201cshall be determined in accordance with\u201d the means\n test. \u00a71325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to ap\n proximate the debtor\u2019s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a\n debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incur\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  ring an expense in the relevant category. Further, the statute\u2019s pur\n  pose\u2014to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can af\n  ford\u2014is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with\n  the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\u2019s ability to afford repayment.\n  Pp. 6\u20139.\n     (b) The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car\n  loan or lease. The expense amount listed ($471) is the average\n  monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended\n  to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a\n  car. Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate \u201cOperat\n  ing Costs\u201d deduction. A person who owns a car free and clear is enti\n  tled to the \u201cOperating Costs\u201d deduction for all driving-related ex\n  penses. But such a person may not claim the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d\n  deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car\n  loan or lease. The IRS\u2019 Collection Financial Standards reinforce this\n  conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make\n  no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduc\n  tion. Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no ex\n  pense in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category, and that expense amount is\n  therefore not \u201capplicable\u201d to him. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (c) Ransom\u2019s arguments to the contrary\u2014an alternative interpreta\n  tion of the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d an objection to the Court\u2019s view of\n  the scope of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category, and a criticism of the\n  policy implications of the Court\u2019s approach\u2014are unpersuasive.\n  Pp. 11\u201318.\n577 F. 3d 1026, affirmed.\n\n  KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

A. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 11, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code enables an individ\nual to obtain a discharge of his debts if he pays his credi\ntors a portion of his monthly income in accordance with a\ncourt-approved plan. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71301 et seq. To deter\nmine how much income the debtor is capable of paying,\nChapter 13 uses a statutory formula known as the \u201cmeans\ntest.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. III), 1325(b)(3)(A)\n(2006 ed.). The means test instructs a debtor to deduct\nspecified expenses from his current monthly income. The\nresult is his \u201cdisposable income\u201d\u2014the amount he has\navailable to reimburse creditors. \u00a71325(b)(2).\n   This case concerns the specified expense for vehicle\nownership costs. We must determine whether a debtor\nlike petitioner Jason Ransom who owns his car outright,\nand so does not make loan or lease payments, may claim\nan allowance for car-ownership costs (thereby reducing the\namount he will repay creditors). We hold that the text,\ncontext, and purpose of the statutory provision at issue\npreclude this result. A debtor who does not make loan or\n2              RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N.

A. v. United States, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1). In particular, Congress\nadopted the means test\u2014\u201c[t]he heart of [BAPCPA\u2019s] con\nsumer bankruptcy reforms,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u201331, pt. 1,\np. 2 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), and the home of the\nstatutory language at issue here\u2014to help ensure that\ndebtors who can pay creditors do pay them. See, e.g., ibid.\n(under BAPCPA, \u201cdebtors [will] repay creditors the maxi\nmum they can afford\u201d).\n   In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a\nformula to calculate a debtor\u2019s disposable income, which\nthe debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a\ncourt-approved plan generally lasting from three to five\nyears. \u00a7\u00a71325(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4).1 The statute defines\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d less\n\u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d for \u201cmain\ntenance or support,\u201d business expenditures, and certain\ncharitable contributions. \u00a7\u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). For a\ndebtor whose income is above the median for his State, the\nmeans test identifies which expenses qualify as \u201camounts\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Chapter 13 borrows the means test from Chapter 7, where it is used\n\nas a screening mechanism to determine whether a Chapter 7 proceed\ning is appropriate. Individuals who file for bankruptcy relief under\nChapter 7 liquidate their nonexempt assets, rather than dedicate their\nfuture income, to repay creditors. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726. If\nthe debtor\u2019s Chapter 7 petition discloses that his disposable income as\ncalculated by the means test exceeds a certain threshold, the petition is\npresumptively abusive. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i). If the debtor cannot rebut the\npresumption, the court may dismiss the case or, with the debtor\u2019s\nconsent, convert it into a Chapter 13 proceeding. \u00a7707(b)(1).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d The test supplants\nthe pre-BAPCPA practice of calculating debtors\u2019 reason\nable expenses on a case-by-case basis, which led to varying\nand often inconsistent determinations. See, e.g., In re\nSlusher, 359 B. R. 290, 294 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 2007).\n  Under the means test, a debtor calculating his \u201crea\nsonably necessary\u201d expenses is directed to claim allow\nances for defined living expenses, as well as for secured\nand priority debt. \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(iv). As relevant\nhere, the statute provides:\n       \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s\n     applicable monthly expense amounts specified under\n     the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n     debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories\n     specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the\n     Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which\n     the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\nThese are the principal amounts that the debtor can claim\nas his reasonable living expenses and thereby shield from\ncreditors.\n  The National and Local Standards referenced in this\nprovision are tables that the IRS prepares listing stan\ndardized expense amounts for basic necessities.2 The IRS\nuses the Standards to help calculate taxpayers\u2019 ability to\npay overdue taxes. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a77122(d)(2). The IRS\nalso prepares supplemental guidelines known as the Col\nlection Financial Standards, which describe how to use the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The National Standards designate allowances for six categories of\n\nexpenses: (1) food; (2) housekeeping supplies; (3) apparel and services;\n(4) personal care products and services; (5) out-of-pocket health care\ncosts; and (6) miscellaneous expenses.

The\nCollection Financial Standards further instruct that, in\nthe tax-collection context, \u201c[i]f a taxpayer has no car pay\nment, . . . only the operating costs portion of the transpor\ntation standard is used to come up with the allowable\ntransportation expense.\u201d Ibid.\n                           B\n  Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in July\n2006.

In de\ntermining those expenses, Ransom claimed a car\nownership deduction of $471 for the Camry, the full\namount specified in the IRS\u2019s \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table.\nId., at 49. Ransom listed a separate deduction of $338 for\ncar-operating costs. Ibid. Based on these figures, Ransom\nhad disposable income of $210.55 per month. Id., at 53.\n  Ransom proposed a 5-year plan that would result in\nrepayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt.\nId., at 55. FIA objected to confirmation of the plan on the\nground that it did not direct all of Ransom\u2019s disposable\nincome to unsecured creditors. Id., at 64. In particular,\nFIA argued that Ransom should not have claimed the car\nownership allowance because he does not make loan or\nlease payments on his car. Id., at 67. FIA noted that\nwithout this allowance, Ransom\u2019s disposable income would\nbe $681.55\u2014the $210.55 he reported plus the $471 he\ndeducted for vehicle ownership. Id., at 71. The difference\nover the 60 months of the plan amounts to about $28,000.\n                              C\n   The Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of Ransom\u2019s\nplan.

As noted, the provision of\nthe Code central to the decision of this case states:\n       \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s\n     applicable monthly expense amounts specified under\n     the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n     debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories\n     specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the\n     [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d\n     \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\nThe key word in this provision is \u201capplicable\u201d: A debtor\nmay claim not all, but only \u201capplicable\u201d expense amounts\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Compare In re Ransom, 577 F. 3d 1026, 1027 (CA9 2009) (case be\n\nlow), with In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934, 935 (CA8 2009) (permitting\nthe allowance), In re Tate, 571 F. 3d 423, 424 (CA5 2009) (same), and\nIn re Ross-Tousey, 549 F. 3d 1148, 1162 (CA7 2008) (same). The ques\ntion has also divided bankruptcy courts. See, e.g., In re Canales, 377\nB. R. 658, 662 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2007) (citing dozens of cases reach\ning opposing results).\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlisted in the Standards. Whether Ransom may claim the\n$471 car-ownership deduction accordingly turns on\nwhether that expense amount is \u201capplicable\u201d to him.\n   Because the Code does not define \u201capplicable,\u201d we look\nto the ordinary meaning of the term. See, e.g., Hamilton\nv. Lanning, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6). \u201cAp\nplicable\u201d means \u201ccapable of being applied: having rele\nvance\u201d or \u201cfit, suitable, or right to be applied: appropriate.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 105 (2002).\nSee also New Oxford American Dictionary 74 (2d ed. 2005)\n(\u201crelevant or appropriate\u201d); 1 Oxford English Dictionary\n575 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[c]apable of being applied\u201d or \u201c[f]it or\nsuitable for its purpose, appropriate\u201d). So an expense\namount is \u201capplicable\u201d within the plain meaning of the\nstatute when it is appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.\n   What makes an expense amount \u201capplicable\u201d in this\nsense (appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit) is most natu\nrally understood to be its correspondence to an individual\ndebtor\u2019s financial circumstances. Rather than authorizing\nall debtors to take deductions in all listed categories,\nCongress established a filter: A debtor may claim a deduc\ntion from a National or Local Standard table (like \u201c[Car]\nOwnership Costs\u201d) if but only if that deduction is appro\npriate for him. And a deduction is so appropriate only if\nthe debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered\nby the table\u2014that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind\nof expense during the life of the plan. The statute under\nscores the necessity of making such an individualized\ndetermination by referring to \u201cthe debtor\u2019s applicable\nmonthly expense amounts,\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis\nadded)\u2014in other words, the expense amounts applicable\n(appropriate, etc.) to each particular debtor. Identifying\nthese amounts requires looking at the financial situation\nof the debtor and asking whether a National or Local\nStandard table is relevant to him.\n   If Congress had not wanted to separate in this way\n8             RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndebtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do\nnot, it could have omitted the term \u201capplicable\u201d altogether.\nWithout that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a\ndeduction for each category listed in the Standards. Con\ngress presumably included \u201capplicable\u201d to achieve a differ\nent result. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004)\n(\u201c[W]e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever\npossible\u201d). Interpreting the statute to require a threshold\ndetermination of eligibility ensures that the term \u201cappli\ncable\u201d carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.\n   This reading of \u201capplicable\u201d also draws support from the\nstatutory context. The Code initially defines a debtor\u2019s\ndisposable income as his \u201ccurrent monthly income . . . less\namounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2)\n(emphasis added).       The statute then instructs that\n\u201c[a]mounts reasonably necessary to be expended . . . shall\nbe determined in accordance with\u201d the means test.\n\u00a71325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to\napproximate the debtor\u2019s reasonable expenditures on\nessential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for\na deduction by actually incurring an expense in the rele\nvant category. If a debtor will not have a particular kind\nof expense during his plan, an allowance to cover that cost\nis not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the\nstatute.5\n   Finally, consideration of BAPCPA\u2019s purpose strengthens\nour reading of the term \u201capplicable.\u201d Congress designed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This interpretation also avoids the anomalous result of granting\n\npreferential treatment to individuals with above-median income.\nBecause the means test does not apply to Chapter 13 debtors whose\nincomes are below the median, those debtors must prove on a case-by\ncase basis that each claimed expense is reasonably necessary. See\n\u00a7\u00a71325(b)(2) and (3). If a below-median-income debtor cannot take a\ndeduction for a nonexistent expense, we doubt Congress meant to\nprovide such an allowance to an above-median-income debtor\u2014the very\nkind of debtor whose perceived abuse of the bankruptcy system in\nspired Congress to enact the means test.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

R. Rep., at 2. This purpose\nis best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent\nwith the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\u2019s ability to\nafford repayment. Cf. Hamilton, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14) (rejecting an interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code\nthat \u201cwould produce [the] senseless resul[t]\u201d of \u201cdeny[ing]\ncreditors payments that the debtor could easily make\u201d).\nRequiring a debtor to incur the kind of expenses for which\nhe claims a means-test deduction thus advances\nBAPCPA\u2019s objectives.\n    Because we conclude that a person cannot claim an\nallowance for vehicle-ownership costs unless he has some\nexpense falling within that category, the question in this\ncase becomes: What expenses does the vehicle-ownership\ncategory cover? If it covers loan and lease payments alone,\nRansom does not qualify, because he has no such expense.\nOnly if that category also covers other costs associ\nated with having a car would Ransom be entitled to this\ndeduction.\n    The less inclusive understanding is the right one: The\nownership category encompasses the costs of a car loan or\nlease and nothing more. As noted earlier, the numerical\namounts listed in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table are \u201cbase[d]\n. . . on the five-year average of new and used car financing\ndata compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.\u201d App. to\nBrief for Respondent 3a. In other words, the sum $471 is\nthe average monthly payment for loans and leases na\ntionwide; it is not intended to estimate other conceivable\nexpenses associated with maintaining a car. The Stan\ndards do account for those additional expenses, but in a\ndifferent way: They are mainly the province of the sepa\nrate deduction for vehicle \u201cOperating Costs,\u201d which in\nclude payments for \u201c[v]ehicle insurance, . . . maintenance,\nfuel, state and local registration, required inspection,\n10            RANSOM v.

App. to Brief for Respon\ndent 3a; see supra, at 4. Although the statute does not\nincorporate the IRS\u2019s guidelines, courts may consult this\nmaterial in interpreting the National and Local Stan\ndards; after all, the IRS uses those tables for a similar\npurpose\u2014to determine how much money a delinquent\ntaxpayer can afford to pay the Government. The guide\nlines of course cannot control if they are at odds with the\nstatutory language. But here, the Collection Financial\nStandards\u2019 treatment of the car-ownership deduction\nreinforces our conclusion that, under the statute, a debtor\nseeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or\nlease payments.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 In addition, the IRS has categorized taxes, including those associ\n\nated with car ownership, as an \u201cOther Necessary Expens[e],\u201d for which\na debtor may take a deduction. See App. to Brief for Respondent 26a;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 4.\n   7 Because the dissent appears to misunderstand our use of the Collec\n\ntion Financial Standards, and because it may be important for future\ncases to be clear on this point, we emphasize again that the statute\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Accordingly, the\ncar-ownership expense amount is not \u201capplicable\u201d to him,\nand the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction.\n                             III\n  Ransom\u2019s argument to the contrary relies on a different\ninterpretation of the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d an objection to\nour view of the scope of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category,\nand a criticism of the policy implications of our approach.\nWe do not think these claims persuasive.\n                              A\n   Ransom first offers another understanding of the term\n\u201capplicable.\u201d A debtor, he says, determines his \u201capplica\nble\u201d deductions by locating the box in each National or\nLocal Standard table that corresponds to his geographic\nlocation, income, family size, or number of cars. Under\nthis approach, a debtor \u201cconsult[s] the table[s] alone\u201d to\ndetermine his appropriate expense amounts. Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues\nthat his \u201capplicable\u201d allowance is the sum listed in the\nfirst column of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table ($471); if he\nhad a second vehicle, the amount in the second column\n($332) would also be \u201capplicable.\u201d On this approach, the\nword \u201capplicable\u201d serves a function wholly internal to the\ntables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduc\ntion is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndoes not \u201cincorporat[e]\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpor[t]\u201d the IRS\u2019s guidance.\nPost, at 1, 4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The dissent questions what possible\nbasis except incorporation could justify our consulting the IRS\u2019s view,\npost, at 4, n., but we think that basis obvious: The IRS creates the\nNational and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them\nas it deems necessary, and uses them every day. The agency might,\ntherefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not control\nling) to say about them.\n12          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndebtor to the correct box (and associated dollar amount of\ndeduction) within every table.\n   This alternative reading of \u201capplicable\u201d fails to comport\nwith the statute\u2019s text, context, or purpose. As intimated\nearlier, supra, at 7\u20138, Ransom\u2019s interpretation would\nrender the term \u201capplicable\u201d superfluous. Assume Con\ngress had omitted that word and simply authorized a\ndeduction of \u201cthe debtor\u2019s monthly expense amounts\u201d\nspecified in the Standards. That language, most naturally\nread, would direct each debtor to locate the box in every\ntable corresponding to his location, income, family size, or\nnumber of cars and to deduct the amount stated. In other\nwords, the language would instruct the debtor to use the\nexact approach Ransom urges. The word \u201capplicable\u201d is\nnot necessary to accomplish that result; it is necessary\nonly for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to\nmake use of the tables from those who are not. Further,\nRansom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d would sever the connec\ntion between the means test and the statutory provision it\nis meant to implement\u2014the authorization of an allowance\nfor (but only for) \u201creasonably necessary\u201d expenses. Ex\npenses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of\nas reasonably necessary. And finally, Ransom\u2019s interpre\ntation would run counter to the statute\u2019s overall purpose of\nensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they\ncan\u2014here, by shielding some $28,000 that he does not in\nfact need for loan or lease payments.\n   As against all this, Ransom argues that his reading\nis necessary to account for the means test\u2019s distinction\nbetween \u201capplicable\u201d and \u201cactual\u201d expenses\u2014more fully\nstated, between the phrase \u201capplicable monthly expense\namounts\u201d specified in the Standards and the phrase \u201cac\ntual monthly expenses for . . . Other Necessary Expenses.\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added). The latter phrase\nenables a debtor to deduct his actual expenses in particu\nlar categories that the IRS designates relating mainly to\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Internal Revenue Manual\n\u00a75.15.1.10(1), http://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/ irm_05-015\n001.html#d0e1381. According to Ransom, \u201capplicable\u201d\ncannot mean the same thing as \u201cactual.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 40. He thus concludes that \u201can \u2018applicable\u2019 expense\ncan be claimed [under the means test] even if no \u2018actual\u2019\nexpense was incurred.\u201d Ibid.\n   Our interpretation of the statute, however, equally\navoids conflating \u201capplicable\u201d with \u201cactual\u201d costs. Al\nthough the expense amounts in the Standards apply only\nif the debtor incurs the relevant expense, the debtor\u2019s out\nof-pocket cost may well not control the amount of the\ndeduction. If a debtor\u2019s actual expenses exceed the\namounts listed in the tables, for example, the debtor may\nclaim an allowance only for the specified sum, rather than\nfor his real expenditures.8 For the Other Necessary Ex\npense categories, by contrast, the debtor may deduct his\nactual expenses, no matter how high they are.9 Our read\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The parties and the Solicitor General as amicus curiae dispute the\n\nproper deduction for a debtor who has expenses that are lower than the\namounts listed in the Local Standards. Ransom argues that a debtor\nmay claim the specified expense amount in full regardless of his out-of\npocket costs. Brief for Petitioner 24\u201327. The Government concurs with\nthis view, provided (as we require) that a debtor has some expense\nrelating to the deduction. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19\u201321. FIA, relying on the IRS\u2019s practice, contends to the contrary that\na debtor may claim only his actual expenditures in this circumstance.\nBrief for Respondent 12, 45\u201346 (arguing that the Local Standards\nfunction as caps). We decline to resolve this issue. Because Ransom\nincurs no ownership expense at all, the car-ownership allowance is not\napplicable to him in the first instance. Ransom is therefore not entitled\nto a deduction under either approach.\n  9 For the same reason, the allowance for \u201capplicable monthly expense\n\namounts\u201d at issue here differs from the additional allowances that the\ndissent cites for the deduction of actual expenditures. See post, at 3\u20134\n(noting allowances for \u201cactual expenses\u201d for care of an elderly or chroni\ncally ill household member, \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II), and for home energy\ncosts, \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V)).\n14            RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning of the means test thus gives full effect to \u201cthe distinc\ntion between \u2018applicable\u2019 and \u2018actual\u2019 without taking a\nfurther step to conclude that \u2018applicable\u2019 means \u2018nonexis\ntent.\u2019 \u201d In re Ross-Tousey, 368 B. R. 762, 765 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nED Wis. 2007), rev\u2019d, 549 F. 3d 1148 (CA7 2008).\n   Finally, Ransom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d may not even\nanswer the essential question: whether a debtor may\nclaim a deduction. \u201c[C]onsult[ing] the table[s] alone\u201d to\ndetermine a debtor\u2019s deduction, as Ransom urges us to do,\nReply Brief for Petitioner 16, often will not be sufficient\nbecause the tables are not self-defining. This case pro\nvides a prime example. The \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table\nfeatures two columns labeled \u201cFirst Car\u201d and \u201cSecond\nCar.\u201d See supra, at 4. Standing alone, the table does not\nspecify whether it refers to the first and second cars owned\n(as Ransom avers), or the first and second cars for which\nthe debtor incurs ownership costs (as FIA maintains)\u2014and\nso the table does not resolve the issue in dispute.10 See\nIn re Kimbro, 389 B. R. 518, 533 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6\n2008) (Fulton, J., dissenting) (\u201c[O]ne cannot really \u2018just\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The interpretive problem is not, as the dissent suggests, \u201cwhether\nto claim a deduction for one car or for two,\u201d post, at 3, but rather\nwhether to claim a deduction for any car that is owned if the debtor has\nno ownership costs. Indeed, if we had to decide this question on the\nbasis of the table alone, we might well decide that a debtor who does\nnot make loan or lease payments cannot claim an allowance. The table,\nafter all, is titled \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d\u2014suggesting that it applies to\nthose debtors who incur such costs. And as noted earlier, the dollar\namounts in the table represent average automobile loan and lease\npayments nationwide (with all other car-related expenses approxi\nmated in the separate \u201cOperating Costs\u201d table). See supra, at 9\u201310.\nRansom himself concedes that not every debtor falls within the terms of\nthis table; he would exclude, and thus prohibit from taking a deduction,\na person who does not own a car. Brief for Petitioner 33. In like\nmanner, the four corners of the table appear to exclude an additional\ngroup\u2014debtors like Ransom who own their cars free and clear and so\ndo not make the loan or lease payments that constitute \u201cOwnership\nCosts.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

Some amount of interpretation\nis necessary to decide what the deduction is for and\nwhether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought\nback full circle to our prior analysis.\n                               B\n  Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership\ndeduction as covering no more than loan and lease pay\nments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the\nmeans test that provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the\ndebtor shall not include any payments for debts.\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The car-ownership deduction cannot\ncomprise only loan and lease payments, Ransom contends,\nbecause those payments are always debts. See Brief for\nPetitioner 28, 44\u201345.\n  Ransom ignores that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence\ngoverns the full panoply of deductions under the National\nand Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense\ncategories. We hesitate to rely on that general provision\nto interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction\nbecause Congress did not draft the former with the latter\nspecially in mind; any friction between the two likely\nreflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board\nexclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particu\nlar IRS allowance.11 Further, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sen\ntence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to\nauthorize, deductions. It cannot establish an allowance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Because Ransom does not make payments on his car, we need not\n\nand do not resolve how the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence affects the\nvehicle-ownership deduction when a debtor has a loan or lease expense.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n. 5 (offering alterna\ntive views on this question); Tr. of Oral Arg. 51\u201352.\n16          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor non-loan or -lease ownership costs that no National or\nLocal Standard covers. Accordingly, the \u201cnotwithstand\ning\u201d sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the\n\u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table does not apply to a debtor whose\ncar is not encumbered.\n                              C\n  Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test\nis necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by\nCongress. At the outset, we note that the policy concerns\nRansom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates:\nHis interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate\nBAPCPA\u2019s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote\ntheir full disposable income to repaying creditors. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139. We nonetheless address each of Ransom\u2019s\npolicy arguments in turn.\n  Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our\ninterpretation, \u201c[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing\nto take place while they still have a few car payments left,\nthus retaining an ownership deduction which they would\nlose if they filed just after making their last payment.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 54. Indeed, a debtor with only a single\ncar payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim\na monthly ownership deduction. Id., at 15, 52.\n  But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a stan\ndardized formula like the means test, even more under\nRansom\u2019s reading than under ours. Such formulas are by\ntheir nature over- and under-inclusive. In eliminating the\npre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median\nincome debtors\u2019 expenses, on the ground that it leant itself\nto abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculi\narity that a brighter-line test produces. And Ransom\u2019s\nalternative reading of the statute would spawn its own\nanomalies\u2014even placing to one side the fundamental\nstrangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or\nlease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts. On Ransom\u2019s view, for example, a debtor entering\nbankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car\u2014\u201can\nold, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would] si[t] on cinder\nblocks in his backyard,\u201d In re Brown, 376 B. R. 601, 607\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Tex. 2007)\u2014in order to deduct the $471\ncar-ownership expense and reduce his payment to credi\ntors by that amount. We do not see why Congress would\nhave preferred that result to the one that worries Ransom.\nThat is especially so because creditors may well be able to\nremedy Ransom\u2019s \u201cone payment left\u201d problem. If car\npayments cease during the life of the plan, just as if other\nfinancial circumstances change, an unsecured creditor\nmay move to modify the plan to increase the amount the\ndebtor must repay. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a71329(a)(1).\n   Ransom next contends that denying the ownership\nallowance to debtors in his position \u201csends entirely the\nwrong message, namely, that it is advantageous to be\ndeeply in debt on motor vehicle loans, rather than to pay\nthem off.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 55. But the choice here is\nnot between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers, as\nRansom would have it. Money is fungible: The $14,000\nthat Ransom spent to purchase his Camry outright was\nmoney he did not devote to paying down his credit card\ndebt, and Congress did not express a preference for one\nuse of these funds over the other. Further, Ransom\u2019s\nargument mistakes what the deductions in the means test\nare meant to accomplish. Rather than effecting any broad\nfederal policy as to saving or borrowing, the deductions\nserve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can\nafford essential items. The car-ownership allowance thus\nsafeguards a debtor\u2019s ability to retain a car throughout the\nplan period. If the debtor already owns a car outright, he\nhas no need for this protection.\n   Ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car\nfree and clear may need to replace it during the life of the\nplan; \u201c[g]ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle\n18          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat is owned outright,\u201d he states, \u201caccords best with\neconomic reality.\u201d Id., at 52. In essence, Ransom seeks an\nemergency cushion for car owners. But nothing in the\nstatute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors pre\nsumably would like in the event some unexpected need\narises. And a person who enters bankruptcy without any\ncar at all may also have to buy one during the plan period;\nyet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot\nclaim the ownership deduction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The\nappropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses\nlike a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a\ndeduction, but to use the method that the Code provides\nfor all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modifica\ntion of the plan in light of changed circumstances. See\n\u00a71329(a)(1); see also supra, at 17.\n                            IV\n   Based on BAPCPA\u2019s text, context, and purpose, we hold\nthat the Local Standard expense amount for transporta\ntion \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d is not \u201capplicable\u201d to a debtor who\nwill not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.\nBecause the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category covers only loan\nand lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free\nfrom any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allow\nance. In short, Ransom may not deduct loan or lease\nexpenses when he does not have any. We therefore affirm\nthe judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

I\nagree with the conclusion of the three other Courts of\nAppeals to address the question: that a debtor who owns a\ncar free and clear is entitled to the car-ownership allow\nance. See In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934 (CA8 2009); In re\nTate, 571 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2009); In re Ross-Tousey, 549 F.\n3d 1148 (CA7 2008).\n  The statutory text at issue is the phrase enacted in the\nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2005 (BAPCPA), \u201capplicable monthly expense\namounts specified under the National Standards and\nLocal Standards,\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The\nCourt holds that the word \u201capplicable\u201d in this provision\nimports into the Local Standards a directive in the Inter\nnal Revenue Service\u2019s Collection Financial Standards,\nwhich have as their stated purpose \u201cto help determine a\ntaxpayer\u2019s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability,\u201d App. to\nBrief for Respondent 1a. That directive says that \u201c[i]f a\ntaxpayer has no car payment,\u201d the Ownership Cost provi\nsions of the Local Standards will not apply. Id., at 3a.\n  That directive forms no part of the Local Standards to\nwhich the statute refers; and the fact that portions of the\nLocal Standards are to be disregarded for revenue\n2           RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncollection purposes says nothing about whether they are to\nbe disregarded for purposes of Chapter 13 of the Bank\nruptcy Code. The Court believes, however, that unless the\nIRS\u2019s Collection Financial Standards are imported into the\nLocal Standards, the word \u201capplicable\u201d would do no work,\nviolating the principle that \u201c \u2018we must give effect to every\nword of a statute wherever possible.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting\nLeocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004)). I disagree. The\ncanon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity.\nWhen a thought could have been expressed more con\ncisely, one does not always have to cast about for some\nadditional meaning to the word or phrase that could have\nbeen dispensed with. This has always been understood. A\nHouse of Lords opinion holds, for example, that in the\nphrase \u201c \u2018in addition to and not in derogation of \u2019 \u201d the last\npart adds nothing but emphasis. Davies v. Powell Duffryn\nAssociated Collieries, Ltd., [1942] A. C. 601, 607.\n   It seems to me that is the situation here. To be sure,\none can say \u201caccording to the attached table\u201d; but it is\nacceptable (and indeed I think more common) to say \u201cac\ncording to the applicable provisions of the attached table.\u201d\nThat seems to me the fairest reading of \u201capplicable\nmonthly expense amounts specified under the National\nStandards and Local Standards.\u201d That is especially so for\nthe Ownership Costs portion of the Local Standards,\nwhich had no column titled \u201cNo Car.\u201d Here the expense\namount would be that shown for one car (which is all the\ndebtor here owned) rather than that shown for two cars;\nand it would be no expense amount if the debtor owned no\ncar, since there is no \u201capplicable\u201d provision for that on the\ntable. For operating and public transportation costs, the\n\u201capplicable\u201d amount would similarly be the amount pro\nvided by the Local Standards for the geographic region in\nwhich the debtor resides. (The debtor would not first be\nrequired to prove that he actually operates the cars that\nhe owns, or, if does not own a car, that he actually uses\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npublic transportation.) The Court claims that the tables\n\u201care not self-defining,\u201d and that \u201c[s]ome amount of inter\npretation\u201d is necessary in choosing whether to claim a\ndeduction at all, for one car, or for two. Ante, at 14\u201315.\nBut this problem seems to me more metaphysical than\npractical. The point of the statutory language is to entitle\ndebtors who own cars to an ownership deduction, and I\nhave little doubt that debtors will be able to choose cor\nrectly whether to claim a deduction for one car or for two.\n  If the meaning attributed to the word by the Court were\nintended, it would have been most precise to say \u201cmonthly\nexpense amounts specified under the National Standards\nand Local Standards, if applicable for IRS collection pur\nposes.\u201d And even if utter precision was too much to ex\npect, it would at least have been more natural to say\n\u201cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National\nStandards and Local Standards, if applicable.\u201d That\nwould make it clear that amounts specified under those\nStandards may nonetheless not be applicable, justifying\n(perhaps) resort to some source other than the Standards\nthemselves to give meaning to the condition. The very\nnext paragraph of the Bankruptcy Code uses that formu\nlation (\u201cif applicable\u201d) to limit to actual expenses the\ndeduction for care of an elderly or chronically ill household\nmember: \u201c[T]he debtor\u2019s monthly expenses may include, if\napplicable, the continuation of actual expenses paid by the\ndebtor that are reasonable and necessary\u201d for that pur\npose. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added).\n  Elsewhere as well, the Code makes it very clear when\nprescribed deductions are limited to actual expenditures.\nSection 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) itself authorizes deductions for a\nhost of expenses\u2014health and disability insurance, for\nexample\u2014only to the extent that they are \u201cactual . . .\nexpenses\u201d that are \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Additional\ndeductions for energy are allowed, but again only if they\nare \u201cactual expenses\u201d that are \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d\n4             RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V). Given the clarity of those limitations\nto actual outlays, it seems strange for Congress to limit\nthe car-ownership deduction to the somewhat peculiar\ncategory \u201ccars subject to any amount whatever of out\nstanding indebtedness\u201d by the mere word \u201capplicable,\u201d\nmeant as incorporation of a limitation that appears in\ninstructions to IRS agents.*\n  I do not find the normal meaning of the text undermined\nby the fact that it produces a situation in which a\ndebtor who owes no payments on his car nonetheless gets\nthe operating-expense allowance. For the Court\u2019s more\nstrained interpretation still produces a situation in which\na debtor who owes only a single remaining payment on his\ncar gets the full allowance. As for the Court\u2019s imagined\nhorrible in which \u201ca debtor entering bankruptcy might\npurchase for a song a junkyard car,\u201d ante, at 17: That is\nfairly matched by the imagined horrible that, under the\nCourt\u2019s scheme, a debtor entering bankruptcy might pur\nchase a junkyard car for a song plus a $10 promissory note\npayable over several years. He would get the full owner\nship expense deduction.\n  Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation does not, as promised,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court protests that I misunderstand its use of the Collection\nFinancial Standards. Its opinion does not, it says, find them to be\nincorporated by the Bankruptcy Code; they simply \u201creinforc[e] our\nconclusion that . . . a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make\nsome loan or lease payments.\u201d Ante, at 10. True enough, the opinion\nsays that the Bankruptcy Code \u201cdoes not incorporate the IRS\u2019s guide\nlines,\u201d but it immediately continues that \u201ccourts may consult this\nmaterial in interpreting the National and Local Standards\u201d so long as it\nis not \u201cat odds with the statutory language.\u201d Ibid. In the present\ncontext, the real-world difference between finding the guidelines\nincorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me,\nsince I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant\nthem to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated. And\nwithout incorporation, they are at odds with the statutory language,\nwhich otherwise contains no hint that eligibility for a Car Ownership\ndeduction requires anything other than ownership of a car.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Nor do I think this difficulty\nis eliminated by the deus ex machina of 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a71329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an\nunsecured creditor to \u201cmove to modify the plan to increase\nthe amount the debtor must repay,\u201d ante, at 17. Apart\nfrom the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums in\nvolved would hardly make this worth the legal costs,\nallowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically\ncovered by the rigid means test would return us to \u201cthe\npre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median\nincome debtors\u2019 expenses,\u201d ante, at 16. If the BAPCPA\nhad thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would\nhave taken the much simpler and more logical step of\nproviding going in that the ownership expense allowance\nwould apply only so long as monthly payments were due.\n  The reality is, to describe it in the Court\u2019s own terms,\nthat occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, under\nallowance) \u201cis the inevitable result of a standardized\nformula like the means test . . . . Congress chose to toler\nate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test\nproduces.\u201d Ibid. Our job, it seems to me, is not to elimi\nnate or reduce those \u201coddit[ies],\u201d ibid., but to give the\nformula Congress adopted its fairest meaning.

Argued October 4, 2010\u2014Decided January 11, 2011\nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as\n the \u201cmeans test\u201d to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do\n pay them. The means test instructs a debtor to determine his \u201cdis\n posable income\u201d\u2014the amount he has available to reimburse credi\n tors\u2014by deducting from his current monthly income \u201camounts rea\n sonably necessary to be expended\u201d for, inter alia, \u201cmaintenance or\n support.\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i). For a debtor whose income is\n above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which ex\n penses qualify as \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d As\n relevant here, the statute provides that \u201c[t]he debtor\u2019s monthly ex\n penses shall be the debtor\u2019s applicable monthly expense amounts\n specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other\n Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for\n the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\n    The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for\n basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers\u2019\n ability to pay overdue taxes. The IRS also creates supplemental\n guidelines known as the \u201cCollection Financial Standards,\u201d which de\n scribe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them\n mean. The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation\n expenses, divided into vehicle \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d and vehicle \u201cOper\n ating Costs.\u201d The Collection Financial Standards explain that \u201cOwn\n ership Costs\u201d cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automo\n bile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car\n financing data. The Collection Financial Standards further state\n that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance\n2               RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for ownership costs.\n       When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he\n    listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor. Among his assets,\n    Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt. In determining\n    his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduc\n    tion of $471, the full amount specified in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table,\n    as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs. Based\n    on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan\n    that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unse\n    cured debt. FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct\n    all of Ransom\u2019s disposable income to unsecured creditors. FIA con\n    tended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership al\n    lowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.\n    Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.\n    The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld: A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take\n the car-ownership deduction. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) This Court\u2019s interpretation begins with the language of the\n Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only \u201cap\n plicable\u201d expense amounts listed in the Standards. Because the Code\n does not define the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d the term carries its ordi\n nary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit. What makes\n an expense amount \u201capplicable\u201d in this sense is most naturally un\n derstood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor\u2019s financial\n circumstances. Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to\n claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if\n that deduction is appropriate for him. And a deduction is so appro\n priate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the\n table during the life of the plan. Had Congress not wanted to sepa\n rate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it\n could have omitted the term \u201capplicable\u201d altogether. Without that\n word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each cate\n gory listed in the Standards. Interpreting the statute to require a\n threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that \u201capplicable\u201d\n carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.\n    This reading draws support from the statute\u2019s context and purpose.\n The Code initially defines a debtor\u2019s disposable income as his \u201ccur\n rent monthly income . . . less amounts reasonably necessary to be ex\n pended.\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2). It then instructs that such reasonably neces\n sary amounts \u201cshall be determined in accordance with\u201d the means\n test. \u00a71325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to ap\n proximate the debtor\u2019s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a\n debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incur\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  ring an expense in the relevant category. Further, the statute\u2019s pur\n  pose\u2014to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can af\n  ford\u2014is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with\n  the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\u2019s ability to afford repayment.\n  Pp. 6\u20139.\n     (b) The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car\n  loan or lease. The expense amount listed ($471) is the average\n  monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended\n  to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a\n  car. Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate \u201cOperat\n  ing Costs\u201d deduction. A person who owns a car free and clear is enti\n  tled to the \u201cOperating Costs\u201d deduction for all driving-related ex\n  penses. But such a person may not claim the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d\n  deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car\n  loan or lease. The IRS\u2019 Collection Financial Standards reinforce this\n  conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make\n  no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduc\n  tion. Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no ex\n  pense in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category, and that expense amount is\n  therefore not \u201capplicable\u201d to him.

A. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 11, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code enables an individ\nual to obtain a discharge of his debts if he pays his credi\ntors a portion of his monthly income in accordance with a\ncourt-approved plan. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71301 et seq. To deter\nmine how much income the debtor is capable of paying,\nChapter 13 uses a statutory formula known as the \u201cmeans\ntest.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. III), 1325(b)(3)(A)\n(2006 ed.). The means test instructs a debtor to deduct\nspecified expenses from his current monthly income. The\nresult is his \u201cdisposable income\u201d\u2014the amount he has\navailable to reimburse creditors. \u00a71325(b)(2).\n   This case concerns the specified expense for vehicle\nownership costs. We must determine whether a debtor\nlike petitioner Jason Ransom who owns his car outright,\nand so does not make loan or lease payments, may claim\nan allowance for car-ownership costs (thereby reducing the\namount he will repay creditors). We hold that the text,\ncontext, and purpose of the statutory provision at issue\npreclude this result. A debtor who does not make loan or\n2              RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N.

A. v. United States, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1). In particular, Congress\nadopted the means test\u2014\u201c[t]he heart of [BAPCPA\u2019s] con\nsumer bankruptcy reforms,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u201331, pt. 1,\np. 2 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), and the home of the\nstatutory language at issue here\u2014to help ensure that\ndebtors who can pay creditors do pay them. See, e.g., ibid.\n(under BAPCPA, \u201cdebtors [will] repay creditors the maxi\nmum they can afford\u201d).\n   In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a\nformula to calculate a debtor\u2019s disposable income, which\nthe debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a\ncourt-approved plan generally lasting from three to five\nyears. \u00a7\u00a71325(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4).1 The statute defines\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d less\n\u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d for \u201cmain\ntenance or support,\u201d business expenditures, and certain\ncharitable contributions. \u00a7\u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). For a\ndebtor whose income is above the median for his State, the\nmeans test identifies which expenses qualify as \u201camounts\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Chapter 13 borrows the means test from Chapter 7, where it is used\n\nas a screening mechanism to determine whether a Chapter 7 proceed\ning is appropriate. Individuals who file for bankruptcy relief under\nChapter 7 liquidate their nonexempt assets, rather than dedicate their\nfuture income, to repay creditors. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726. If\nthe debtor\u2019s Chapter 7 petition discloses that his disposable income as\ncalculated by the means test exceeds a certain threshold, the petition is\npresumptively abusive. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i). If the debtor cannot rebut the\npresumption, the court may dismiss the case or, with the debtor\u2019s\nconsent, convert it into a Chapter 13 proceeding. \u00a7707(b)(1).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

See, e.g., In re\nSlusher, 359 B. R. 290, 294 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 2007).\n  Under the means test, a debtor calculating his \u201crea\nsonably necessary\u201d expenses is directed to claim allow\nances for defined living expenses, as well as for secured\nand priority debt. \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(iv). As relevant\nhere, the statute provides:\n       \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s\n     applicable monthly expense amounts specified under\n     the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n     debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories\n     specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the\n     Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which\n     the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\nThese are the principal amounts that the debtor can claim\nas his reasonable living expenses and thereby shield from\ncreditors.\n  The National and Local Standards referenced in this\nprovision are tables that the IRS prepares listing stan\ndardized expense amounts for basic necessities.2 The IRS\nuses the Standards to help calculate taxpayers\u2019 ability to\npay overdue taxes. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a77122(d)(2). The IRS\nalso prepares supplemental guidelines known as the Col\nlection Financial Standards, which describe how to use the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The National Standards designate allowances for six categories of\n\nexpenses: (1) food; (2) housekeeping supplies; (3) apparel and services;\n(4) personal care products and services; (5) out-of-pocket health care\ncosts; and (6) miscellaneous expenses.

The\nCollection Financial Standards further instruct that, in\nthe tax-collection context, \u201c[i]f a taxpayer has no car pay\nment, . . . only the operating costs portion of the transpor\ntation standard is used to come up with the allowable\ntransportation expense.\u201d Ibid.\n                           B\n  Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in July\n2006. App. 1, 54. Among his liabilities, Ransom itemized\nover $82,500 in unsecured debt, including a claim held by\nrespondent FIA Card Services, N. A. (FIA). Id., at 41.\nAmong his assets, Ransom listed a 2004 Toyota Camry,\nvalued at $14,000, which he owns free of any debt. Id., at\n38, 49, 52.\n  For purposes of the means test, Ransom reported in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Although\n             both components of the transportation allowance are listed\nin the Local Standards, only the operating-cost expense amounts vary\nby geography; in contrast, the IRS provides a nationwide figure for\nownership costs.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

In de\ntermining those expenses, Ransom claimed a car\nownership deduction of $471 for the Camry, the full\namount specified in the IRS\u2019s \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table.\nId., at 49. Ransom listed a separate deduction of $338 for\ncar-operating costs. Ibid. Based on these figures, Ransom\nhad disposable income of $210.55 per month. Id., at 53.\n  Ransom proposed a 5-year plan that would result in\nrepayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt.\nId., at 55. FIA objected to confirmation of the plan on the\nground that it did not direct all of Ransom\u2019s disposable\nincome to unsecured creditors. Id., at 64. In particular,\nFIA argued that Ransom should not have claimed the car\nownership allowance because he does not make loan or\nlease payments on his car. Id., at 67. FIA noted that\nwithout this allowance, Ransom\u2019s disposable income would\nbe $681.55\u2014the $210.55 he reported plus the $471 he\ndeducted for vehicle ownership. Id., at 71. The difference\nover the 60 months of the plan amounts to about $28,000.\n                              C\n   The Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of Ransom\u2019s\nplan.

In re Ransom, 380 B. R.\n799, 808\u2013809 (2007). The panel reasoned that an \u201cexpense\n[amount] becomes relevant to the debtor (i.e., appropriate\nor applicable to the debtor) when he or she in fact has such\nan expense.\u201d Id., at 807. \u201c[W]hat is important,\u201d the panel\nnoted, \u201cis the payments that debtors actually make, not\nhow many cars they own, because [those] payments . . .\nare what actually affect their ability to\u201d reimburse unse\n6             RANSOM v.

In re Ransom, 577 F. 3d 1026, 1027 (2009).\nThe plain language of the statute, the court held, \u201cdoes not\nallow a debtor to deduct an \u2018ownership cost\u2019 . . . that the\ndebtor does not have.\u201d Id., at 1030. The court observed\nthat \u201c[a]n \u2018ownership cost\u2019 is not an \u2018expense\u2019\u2014either\nactual or applicable\u2014if it does not exist, period.\u201d Ibid.\n  We granted a writ of certiorari to resolve a split of au\nthority over whether a debtor who does not make loan or\nlease payments on his car may claim the deduction for\nvehicle-ownership costs. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).4 We now\naffirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                             II\n  Our interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts\n\u201cwhere all such inquiries must begin: with the language of\nthe statute itself.\u201d United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,\nInc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989). As noted, the provision of\nthe Code central to the decision of this case states:\n       \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s\n     applicable monthly expense amounts specified under\n     the National Standards and Local Standards, and the\n     debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories\n     specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the\n     [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d\n     \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).\nThe key word in this provision is \u201capplicable\u201d: A debtor\nmay claim not all, but only \u201capplicable\u201d expense amounts\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Compare In re Ransom, 577 F. 3d 1026, 1027 (CA9 2009) (case be\n\nlow), with In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934, 935 (CA8 2009) (permitting\nthe allowance), In re Tate, 571 F. 3d 423, 424 (CA5 2009) (same), and\nIn re Ross-Tousey, 549 F. 3d 1148, 1162 (CA7 2008) (same). The ques\ntion has also divided bankruptcy courts. See, e.g., In re Canales, 377\nB. R. 658, 662 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2007) (citing dozens of cases reach\ning opposing results).\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlisted in the Standards. Whether Ransom may claim the\n$471 car-ownership deduction accordingly turns on\nwhether that expense amount is \u201capplicable\u201d to him.\n   Because the Code does not define \u201capplicable,\u201d we look\nto the ordinary meaning of the term. See, e.g., Hamilton\nv. Lanning, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6). \u201cAp\nplicable\u201d means \u201ccapable of being applied: having rele\nvance\u201d or \u201cfit, suitable, or right to be applied: appropriate.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 105 (2002).\nSee also New Oxford American Dictionary 74 (2d ed. 2005)\n(\u201crelevant or appropriate\u201d); 1 Oxford English Dictionary\n575 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[c]apable of being applied\u201d or \u201c[f]it or\nsuitable for its purpose, appropriate\u201d). So an expense\namount is \u201capplicable\u201d within the plain meaning of the\nstatute when it is appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.\n   What makes an expense amount \u201capplicable\u201d in this\nsense (appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit) is most natu\nrally understood to be its correspondence to an individual\ndebtor\u2019s financial circumstances. Rather than authorizing\nall debtors to take deductions in all listed categories,\nCongress established a filter: A debtor may claim a deduc\ntion from a National or Local Standard table (like \u201c[Car]\nOwnership Costs\u201d) if but only if that deduction is appro\npriate for him. And a deduction is so appropriate only if\nthe debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered\nby the table\u2014that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind\nof expense during the life of the plan. The statute under\nscores the necessity of making such an individualized\ndetermination by referring to \u201cthe debtor\u2019s applicable\nmonthly expense amounts,\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis\nadded)\u2014in other words, the expense amounts applicable\n(appropriate, etc.) to each particular debtor. Identifying\nthese amounts requires looking at the financial situation\nof the debtor and asking whether a National or Local\nStandard table is relevant to him.\n   If Congress had not wanted to separate in this way\n8             RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndebtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do\nnot, it could have omitted the term \u201capplicable\u201d altogether.\nWithout that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a\ndeduction for each category listed in the Standards. Con\ngress presumably included \u201capplicable\u201d to achieve a differ\nent result. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004)\n(\u201c[W]e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever\npossible\u201d). Interpreting the statute to require a threshold\ndetermination of eligibility ensures that the term \u201cappli\ncable\u201d carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.\n   This reading of \u201capplicable\u201d also draws support from the\nstatutory context. The Code initially defines a debtor\u2019s\ndisposable income as his \u201ccurrent monthly income . . . less\namounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2)\n(emphasis added).       The statute then instructs that\n\u201c[a]mounts reasonably necessary to be expended . . . shall\nbe determined in accordance with\u201d the means test.\n\u00a71325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to\napproximate the debtor\u2019s reasonable expenditures on\nessential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for\na deduction by actually incurring an expense in the rele\nvant category. If a debtor will not have a particular kind\nof expense during his plan, an allowance to cover that cost\nis not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the\nstatute.5\n   Finally, consideration of BAPCPA\u2019s purpose strengthens\nour reading of the term \u201capplicable.\u201d Congress designed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This interpretation also avoids the anomalous result of granting\n\npreferential treatment to individuals with above-median income.\nBecause the means test does not apply to Chapter 13 debtors whose\nincomes are below the median, those debtors must prove on a case-by\ncase basis that each claimed expense is reasonably necessary. See\n\u00a7\u00a71325(b)(2) and (3). If a below-median-income debtor cannot take a\ndeduction for a nonexistent expense, we doubt Congress meant to\nprovide such an allowance to an above-median-income debtor\u2014the very\nkind of debtor whose perceived abuse of the bankruptcy system in\nspired Congress to enact the means test.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

R. Rep., at 2. This purpose\nis best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent\nwith the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\u2019s ability to\nafford repayment. Cf. Hamilton, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14) (rejecting an interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code\nthat \u201cwould produce [the] senseless resul[t]\u201d of \u201cdeny[ing]\ncreditors payments that the debtor could easily make\u201d).\nRequiring a debtor to incur the kind of expenses for which\nhe claims a means-test deduction thus advances\nBAPCPA\u2019s objectives.\n    Because we conclude that a person cannot claim an\nallowance for vehicle-ownership costs unless he has some\nexpense falling within that category, the question in this\ncase becomes: What expenses does the vehicle-ownership\ncategory cover? If it covers loan and lease payments alone,\nRansom does not qualify, because he has no such expense.\nOnly if that category also covers other costs associ\nated with having a car would Ransom be entitled to this\ndeduction.\n    The less inclusive understanding is the right one: The\nownership category encompasses the costs of a car loan or\nlease and nothing more.

In other words, the sum $471 is\nthe average monthly payment for loans and leases na\ntionwide; it is not intended to estimate other conceivable\nexpenses associated with maintaining a car.

App. to Brief for Respon\ndent 3a; see supra, at 4. Although the statute does not\nincorporate the IRS\u2019s guidelines, courts may consult this\nmaterial in interpreting the National and Local Stan\ndards; after all, the IRS uses those tables for a similar\npurpose\u2014to determine how much money a delinquent\ntaxpayer can afford to pay the Government. The guide\nlines of course cannot control if they are at odds with the\nstatutory language. But here, the Collection Financial\nStandards\u2019 treatment of the car-ownership deduction\nreinforces our conclusion that, under the statute, a debtor\nseeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or\nlease payments.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 In addition, the IRS has categorized taxes, including those associ\n\nated with car ownership, as an \u201cOther Necessary Expens[e],\u201d for which\na debtor may take a deduction.

Accordingly, the\ncar-ownership expense amount is not \u201capplicable\u201d to him,\nand the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction.\n                             III\n  Ransom\u2019s argument to the contrary relies on a different\ninterpretation of the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d an objection to\nour view of the scope of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category,\nand a criticism of the policy implications of our approach.\nWe do not think these claims persuasive.\n                              A\n   Ransom first offers another understanding of the term\n\u201capplicable.\u201d A debtor, he says, determines his \u201capplica\nble\u201d deductions by locating the box in each National or\nLocal Standard table that corresponds to his geographic\nlocation, income, family size, or number of cars. Under\nthis approach, a debtor \u201cconsult[s] the table[s] alone\u201d to\ndetermine his appropriate expense amounts. Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues\nthat his \u201capplicable\u201d allowance is the sum listed in the\nfirst column of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table ($471); if he\nhad a second vehicle, the amount in the second column\n($332) would also be \u201capplicable.\u201d On this approach, the\nword \u201capplicable\u201d serves a function wholly internal to the\ntables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduc\ntion is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndoes not \u201cincorporat[e]\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpor[t]\u201d the IRS\u2019s guidance.\nPost, at 1, 4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The dissent questions what possible\nbasis except incorporation could justify our consulting the IRS\u2019s view,\npost, at 4, n., but we think that basis obvious: The IRS creates the\nNational and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them\nas it deems necessary, and uses them every day. The agency might,\ntherefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not control\nling) to say about them.\n12          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndebtor to the correct box (and associated dollar amount of\ndeduction) within every table.\n   This alternative reading of \u201capplicable\u201d fails to comport\nwith the statute\u2019s text, context, or purpose. As intimated\nearlier, supra, at 7\u20138, Ransom\u2019s interpretation would\nrender the term \u201capplicable\u201d superfluous. Assume Con\ngress had omitted that word and simply authorized a\ndeduction of \u201cthe debtor\u2019s monthly expense amounts\u201d\nspecified in the Standards. That language, most naturally\nread, would direct each debtor to locate the box in every\ntable corresponding to his location, income, family size, or\nnumber of cars and to deduct the amount stated. In other\nwords, the language would instruct the debtor to use the\nexact approach Ransom urges. The word \u201capplicable\u201d is\nnot necessary to accomplish that result; it is necessary\nonly for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to\nmake use of the tables from those who are not. Further,\nRansom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d would sever the connec\ntion between the means test and the statutory provision it\nis meant to implement\u2014the authorization of an allowance\nfor (but only for) \u201creasonably necessary\u201d expenses. Ex\npenses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of\nas reasonably necessary. And finally, Ransom\u2019s interpre\ntation would run counter to the statute\u2019s overall purpose of\nensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they\ncan\u2014here, by shielding some $28,000 that he does not in\nfact need for loan or lease payments.\n   As against all this, Ransom argues that his reading\nis necessary to account for the means test\u2019s distinction\nbetween \u201capplicable\u201d and \u201cactual\u201d expenses\u2014more fully\nstated, between the phrase \u201capplicable monthly expense\namounts\u201d specified in the Standards and the phrase \u201cac\ntual monthly expenses for . . . Other Necessary Expenses.\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added). The latter phrase\nenables a debtor to deduct his actual expenses in particu\nlar categories that the IRS designates relating mainly to\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Internal Revenue Manual\n\u00a75.15.1.10(1), http://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/ irm_05-015\n001.html#d0e1381. According to Ransom, \u201capplicable\u201d\ncannot mean the same thing as \u201cactual.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 40. He thus concludes that \u201can \u2018applicable\u2019 expense\ncan be claimed [under the means test] even if no \u2018actual\u2019\nexpense was incurred.\u201d Ibid.\n   Our interpretation of the statute, however, equally\navoids conflating \u201capplicable\u201d with \u201cactual\u201d costs. Al\nthough the expense amounts in the Standards apply only\nif the debtor incurs the relevant expense, the debtor\u2019s out\nof-pocket cost may well not control the amount of the\ndeduction. If a debtor\u2019s actual expenses exceed the\namounts listed in the tables, for example, the debtor may\nclaim an allowance only for the specified sum, rather than\nfor his real expenditures.8 For the Other Necessary Ex\npense categories, by contrast, the debtor may deduct his\nactual expenses, no matter how high they are.9 Our read\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The parties and the Solicitor General as amicus curiae dispute the\n\nproper deduction for a debtor who has expenses that are lower than the\namounts listed in the Local Standards. Ransom argues that a debtor\nmay claim the specified expense amount in full regardless of his out-of\npocket costs. Brief for Petitioner 24\u201327. The Government concurs with\nthis view, provided (as we require) that a debtor has some expense\nrelating to the deduction. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19\u201321. FIA, relying on the IRS\u2019s practice, contends to the contrary that\na debtor may claim only his actual expenditures in this circumstance.\nBrief for Respondent 12, 45\u201346 (arguing that the Local Standards\nfunction as caps). We decline to resolve this issue. Because Ransom\nincurs no ownership expense at all, the car-ownership allowance is not\napplicable to him in the first instance. Ransom is therefore not entitled\nto a deduction under either approach.\n  9 For the same reason, the allowance for \u201capplicable monthly expense\n\namounts\u201d at issue here differs from the additional allowances that the\ndissent cites for the deduction of actual expenditures. See post, at 3\u20134\n(noting allowances for \u201cactual expenses\u201d for care of an elderly or chroni\ncally ill household member, \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II), and for home energy\ncosts, \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V)).\n14            RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning of the means test thus gives full effect to \u201cthe distinc\ntion between \u2018applicable\u2019 and \u2018actual\u2019 without taking a\nfurther step to conclude that \u2018applicable\u2019 means \u2018nonexis\ntent.\u2019 \u201d In re Ross-Tousey, 368 B. R. 762, 765 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nED Wis. 2007), rev\u2019d, 549 F. 3d 1148 (CA7 2008).\n   Finally, Ransom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d may not even\nanswer the essential question: whether a debtor may\nclaim a deduction. \u201c[C]onsult[ing] the table[s] alone\u201d to\ndetermine a debtor\u2019s deduction, as Ransom urges us to do,\nReply Brief for Petitioner 16, often will not be sufficient\nbecause the tables are not self-defining. This case pro\nvides a prime example. The \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table\nfeatures two columns labeled \u201cFirst Car\u201d and \u201cSecond\nCar.\u201d See supra, at 4. Standing alone, the table does not\nspecify whether it refers to the first and second cars owned\n(as Ransom avers), or the first and second cars for which\nthe debtor incurs ownership costs (as FIA maintains)\u2014and\nso the table does not resolve the issue in dispute.10 See\nIn re Kimbro, 389 B. R. 518, 533 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6\n2008) (Fulton, J., dissenting) (\u201c[O]ne cannot really \u2018just\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The interpretive problem is not, as the dissent suggests, \u201cwhether\nto claim a deduction for one car or for two,\u201d post, at 3, but rather\nwhether to claim a deduction for any car that is owned if the debtor has\nno ownership costs. Indeed, if we had to decide this question on the\nbasis of the table alone, we might well decide that a debtor who does\nnot make loan or lease payments cannot claim an allowance. The table,\nafter all, is titled \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d\u2014suggesting that it applies to\nthose debtors who incur such costs. And as noted earlier, the dollar\namounts in the table represent average automobile loan and lease\npayments nationwide (with all other car-related expenses approxi\nmated in the separate \u201cOperating Costs\u201d table). See supra, at 9\u201310.\nRansom himself concedes that not every debtor falls within the terms of\nthis table; he would exclude, and thus prohibit from taking a deduction,\na person who does not own a car. Brief for Petitioner 33. In like\nmanner, the four corners of the table appear to exclude an additional\ngroup\u2014debtors like Ransom who own their cars free and clear and so\ndo not make the loan or lease payments that constitute \u201cOwnership\nCosts.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlook up\u2019 dollar amounts in the tables without either refer\nring to IRS guidelines for using the tables or imposing pre\nexisting assumptions about how [they] are to be navi\ngated\u201d (footnote omitted)). Some amount of interpretation\nis necessary to decide what the deduction is for and\nwhether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought\nback full circle to our prior analysis.\n                               B\n  Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership\ndeduction as covering no more than loan and lease pay\nments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the\nmeans test that provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the\ndebtor shall not include any payments for debts.\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The car-ownership deduction cannot\ncomprise only loan and lease payments, Ransom contends,\nbecause those payments are always debts. See Brief for\nPetitioner 28, 44\u201345.\n  Ransom ignores that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence\ngoverns the full panoply of deductions under the National\nand Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense\ncategories. We hesitate to rely on that general provision\nto interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction\nbecause Congress did not draft the former with the latter\nspecially in mind; any friction between the two likely\nreflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board\nexclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particu\nlar IRS allowance.11 Further, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sen\ntence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to\nauthorize, deductions. It cannot establish an allowance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Because Ransom does not make payments on his car, we need not\n\nand do not resolve how the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence affects the\nvehicle-ownership deduction when a debtor has a loan or lease expense.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n. 5 (offering alterna\ntive views on this question); Tr. of Oral Arg. 51\u201352.\n16          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor non-loan or -lease ownership costs that no National or\nLocal Standard covers. Accordingly, the \u201cnotwithstand\ning\u201d sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the\n\u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table does not apply to a debtor whose\ncar is not encumbered.\n                              C\n  Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test\nis necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by\nCongress. At the outset, we note that the policy concerns\nRansom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates:\nHis interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate\nBAPCPA\u2019s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote\ntheir full disposable income to repaying creditors. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139. We nonetheless address each of Ransom\u2019s\npolicy arguments in turn.\n  Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our\ninterpretation, \u201c[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing\nto take place while they still have a few car payments left,\nthus retaining an ownership deduction which they would\nlose if they filed just after making their last payment.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 54. Indeed, a debtor with only a single\ncar payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim\na monthly ownership deduction. Id., at 15, 52.\n  But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a stan\ndardized formula like the means test, even more under\nRansom\u2019s reading than under ours. Such formulas are by\ntheir nature over- and under-inclusive. In eliminating the\npre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median\nincome debtors\u2019 expenses, on the ground that it leant itself\nto abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculi\narity that a brighter-line test produces. And Ransom\u2019s\nalternative reading of the statute would spawn its own\nanomalies\u2014even placing to one side the fundamental\nstrangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or\nlease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts. On Ransom\u2019s view, for example, a debtor entering\nbankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car\u2014\u201can\nold, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would] si[t] on cinder\nblocks in his backyard,\u201d In re Brown, 376 B. R. 601, 607\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Tex. 2007)\u2014in order to deduct the $471\ncar-ownership expense and reduce his payment to credi\ntors by that amount. We do not see why Congress would\nhave preferred that result to the one that worries Ransom.\nThat is especially so because creditors may well be able to\nremedy Ransom\u2019s \u201cone payment left\u201d problem. If car\npayments cease during the life of the plan, just as if other\nfinancial circumstances change, an unsecured creditor\nmay move to modify the plan to increase the amount the\ndebtor must repay. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a71329(a)(1).\n   Ransom next contends that denying the ownership\nallowance to debtors in his position \u201csends entirely the\nwrong message, namely, that it is advantageous to be\ndeeply in debt on motor vehicle loans, rather than to pay\nthem off.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 55. But the choice here is\nnot between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers, as\nRansom would have it. Money is fungible: The $14,000\nthat Ransom spent to purchase his Camry outright was\nmoney he did not devote to paying down his credit card\ndebt, and Congress did not express a preference for one\nuse of these funds over the other. Further, Ransom\u2019s\nargument mistakes what the deductions in the means test\nare meant to accomplish. Rather than effecting any broad\nfederal policy as to saving or borrowing, the deductions\nserve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can\nafford essential items. The car-ownership allowance thus\nsafeguards a debtor\u2019s ability to retain a car throughout the\nplan period. If the debtor already owns a car outright, he\nhas no need for this protection.\n   Ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car\nfree and clear may need to replace it during the life of the\nplan; \u201c[g]ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle\n18          RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat is owned outright,\u201d he states, \u201caccords best with\neconomic reality.\u201d Id., at 52. In essence, Ransom seeks an\nemergency cushion for car owners. But nothing in the\nstatute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors pre\nsumably would like in the event some unexpected need\narises. And a person who enters bankruptcy without any\ncar at all may also have to buy one during the plan period;\nyet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot\nclaim the ownership deduction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The\nappropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses\nlike a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a\ndeduction, but to use the method that the Code provides\nfor all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modifica\ntion of the plan in light of changed circumstances. See\n\u00a71329(a)(1); see also supra, at 17.\n                            IV\n   Based on BAPCPA\u2019s text, context, and purpose, we hold\nthat the Local Standard expense amount for transporta\ntion \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d is not \u201capplicable\u201d to a debtor who\nwill not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.\nBecause the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category covers only loan\nand lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free\nfrom any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allow\nance. In short, Ransom may not deduct loan or lease\nexpenses when he does not have any. We therefore affirm\nthe judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

I\nagree with the conclusion of the three other Courts of\nAppeals to address the question: that a debtor who owns a\ncar free and clear is entitled to the car-ownership allow\nance. See In re Washburn, 579 F. 3d 934 (CA8 2009); In re\nTate, 571 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2009); In re Ross-Tousey, 549 F.\n3d 1148 (CA7 2008).\n  The statutory text at issue is the phrase enacted in the\nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2005 (BAPCPA), \u201capplicable monthly expense\namounts specified under the National Standards and\nLocal Standards,\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The\nCourt holds that the word \u201capplicable\u201d in this provision\nimports into the Local Standards a directive in the Inter\nnal Revenue Service\u2019s Collection Financial Standards,\nwhich have as their stated purpose \u201cto help determine a\ntaxpayer\u2019s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability,\u201d App. to\nBrief for Respondent 1a. That directive says that \u201c[i]f a\ntaxpayer has no car payment,\u201d the Ownership Cost provi\nsions of the Local Standards will not apply. Id., at 3a.\n  That directive forms no part of the Local Standards to\nwhich the statute refers; and the fact that portions of the\nLocal Standards are to be disregarded for revenue\n2           RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncollection purposes says nothing about whether they are to\nbe disregarded for purposes of Chapter 13 of the Bank\nruptcy Code. The Court believes, however, that unless the\nIRS\u2019s Collection Financial Standards are imported into the\nLocal Standards, the word \u201capplicable\u201d would do no work,\nviolating the principle that \u201c \u2018we must give effect to every\nword of a statute wherever possible.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting\nLeocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004)). I disagree. The\ncanon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity.\nWhen a thought could have been expressed more con\ncisely, one does not always have to cast about for some\nadditional meaning to the word or phrase that could have\nbeen dispensed with. This has always been understood. A\nHouse of Lords opinion holds, for example, that in the\nphrase \u201c \u2018in addition to and not in derogation of \u2019 \u201d the last\npart adds nothing but emphasis. Davies v. Powell Duffryn\nAssociated Collieries, Ltd., [1942] A. C. 601, 607.\n   It seems to me that is the situation here. To be sure,\none can say \u201caccording to the attached table\u201d; but it is\nacceptable (and indeed I think more common) to say \u201cac\ncording to the applicable provisions of the attached table.\u201d\nThat seems to me the fairest reading of \u201capplicable\nmonthly expense amounts specified under the National\nStandards and Local Standards.\u201d That is especially so for\nthe Ownership Costs portion of the Local Standards,\nwhich had no column titled \u201cNo Car.\u201d Here the expense\namount would be that shown for one car (which is all the\ndebtor here owned) rather than that shown for two cars;\nand it would be no expense amount if the debtor owned no\ncar, since there is no \u201capplicable\u201d provision for that on the\ntable. For operating and public transportation costs, the\n\u201capplicable\u201d amount would similarly be the amount pro\nvided by the Local Standards for the geographic region in\nwhich the debtor resides. (The debtor would not first be\nrequired to prove that he actually operates the cars that\nhe owns, or, if does not own a car, that he actually uses\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npublic transportation.) The Court claims that the tables\n\u201care not self-defining,\u201d and that \u201c[s]ome amount of inter\npretation\u201d is necessary in choosing whether to claim a\ndeduction at all, for one car, or for two. Ante, at 14\u201315.\nBut this problem seems to me more metaphysical than\npractical. The point of the statutory language is to entitle\ndebtors who own cars to an ownership deduction, and I\nhave little doubt that debtors will be able to choose cor\nrectly whether to claim a deduction for one car or for two.\n  If the meaning attributed to the word by the Court were\nintended, it would have been most precise to say \u201cmonthly\nexpense amounts specified under the National Standards\nand Local Standards, if applicable for IRS collection pur\nposes.\u201d And even if utter precision was too much to ex\npect, it would at least have been more natural to say\n\u201cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National\nStandards and Local Standards, if applicable.\u201d That\nwould make it clear that amounts specified under those\nStandards may nonetheless not be applicable, justifying\n(perhaps) resort to some source other than the Standards\nthemselves to give meaning to the condition. The very\nnext paragraph of the Bankruptcy Code uses that formu\nlation (\u201cif applicable\u201d) to limit to actual expenses the\ndeduction for care of an elderly or chronically ill household\nmember: \u201c[T]he debtor\u2019s monthly expenses may include, if\napplicable, the continuation of actual expenses paid by the\ndebtor that are reasonable and necessary\u201d for that pur\npose. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added).\n  Elsewhere as well, the Code makes it very clear when\nprescribed deductions are limited to actual expenditures.\nSection 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) itself authorizes deductions for a\nhost of expenses\u2014health and disability insurance, for\nexample\u2014only to the extent that they are \u201cactual . . .\nexpenses\u201d that are \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Additional\ndeductions for energy are allowed, but again only if they\nare \u201cactual expenses\u201d that are \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d\n4             RANSOM v. FIA CARD SERVICES, N. A.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V). Given the clarity of those limitations\nto actual outlays, it seems strange for Congress to limit\nthe car-ownership deduction to the somewhat peculiar\ncategory \u201ccars subject to any amount whatever of out\nstanding indebtedness\u201d by the mere word \u201capplicable,\u201d\nmeant as incorporation of a limitation that appears in\ninstructions to IRS agents.*\n  I do not find the normal meaning of the text undermined\nby the fact that it produces a situation in which a\ndebtor who owes no payments on his car nonetheless gets\nthe operating-expense allowance. For the Court\u2019s more\nstrained interpretation still produces a situation in which\na debtor who owes only a single remaining payment on his\ncar gets the full allowance. As for the Court\u2019s imagined\nhorrible in which \u201ca debtor entering bankruptcy might\npurchase for a song a junkyard car,\u201d ante, at 17: That is\nfairly matched by the imagined horrible that, under the\nCourt\u2019s scheme, a debtor entering bankruptcy might pur\nchase a junkyard car for a song plus a $10 promissory note\npayable over several years. He would get the full owner\nship expense deduction.\n  Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation does not, as promised,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court protests that I misunderstand its use of the Collection\nFinancial Standards. Its opinion does not, it says, find them to be\nincorporated by the Bankruptcy Code; they simply \u201creinforc[e] our\nconclusion that . . . a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make\nsome loan or lease payments.\u201d Ante, at 10. True enough, the opinion\nsays that the Bankruptcy Code \u201cdoes not incorporate the IRS\u2019s guide\nlines,\u201d but it immediately continues that \u201ccourts may consult this\nmaterial in interpreting the National and Local Standards\u201d so long as it\nis not \u201cat odds with the statutory language.\u201d Ibid. In the present\ncontext, the real-world difference between finding the guidelines\nincorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me,\nsince I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant\nthem to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated. And\nwithout incorporation, they are at odds with the statutory language,\nwhich otherwise contains no hint that eligibility for a Car Ownership\ndeduction requires anything other than ownership of a car.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmaintain \u201cthe connection between the means test and the\nstatutory provision it is meant to implement\u2014the authori\nzation of an allowance for (but only for) \u2018reasonably neces\nsary\u2019 expenses,\u201d ante, at 12. Nor do I think this difficulty\nis eliminated by the deus ex machina of 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a71329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an\nunsecured creditor to \u201cmove to modify the plan to increase\nthe amount the debtor must repay,\u201d ante, at 17. Apart\nfrom the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums in\nvolved would hardly make this worth the legal costs,\nallowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically\ncovered by the rigid means test would return us to \u201cthe\npre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median\nincome debtors\u2019 expenses,\u201d ante, at 16. If the BAPCPA\nhad thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would\nhave taken the much simpler and more logical step of\nproviding going in that the ownership expense allowance\nwould apply only so long as monthly payments were due.\n  The reality is, to describe it in the Court\u2019s own terms,\nthat occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, under\nallowance) \u201cis the inevitable result of a standardized\nformula like the means test . . . . Congress chose to toler\nate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test\nproduces.\u201d Ibid. Our job, it seems to me, is not to elimi\nnate or reduce those \u201coddit[ies],\u201d ibid., but to give the\nformula Congress adopted its fairest meaning. In my\njudgment the \u201capplicable monthly expense amounts\u201d for\noperating costs \u201cspecified under the . . . Local Standards,\u201d\nare the amounts specified in those Standards for either\none car or two cars, whichever of those is applicable.\n</pre>",
