UNITED STATES\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09\u2013837.      Argued November 8, 2010\u2014Decided January 11, 2011\nPetitioners (hereinafter Mayo) offer residency programs to doctors who\n  have graduated from medical school and seek additional instruction\n  in a chosen specialty. Those programs train doctors primarily\n  through hands-on experience. Although residents are required to\n  take part in formal educational activities, these doctors generally\n  spend the bulk of their time\u2014typically 50 to 80 hours a week\u2014caring\n  for patients. Mayo pays its residents annual \u201cstipends\u201d of over\n  $40,000 and also provides them with health insurance, malpractice\n  insurance, and paid vacation time.\n     The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) requires employ\n  ees and employers to pay taxes on all \u201cwages\u201d employees receive, 26\n  U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73101(a), 3111(a), and defines \u201cwages\u201d to include \u201call remu\n  neration for employment,\u201d \u00a73121(a). FICA defines \u201cemployment\u201d as\n  \u201cany service . . . performed . . . by an employee for the person employ\n  ing him,\u201d \u00a73121(b), but excludes from taxation any \u201cservice performed\n  in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university . . . if such service\n  is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending\n  classes at [the school],\u201d \u00a73121(b)(10). Since 1951, the Treasury De\n  partment has construed the student exception to exempt from taxa\n  tion students who work for their schools \u201cas an incident to and for the\n  purpose of pursuing a course of study.\u201d 16 Fed. Reg. 12474. In 2004,\n  the Department issued regulations providing that \u201c[t]he services of a\n  full-time employee\u201d\u2014which includes an employee normally scheduled\n  to work 40 hours or more per week\u2014\u201care not incident to and for the\n  purpose of pursuing a course of study.\u201d 26 CFR \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u2013\n  2(d)(3)(iii). The Department explained that this analysis \u201cis not af\n  fected by the fact that the services . . . may have an educational, in\n2    MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                     UNITED STATES\n                        Syllabus\n\n    structional, or training aspect.\u201d Ibid. The rule offers as an example a\n    medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform ser\n    vices 40 or more hours per week, and concludes that the resident is\n    not a student.\n       Mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid, and the Dis\n    trict Court agreed. It found the full-time employee rule inconsistent\n    with \u00a73121\u2019s unambiguous text and concluded that the factors gov\n    erning this Court\u2019s analysis in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v.\n    United States, 440 U. S. 472, also indicated that the rule was invalid.\n    The Eighth Circuit reversed. Applying Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\n    ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, the Court of Ap\n    peals concluded that the Department\u2019s regulation was a permissible\n    interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\nHeld: The Treasury Department\u2019s full-time employee rule is a reason\n able construction of \u00a73121(b)(10). Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) Under Chevron\u2019s two-part framework, the Court first asks\n whether Congress has \u201cdirectly addressed the precise question at is\n sue.\u201d 467 U. S., at 842-843. Congress has not done so here; the stat\n ute does not define \u201cstudent\u201d or otherwise attend to the question\n whether medical residents are subject to FICA. Pp. 6\u20137.\n    (b) The parties debate whether the Court should next apply Chev\n ron step two or the multi-factor analysis used to review a tax regula\n tion in National Muffler. Absent a justification to do so, this Court is\n not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate Treas\n ury Department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by\n any other agency. The Court has \u201c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of\n maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative\n action.\u201d Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154. And the principles\n underlying Chevron apply with full force in the tax context. Chevron\n recognized that an agency\u2019s power \u201c \u2018to administer a congressionally\n created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy\n and the making of rules to fill any gap left . . . by Congress.\u2019 \u201d 467\n U. S., at 843. Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly re\n quires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for\n statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by\n other agencies in administering their statutes.\n    It is true that the full-time employee rule, like the rule at issue in\n National Muffler, was promulgated under the Department\u2019s general\n authority to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en\n forcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a). It is\n also true that this Court, in opinions predating Chevron, stated that\n it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of\n authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific\n grants. See Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247, 253; United\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., 455 U. S. 16, 24. Since then, however,\n  the Court has found Chevron deference appropriate \u201cwhen it appears\n  that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make\n  rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation\n  claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that author\n  ity.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226\u2013227. Chevron\n  and Mead provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full\n  time employee rule. The Department issued the rule pursuant to an\n  explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations, and\n  only after notice-and-comment procedures. The Court has recognized\n  these to be good indicators of a rule meriting Chevron deference,\n  Mead, 533 U. S., at 229\u2013231. Pp. 7\u201312.\n     (c) The rule easily satisfies Chevron\u2019s second step. Mayo accepts\n  the Treasury Department\u2019s determination that an individual may not\n  qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his\n  relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect\n  of that relationship, but objects to the Department\u2019s conclusion that\n  residents working more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot\n  satisfy that requirement. Mayo argues that the Treasury Depart\n  ment should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into\n  what each employee does and why he does it, and that the Depart\n  ment has arbitrarily distinguished between hands-on training and\n  classroom instruction. But regulation, like legislation, often requires\n  drawing lines. The Department reasonably sought to distinguish be\n  tween workers who study and students who work. Focusing on the\n  hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to\n  accomplish that goal. The Department thus has drawn a distinction\n  between education and service, not between classroom instruction\n  and hands-on training. The Treasury Department also reasonably\n  concluded that its full-time employee rule would \u201cimprove adminis\n  trability,\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, and thereby \u201chas avoided the wasteful\n  litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accom\n  pany [a] case-by-case approach\u201d like the one Mayo advocates, United\n  States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302. Moreover, the rule reasonably\n  takes into account the Social Security Administration\u2019s concern that\n  exempting residents from FICA would deprive them and their fami\n  lies of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.\n  Pp. 12\u201315.\n568 F. 3d 675, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other\nMembers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera\ntion or decision of the case.\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

The question presented in this case is\nwhether doctors who serve as medical residents are prop\nerly viewed as \u201cstudent[s]\u201d whose service Congress has\nexempted from FICA taxes under 26 U. S. C. \u00a73121(b)(10).\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Most doctors who graduate from medical school in the\nUnited States pursue additional education in a specialty to\nbecome board certified to practice in that field. Petitioners\nMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research,\nMayo Clinic, and the Regents of the University of Minne\nsota (collectively Mayo) offer medical residency programs\nthat provide such instruction. Mayo\u2019s residency programs,\nwhich usually last three to five years, train doctors pri\nmarily through hands-on experience. Residents often\n2   MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                    UNITED STATES\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nspend between 50 and 80 hours a week caring for patients,\ntypically examining and diagnosing them, prescribing\nmedication, recommending plans of care, and performing\ncertain procedures. Residents are generally supervised in\nthis work by more senior residents and by faculty mem\nbers known as attending physicians. In 2005, Mayo paid\nits residents annual \u201cstipends\u201d ranging between $41,000\nand $56,000 and provided them with health insurance,\nmalpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.\n   Mayo residents also take part in \u201ca formal and struc\ntured educational program.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 5 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Residents are assigned\ntextbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to\nattend weekly lectures and other conferences. Residents\nalso take written exams and are evaluated by the attend\ning faculty physicians. But the parties do not dispute that\nthe bulk of residents\u2019 time is spent caring for patients.\n                            B\n  Through the Social Security Act and related legislation,\nCongress has created a comprehensive national insurance\nsystem that provides benefits for retired workers, disabled\nworkers, unemployed workers, and their families. See\nUnited States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 254, 258, and nn. 1, 7\n(1982). Congress funds Social Security by taxing both\nemployers and employees under FICA on the wages em\nployees earn. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a73101(a) (tax on employees);\n\u00a73111(a) (tax on employers).        Congress has defined\n\u201cwages\u201d broadly, to encompass \u201call remuneration for em\nployment.\u201d \u00a73121(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The term\n\u201cemployment\u201d has a similarly broad reach, extending to\n\u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed . . . by an\nemployee for the person employing him.\u201d \u00a73121(b).\n  Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of\nservice and individuals from FICA\u2019s demands. As relevant\nhere, Congress has excluded from taxation \u201cservice per\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nformed in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university\n. . . if such service is performed by a student who is en\nrolled and regularly attending classes at such school,\ncollege, or university.\u201d \u00a73121(b)(10) (2006 ed.). The Social\nSecurity Act, which governs workers\u2019 eligibility for bene\nfits, contains a corresponding student exception materially\nidentical to \u00a73121(b)(10). 42 U. S. C. \u00a7410(a)(10).\n    Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the\nstudent exception to exempt from taxation students who\nwork for their schools \u201cas an incident to and for the pur\npose of pursuing a course of study\u201d there. 16 Fed. Reg.\n12474 (adopting Treas. Regs. 127, \u00a7408.219(c)); see Treas.\nReg. \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u20132(d), 26 CFR \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u20132(d)\n(2010). Until 2005, the Department determined whether\nan individual\u2019s work was \u201cincident to\u201d his studies by per\nforming a case-by-case analysis. The primary considera\ntions in that analysis were the number of hours worked\nand the course load taken. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 78\u201317,\n1978\u20131 Cum. Bull. 307 (services of individual \u201cemployed\non a full-time basis\u201d with a part-time course load are \u201cnot\nincident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of\nstudy\u201d).\n    For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA)\nalso articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach\nto the corresponding student exception in the Social Secu\nrity Act. See 20 CFR \u00a7404.1028(c) (1998). The SSA has,\nhowever, \u201calways held that resident physicians are not\nstudents.\u201d SSR 78\u20133, 1978 Cum. Bull. 55\u201356. In 1998,\nthe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the\nSSA could not categorically exclude residents from student\nstatus, given that its regulations provided for a case-by\ncase approach. See Minnesota v. Apfel, 151 F. 3d 742,\n747\u2013748. Following that decision, the Internal Revenue\nService received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax\nrefunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as\nstudents under \u00a73121(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n4   MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                    UNITED STATES\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n568 F. 3d 675, 677 (CA8 2009).\n   Facing that flood of claims, the Treasury Department\n\u201cdetermined that it [wa]s necessary to provide additional\nclarification of the ter[m]\u201d \u201cstudent\u201d as used in\n\u00a73121(b)(10), particularly with respect to individuals who\nperform \u201cservices that are in the nature of on the job\ntraining.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (2004). The Department\nproposed an amended rule for comment and held a public\nhearing on it. See id., at 76405.\n   On December 21, 2004, the Department adopted an\namended rule prescribing that an employee\u2019s service is\n\u201cincident\u201d to his studies only when \u201c[t]he educational\naspect of the relationship between the employer and the\nemployee, as compared to the service aspect of the rela\ntionship, [is] predominant.\u201d Id., at 76408; Treas.

The rule categorically provides that\n\u201c[t]he services of a full-time employee\u201d\u2014as defined by the\nemployer\u2019s policies, but in any event including any em\nployee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per\nweek\u2014\u201care not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing\na course of study.\u201d 69 Fed.

The amended\nprovision clarifies that the Department\u2019s analysis \u201cis not\naffected by the fact that the services performed . . . may\nhave an educational, instructional, or training aspect.\u201d\nIbid. The rule also includes as an example the case of\n\u201cEmployee E,\u201d who is employed by \u201cUniversity V\u201d as a\nmedical resident.       69 Fed. Reg. 76409; Treas.

Because Employee E\u2019s \u201cnormal work schedule calls\nfor [him] to perform services 40 or more hours per week,\u201d\nthe rule provides that his service is \u201cnot incident to and for\nthe purpose of pursuing a course of study,\u201d and he accord\ningly is not an exempt \u201cstudent\u201d under \u00a73121(b)(10). 69\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Mayo asserted that its residents were\nexempt under \u00a73121(b)(10) and that the Treasury De\npartment\u2019s full-time employee rule was invalid.\n   The District Court granted Mayo\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment. The court held that the full-time employee rule\nis inconsistent with the unambiguous text of \u00a73121, which\nthe court understood to dictate that \u201can employee is a\n\u2018student\u2019 so long as the educational aspect of his service\npredominates over the service aspect of the relationship\nwith his employer.\u201d 503 F.

The statute does not de\nfine the term \u201cstudent,\u201d and does not otherwise attend to\nthe precise question whether medical residents are subject\nto FICA. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a73121(b)(10).\n   Mayo nonetheless contends that the Treasury Depart\nment\u2019s full-time employee rule must be rejected under\nChevron step one. Mayo argues that the dictionary defini\ntion of \u201cstudent\u201d\u2014one \u201cwho engages in \u2018study\u2019 by applying\nthe mind \u2018to the acquisition of learning, whether by means\nof books, observation, or experiment\u2019 \u201d\u2014plainly encom\npasses residents. Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting Oxford\nUniversal Dictionary 2049\u20132050 (3d ed. 1955)). And,\nMayo adds, residents are not excluded from that category\nby the only limitation on students Congress has imposed\nunder the statute\u2014that they \u201cbe \u2018enrolled and regularly\nattending classes at [a] school.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 22\n(quoting 26 U. S. C. \u00a73121(b)(10)).\n   Mayo\u2019s reading does not eliminate the statute\u2019s ambigu\nity as applied to working professionals. In its reply brief,\nMayo acknowledges that a full-time professor taking\nevening classes\u2014a person who presumably would satisfy\nthe statute\u2019s class-enrollment requirement and apply his\nmind to learning\u2014could be excluded from the exemption\nand taxed because he is not \u201c \u2018predominant[ly]\u2019 \u201d a student.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 7. Medical residents might\nlikewise be excluded on the same basis; the statute itself\ndoes not resolve the ambiguity.\n   The District Court interpreted \u00a73121(b)(10) as unambig\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

Supp. 2d, at 1175. We do not think it possible to glean\nso much from the little that \u00a73121 provides. In any event,\nthe statutory text still would offer no insight into how\nCongress intended predominance to be determined or\nwhether Congress thought that medical residents would\nsatisfy the requirement.\n   To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medi\ncal residents in \u00a73121, moreover, it has expressly excluded\nthese doctors from exemptions they might otherwise in\nvoke. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73121(b)(6)(B), (7)(C)(ii) (excluding\nmedical residents from exemptions available to employees\nof the District of Columbia and the United States). That\nchoice casts doubt on any claim that Congress specifically\nintended to insulate medical residents from FICA\u2019s reach\nin the first place.\n   In sum, neither the plain text of the statute nor the\nDistrict Court\u2019s interpretation of the exemption \u201cspeak[s]\nwith the precision necessary to say definitively whether\n[the statute] applies to\u201d medical residents.

In this case, however, the parties dis\nagree over the proper framework for evaluating an am\nbiguous provision of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mayo asks us to apply the multi-factor analysis we used\n8   MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                    UNITED STATES\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nto review a tax regulation in National Muffler, 440 U. S.\n472. \tThere we explained:\n     \u201cA regulation may have particular force if it is a sub\n     stantially contemporaneous construction of the stat\n     ute by those presumed to have been aware of congres\n     sional intent. If the regulation dates from a later\n     period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry.\n     Other relevant considerations are the length of time\n     the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed\n     on it, the consistency of the Commissioner\u2019s interpre\n     tation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has\n     devoted to the regulation during subsequent re\n     enactments of the statute.\u201d Id., at 477.\nThe Government, on the other hand, contends that the\nNational Muffler standard has been superseded by Chev\nron. The sole question for the Court at step two under the\nChevron analysis is \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based\non a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d 467 U. S., at\n843.\n   Since deciding Chevron, we have cited both National\nMuffler and Chevron in our review of Treasury Depart\nment regulations. See, e.g., United States v. Cleveland\nIndians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 219 (2001) (citing\nNational Muffler); Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner,\n499 U. S. 554, 560\u2013561 (1991) (same); United States v.\nBoyle, 469 U. S. 241, 246, n. 4 (1985) (citing Chevron); see\nalso Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523 U. S. 382,\n387, 389 (1998) (citing Chevron and Cottage Savings).\n   Although we have not thus far distinguished between\nNational Muffler and Chevron, they call for different\nanalyses of an ambiguous statute. Under National Muf\nfler, for example, a court might view an agency\u2019s interpre\ntation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has\nnot been consistent over time, when it was promulgated\nyears after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The District Court in this case cited each of these\nfactors in rejecting the Treasury Department\u2019s rule, noting\nin particular that the regulation had been promulgated\nafter an adverse judicial decision. See 503 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41\u201344 (relying on the\nsame considerations).\n   Under Chevron, in contrast, deference to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on\nsuch considerations.      We have repeatedly held that\n\u201c[a]gency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.\u201d National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.\nv. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005);\naccord, Eurodif S. A., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). We\nhave instructed that \u201cneither antiquity nor contempora\nneity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation\u2019s]\nvalidity.\u201d Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517\nU. S. 735, 740 (1996). And we have found it immaterial to\nour analysis that a \u201cregulation was prompted by litiga\ntion.\u201d Id., at 741. Indeed, in United Dominion Industries,\nInc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 838 (2001), we ex\npressly invited the Treasury Department to \u201camend its\nregulations\u201d if troubled by the consequences of our resolu\ntion of the case.\n   Aside from our past citation of National Muffler, Mayo\nhas not advanced any justification for applying a less\ndeferential standard of review to Treasury Department\nregulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency.\nIn the absence of such justification, we are not inclined\nto carve out an approach to administrative review good\nfor tax law only. To the contrary, we have expressly\n\u201c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform\napproach to judicial review of administrative action.\u201d\nDickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.

AND RESEARCH v.\n                   UNITED STATES\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n223 (1989) (declining to apply \u201ca different and stricter\nnondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates\ndiscretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing\npower\u201d).\n   The principles underlying our decision in Chevron apply\nwith full force in the tax context. Chevron recognized that\n\u201c[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a\ncongressionally created . . . program necessarily requires\nthe formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill\nany gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d 467\nU. S., at 843 (internal quotation marks omitted). It ac\nknowledged that the formulation of that policy might\nrequire \u201cmore than ordinary knowledge respecting the\nmatters subjected to agency regulations.\u201d Id., at 844\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Filling gaps in the\nInternal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury\nDepartment to make interpretive choices for statutory\nimplementation at least as complex as the ones other\nagencies must make in administering their statutes. Cf.\nBob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 596\n(1983) (\u201c[I]n an area as complex as the tax system, the\nagency Congress vests with administrative responsibility\nmust be able to exercise its authority to meet changing\nconditions and new problems\u201d). We see no reason why our\nreview of tax regulations should not be guided by agency\nexpertise pursuant to Chevron to the same extent as our\nreview of other regulations.\n   As one of Mayo\u2019s amici points out, however, both the\nfull-time employee rule and the rule at issue in National\nMuffler were promulgated pursuant to the Treasury De\npartment\u2019s general authority under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a) to\n\u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en\nforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. See Brief for\nCarlton M. Smith 4\u20137.

United States, 452\nU. S. 247, 253 (1981); United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.,\n455 U. S. 16, 24 (1982) (quoting Rowan).\n   Since Rowan and Vogel were decided, however, the\nadministrative landscape has changed significantly. We\nhave held that Chevron deference is appropriate \u201cwhen it\nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that\nthe agency interpretation claiming deference was promul\ngated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d Mead, 533 U. S.,\nat 226\u2013227. Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on\nwhether Congress\u2019s delegation of authority was general or\nspecific. For example, in National Cable & Telecommuni\ncations Assn., supra, we held that the Federal Communi\ncations Commission was delegated \u201cthe authority to prom\nulgate binding legal rules\u201d entitled to Chevron deference\nunder statutes that gave the Commission \u201cthe authority to\n\u2018execute and enforce,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cto \u2018prescribe such rules and\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest to\ncarry out the provisions\u2019 of,\u201d the Communications Act of\n1934. 545 U. S., at 980\u2013981 (quoting 47 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7151,\n201(b)). See also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 87,\n88\u201389 (1990) (applying Chevron deference to rule promul\ngated pursuant to delegation of \u201cgeneral authority to\n\u2018make rules and regulations and to establish procedures,\nnot inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter,\nwhich are necessary or appropriate to carry out such\nprovisions\u2019 \u201d (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(a) (1982 ed.))).\n   We believe Chevron and Mead, rather than National\nMuffler and Rowan, provide the appropriate framework\nfor evaluating the full-time employee rule. The Depart\nment issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the\nexplicit authorization to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and\n12 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                   UNITED STATES\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nregulations for the enforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue\nCode. 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a). We have found such \u201cexpress\ncongressional authorizations to engage in the process of\nrulemaking\u201d to be \u201ca very good indicator of delegation\nmeriting Chevron treatment.\u201d Mead, supra, at 229. The\nDepartment issued the full-time employee rule only after\nnotice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again\na consideration identified in our precedents as a \u201csignifi\ncant\u201d sign that a rule merits Chevron deference. Mead,\nsupra, at 230\u2013231; see, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 173\u2013174 (2007).\n  We have explained that \u201cthe ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended, and expected,\ncourts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of \u2018gap-filling\u2019 authority.\u201d Id., at\n173 (emphasis deleted). In the Long Island Care case, we\nfound that Chevron provided the appropriate standard of\nreview \u201c[w]here an agency rule sets forth important indi\nvidual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully\nand directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full\nnotice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule,\n[and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory\ngrant of authority.\u201d 551 U. S., at 173. These same consid\nerations point to the same result here. This case falls\nsquarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed\nunder, Chevron and Mead.\n                              C\n   The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second\nstep of Chevron, which asks whether the Department\u2019s\nrule is a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the enacted text.\n467 U. S., at 844. To begin, Mayo accepts that \u201cthe \u2018educa\ntional aspect of the relationship between the employer and\nthe employee, as compared to the service aspect of the\nrelationship, [must] be predominant\u2019 \u201d in order for an\nindividual to qualify for the exemption.

Mayo ob\njects, however, to the Department\u2019s conclusion that resi\ndents who work more than 40 hours per week categorically\ncannot satisfy that requirement. Because residents\u2019 em\nployment is itself educational, Mayo argues, the hours a\nresident spends working make him \u201cmore of a student, not\nless of one.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, n. 3 (emphasis\ndeleted). Mayo contends that the Treasury Department\nshould be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into\n\u201cwhat [each] employee does [in his service] and why\u201d he\ndoes it. Id., at 7. Mayo also objects that the Department\nhas drawn an arbitrary distinction between \u201chands-on\ntraining\u201d and \u201cclassroom instruction.\u201d Brief for Petition\ners 35.\n   We disagree. Regulation, like legislation, often requires\ndrawing lines. Mayo does not dispute that the Treasury\nDepartment reasonably sought a way to distinguish be\ntween workers who study and students who work, see IRS\nLetter Ruling 9332005 (May 3, 1993). Focusing on the\nhours an individual works and the hours he spends in\nstudies is a perfectly sensible way of accomplishing that\ngoal. The Department explained that an individual\u2019s\nservice and his \u201ccourse of study are separate and distinct\nactivities\u201d in \u201cthe vast majority of cases,\u201d and reasoned\nthat \u201c[e]mployees who are working enough hours to be\nconsidered full-time employees . . . have filled the conven\ntional measure of available time with work, and not\nstudy.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8607. The Department thus did not\ndistinguish classroom education from clinical training but\nrather education from service. The Department reasona\nbly concluded that its full-time employee rule would \u201cim\nprove administrability,\u201d id., at 76405, and it thereby \u201chas\navoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty\nthat would inevitably accompany any purely case-by-case\napproach\u201d like the one Mayo advocates, United States v.\n14 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED.

S. 299, 302 (1967).\n  As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover,\nthe full-time employee rule has more to recommend it\nthan administrative convenience. The Department rea\nsonably determined that taxing residents under FICA\nwould further the purpose of the Social Security Act and\ncomport with this Court\u2019s precedent. As the Treasury\nDepartment appreciated, this Court has understood the\nterms of the Social Security Act to \u201c \u2018import a breadth of\ncoverage,\u2019 \u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting Social Security Bd.\nv. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365 (1946)), and we have in\nstructed that \u201cexemptions from taxation are to be con\nstrued narrowly,\u201d Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U. S. 741, 752\n(1969). Although Mayo contends that medical residents\nhave not yet begun their \u201cworking lives\u201d because they are\nnot \u201cfully trained,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did\nnot act irrationally in concluding that these doctors\u2014\u201cwho\nwork long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and\ntypically share some or all of the terms of employment of\ncareer employees\u201d\u2014are the kind of workers that Congress\nintended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social\nSecurity system. 69 Fed. Reg. 8608.\n  The Department\u2019s rule takes into account the SSA\u2019s\nconcern that exempting residents from FICA would de\nprive residents and their families of vital disability and\nsurvivorship benefits that Social Security provides. Id., at\n8605. Mayo wonders whether the full-time employee rule\nwill result in residents being taxed under FICA but denied\ncoverage by the SSA. The Government informs us, how\never, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding\nposition that medical residents are not students and thus\nremain eligible for coverage.

In 2004,\n  the Department issued regulations providing that \u201c[t]he services of a\n  full-time employee\u201d\u2014which includes an employee normally scheduled\n  to work 40 hours or more per week\u2014\u201care not incident to and for the\n  purpose of pursuing a course of study.\u201d 26 CFR \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u2013\n  2(d)(3)(iii). The Department explained that this analysis \u201cis not af\n  fected by the fact that the services . . . may have an educational, in\n2    MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                     UNITED STATES\n                        Syllabus\n\n    structional, or training aspect.\u201d Ibid. The rule offers as an example a\n    medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform ser\n    vices 40 or more hours per week, and concludes that the resident is\n    not a student.\n       Mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid, and the Dis\n    trict Court agreed. It found the full-time employee rule inconsistent\n    with \u00a73121\u2019s unambiguous text and concluded that the factors gov\n    erning this Court\u2019s analysis in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v.\n    United States, 440 U. S. 472, also indicated that the rule was invalid.\n    The Eighth Circuit reversed. Applying Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\n    ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, the Court of Ap\n    peals concluded that the Department\u2019s regulation was a permissible\n    interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\nHeld: The Treasury Department\u2019s full-time employee rule is a reason\n able construction of \u00a73121(b)(10). Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) Under Chevron\u2019s two-part framework, the Court first asks\n whether Congress has \u201cdirectly addressed the precise question at is\n sue.\u201d 467 U. S., at 842-843. Congress has not done so here; the stat\n ute does not define \u201cstudent\u201d or otherwise attend to the question\n whether medical residents are subject to FICA. Pp. 6\u20137.\n    (b) The parties debate whether the Court should next apply Chev\n ron step two or the multi-factor analysis used to review a tax regula\n tion in National Muffler. Absent a justification to do so, this Court is\n not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate Treas\n ury Department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by\n any other agency. The Court has \u201c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of\n maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative\n action.\u201d Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154. And the principles\n underlying Chevron apply with full force in the tax context. Chevron\n recognized that an agency\u2019s power \u201c \u2018to administer a congressionally\n created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy\n and the making of rules to fill any gap left . . . by Congress.\u2019 \u201d 467\n U. S., at 843. Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly re\n quires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for\n statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by\n other agencies in administering their statutes.\n    It is true that the full-time employee rule, like the rule at issue in\n National Muffler, was promulgated under the Department\u2019s general\n authority to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en\n forcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a). It is\n also true that this Court, in opinions predating Chevron, stated that\n it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of\n authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific\n grants. See Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247, 253; United\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., 455 U. S. 16, 24. Since then, however,\n  the Court has found Chevron deference appropriate \u201cwhen it appears\n  that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make\n  rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation\n  claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that author\n  ity.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226\u2013227. Chevron\n  and Mead provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full\n  time employee rule. The Department issued the rule pursuant to an\n  explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations, and\n  only after notice-and-comment procedures. The Court has recognized\n  these to be good indicators of a rule meriting Chevron deference,\n  Mead, 533 U. S., at 229\u2013231. Pp. 7\u201312.\n     (c) The rule easily satisfies Chevron\u2019s second step. Mayo accepts\n  the Treasury Department\u2019s determination that an individual may not\n  qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his\n  relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect\n  of that relationship, but objects to the Department\u2019s conclusion that\n  residents working more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot\n  satisfy that requirement. Mayo argues that the Treasury Depart\n  ment should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into\n  what each employee does and why he does it, and that the Depart\n  ment has arbitrarily distinguished between hands-on training and\n  classroom instruction. But regulation, like legislation, often requires\n  drawing lines. The Department reasonably sought to distinguish be\n  tween workers who study and students who work. Focusing on the\n  hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to\n  accomplish that goal. The Department thus has drawn a distinction\n  between education and service, not between classroom instruction\n  and hands-on training. The Treasury Department also reasonably\n  concluded that its full-time employee rule would \u201cimprove adminis\n  trability,\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, and thereby \u201chas avoided the wasteful\n  litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accom\n  pany [a] case-by-case approach\u201d like the one Mayo advocates, United\n  States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 302. Moreover, the rule reasonably\n  takes into account the Social Security Administration\u2019s concern that\n  exempting residents from FICA would deprive them and their fami\n  lies of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.\n  Pp. 12\u201315.\n568 F. 3d 675, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

The question presented in this case is\nwhether doctors who serve as medical residents are prop\nerly viewed as \u201cstudent[s]\u201d whose service Congress has\nexempted from FICA taxes under 26 U.

Petitioners\nMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research,\nMayo Clinic, and the Regents of the University of Minne\nsota (collectively Mayo) offer medical residency programs\nthat provide such instruction. Mayo\u2019s residency programs,\nwhich usually last three to five years, train doctors pri\nmarily through hands-on experience. Residents often\n2   MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED.

Residents are generally supervised in\nthis work by more senior residents and by faculty mem\nbers known as attending physicians. In 2005, Mayo paid\nits residents annual \u201cstipends\u201d ranging between $41,000\nand $56,000 and provided them with health insurance,\nmalpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.\n   Mayo residents also take part in \u201ca formal and struc\ntured educational program.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 5 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Residents are assigned\ntextbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to\nattend weekly lectures and other conferences. Residents\nalso take written exams and are evaluated by the attend\ning faculty physicians. But the parties do not dispute that\nthe bulk of residents\u2019 time is spent caring for patients.\n                            B\n  Through the Social Security Act and related legislation,\nCongress has created a comprehensive national insurance\nsystem that provides benefits for retired workers, disabled\nworkers, unemployed workers, and their families. See\nUnited States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 254, 258, and nn. 1, 7\n(1982). Congress funds Social Security by taxing both\nemployers and employees under FICA on the wages em\nployees earn. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a73101(a) (tax on employees);\n\u00a73111(a) (tax on employers).        Congress has defined\n\u201cwages\u201d broadly, to encompass \u201call remuneration for em\nployment.\u201d \u00a73121(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The term\n\u201cemployment\u201d has a similarly broad reach, extending to\n\u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed . . . by an\nemployee for the person employing him.\u201d \u00a73121(b).\n  Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of\nservice and individuals from FICA\u2019s demands. As relevant\nhere, Congress has excluded from taxation \u201cservice per\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

The Social\nSecurity Act, which governs workers\u2019 eligibility for bene\nfits, contains a corresponding student exception materially\nidentical to \u00a73121(b)(10). 42 U. S.

Until 2005, the Department determined whether\nan individual\u2019s work was \u201cincident to\u201d his studies by per\nforming a case-by-case analysis. The primary considera\ntions in that analysis were the number of hours worked\nand the course load taken. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 78\u201317,\n1978\u20131 Cum. Bull. 307 (services of individual \u201cemployed\non a full-time basis\u201d with a part-time course load are \u201cnot\nincident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of\nstudy\u201d).\n    For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA)\nalso articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach\nto the corresponding student exception in the Social Secu\nrity Act. See 20 CFR \u00a7404.1028(c) (1998). The SSA has,\nhowever, \u201calways held that resident physicians are not\nstudents.\u201d SSR 78\u20133, 1978 Cum. Bull. 55\u201356. In 1998,\nthe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the\nSSA could not categorically exclude residents from student\nstatus, given that its regulations provided for a case-by\ncase approach. See Minnesota v. Apfel, 151 F. 3d 742,\n747\u2013748. Following that decision, the Internal Revenue\nService received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax\nrefunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as\nstudents under \u00a73121(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n4   MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED.

AND RESEARCH v.\n                    UNITED STATES\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nto review a tax regulation in National Muffler, 440 U. S.\n472. \tThere we explained:\n     \u201cA regulation may have particular force if it is a sub\n     stantially contemporaneous construction of the stat\n     ute by those presumed to have been aware of congres\n     sional intent. If the regulation dates from a later\n     period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry.\n     Other relevant considerations are the length of time\n     the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed\n     on it, the consistency of the Commissioner\u2019s interpre\n     tation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has\n     devoted to the regulation during subsequent re\n     enactments of the statute.\u201d Id., at 477.\nThe Government, on the other hand, contends that the\nNational Muffler standard has been superseded by Chev\nron. The sole question for the Court at step two under the\nChevron analysis is \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based\non a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d 467 U. S., at\n843.\n   Since deciding Chevron, we have cited both National\nMuffler and Chevron in our review of Treasury Depart\nment regulations. See, e.g., United States v. Cleveland\nIndians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 219 (2001) (citing\nNational Muffler); Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner,\n499 U. S. 554, 560\u2013561 (1991) (same); United States v.\nBoyle, 469 U. S. 241, 246, n. 4 (1985) (citing Chevron); see\nalso Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523 U. S. 382,\n387, 389 (1998) (citing Chevron and Cottage Savings).\n   Although we have not thus far distinguished between\nNational Muffler and Chevron, they call for different\nanalyses of an ambiguous statute. Under National Muf\nfler, for example, a court might view an agency\u2019s interpre\ntation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has\nnot been consistent over time, when it was promulgated\nyears after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe way in which the regulation evolved. 440 U. S., at\n477. The District Court in this case cited each of these\nfactors in rejecting the Treasury Department\u2019s rule, noting\nin particular that the regulation had been promulgated\nafter an adverse judicial decision. See 503 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41\u201344 (relying on the\nsame considerations).\n   Under Chevron, in contrast, deference to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on\nsuch considerations.      We have repeatedly held that\n\u201c[a]gency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.\u201d National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.\nv. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005);\naccord, Eurodif S. A., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). We\nhave instructed that \u201cneither antiquity nor contempora\nneity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation\u2019s]\nvalidity.\u201d Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517\nU. S. 735, 740 (1996). And we have found it immaterial to\nour analysis that a \u201cregulation was prompted by litiga\ntion.\u201d Id., at 741. Indeed, in United Dominion Industries,\nInc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 838 (2001), we ex\npressly invited the Treasury Department to \u201camend its\nregulations\u201d if troubled by the consequences of our resolu\ntion of the case.\n   Aside from our past citation of National Muffler, Mayo\nhas not advanced any justification for applying a less\ndeferential standard of review to Treasury Department\nregulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency.\nIn the absence of such justification, we are not inclined\nto carve out an approach to administrative review good\nfor tax law only. To the contrary, we have expressly\n\u201c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform\napproach to judicial review of administrative action.\u201d\nDickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 154 (1999). See, e.g.,\nSkinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212, 222\u2013\n10 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                   UNITED STATES\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n223 (1989) (declining to apply \u201ca different and stricter\nnondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates\ndiscretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing\npower\u201d).\n   The principles underlying our decision in Chevron apply\nwith full force in the tax context. Chevron recognized that\n\u201c[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a\ncongressionally created . . . program necessarily requires\nthe formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill\nany gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d 467\nU. S., at 843 (internal quotation marks omitted). It ac\nknowledged that the formulation of that policy might\nrequire \u201cmore than ordinary knowledge respecting the\nmatters subjected to agency regulations.\u201d Id., at 844\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Filling gaps in the\nInternal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury\nDepartment to make interpretive choices for statutory\nimplementation at least as complex as the ones other\nagencies must make in administering their statutes. Cf.\nBob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 596\n(1983) (\u201c[I]n an area as complex as the tax system, the\nagency Congress vests with administrative responsibility\nmust be able to exercise its authority to meet changing\nconditions and new problems\u201d). We see no reason why our\nreview of tax regulations should not be guided by agency\nexpertise pursuant to Chevron to the same extent as our\nreview of other regulations.\n   As one of Mayo\u2019s amici points out, however, both the\nfull-time employee rule and the rule at issue in National\nMuffler were promulgated pursuant to the Treasury De\npartment\u2019s general authority under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a) to\n\u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the en\nforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. See Brief for\nCarlton M. Smith 4\u20137. In two decisions predating Chev\nron, this Court stated that \u201cwe owe the [Treasury Depart\nment\u2019s] interpretation less deference\u201d when it is contained\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin a rule adopted under that \u201cgeneral authority\u201d than\nwhen it is \u201cissued under a specific grant of authority to\ndefine a statutory term or prescribe a method of executing\na statutory provision.\u201d Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452\nU. S. 247, 253 (1981); United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.,\n455 U. S. 16, 24 (1982) (quoting Rowan).\n   Since Rowan and Vogel were decided, however, the\nadministrative landscape has changed significantly. We\nhave held that Chevron deference is appropriate \u201cwhen it\nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that\nthe agency interpretation claiming deference was promul\ngated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d Mead, 533 U. S.,\nat 226\u2013227. Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on\nwhether Congress\u2019s delegation of authority was general or\nspecific. For example, in National Cable & Telecommuni\ncations Assn., supra, we held that the Federal Communi\ncations Commission was delegated \u201cthe authority to prom\nulgate binding legal rules\u201d entitled to Chevron deference\nunder statutes that gave the Commission \u201cthe authority to\n\u2018execute and enforce,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cto \u2018prescribe such rules and\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest to\ncarry out the provisions\u2019 of,\u201d the Communications Act of\n1934. 545 U. S., at 980\u2013981 (quoting 47 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7151,\n201(b)). See also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 87,\n88\u201389 (1990) (applying Chevron deference to rule promul\ngated pursuant to delegation of \u201cgeneral authority to\n\u2018make rules and regulations and to establish procedures,\nnot inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter,\nwhich are necessary or appropriate to carry out such\nprovisions\u2019 \u201d (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(a) (1982 ed.))).\n   We believe Chevron and Mead, rather than National\nMuffler and Rowan, provide the appropriate framework\nfor evaluating the full-time employee rule. The Depart\nment issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the\nexplicit authorization to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and\n12 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                   UNITED STATES\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nregulations for the enforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue\nCode. 26 U. S. C. \u00a77805(a). We have found such \u201cexpress\ncongressional authorizations to engage in the process of\nrulemaking\u201d to be \u201ca very good indicator of delegation\nmeriting Chevron treatment.\u201d Mead, supra, at 229. The\nDepartment issued the full-time employee rule only after\nnotice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again\na consideration identified in our precedents as a \u201csignifi\ncant\u201d sign that a rule merits Chevron deference. Mead,\nsupra, at 230\u2013231; see, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 173\u2013174 (2007).\n  We have explained that \u201cthe ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended, and expected,\ncourts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of \u2018gap-filling\u2019 authority.\u201d Id., at\n173 (emphasis deleted). In the Long Island Care case, we\nfound that Chevron provided the appropriate standard of\nreview \u201c[w]here an agency rule sets forth important indi\nvidual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully\nand directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full\nnotice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule,\n[and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory\ngrant of authority.\u201d 551 U. S., at 173. These same consid\nerations point to the same result here. This case falls\nsquarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed\nunder, Chevron and Mead.\n                              C\n   The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second\nstep of Chevron, which asks whether the Department\u2019s\nrule is a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the enacted text.\n467 U. S., at 844. To begin, Mayo accepts that \u201cthe \u2018educa\ntional aspect of the relationship between the employer and\nthe employee, as compared to the service aspect of the\nrelationship, [must] be predominant\u2019 \u201d in order for an\nindividual to qualify for the exemption. Reply Brief for\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners 6\u20137 (quoting Treas. Reg. \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u2013\n2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR \u00a731.3121(b)(10)\u20132(d)(3)(i)). Mayo ob\njects, however, to the Department\u2019s conclusion that resi\ndents who work more than 40 hours per week categorically\ncannot satisfy that requirement. Because residents\u2019 em\nployment is itself educational, Mayo argues, the hours a\nresident spends working make him \u201cmore of a student, not\nless of one.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, n. 3 (emphasis\ndeleted). Mayo contends that the Treasury Department\nshould be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into\n\u201cwhat [each] employee does [in his service] and why\u201d he\ndoes it. Id., at 7. Mayo also objects that the Department\nhas drawn an arbitrary distinction between \u201chands-on\ntraining\u201d and \u201cclassroom instruction.\u201d Brief for Petition\ners 35.\n   We disagree. Regulation, like legislation, often requires\ndrawing lines. Mayo does not dispute that the Treasury\nDepartment reasonably sought a way to distinguish be\ntween workers who study and students who work, see IRS\nLetter Ruling 9332005 (May 3, 1993). Focusing on the\nhours an individual works and the hours he spends in\nstudies is a perfectly sensible way of accomplishing that\ngoal. The Department explained that an individual\u2019s\nservice and his \u201ccourse of study are separate and distinct\nactivities\u201d in \u201cthe vast majority of cases,\u201d and reasoned\nthat \u201c[e]mployees who are working enough hours to be\nconsidered full-time employees . . . have filled the conven\ntional measure of available time with work, and not\nstudy.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8607. The Department thus did not\ndistinguish classroom education from clinical training but\nrather education from service. The Department reasona\nbly concluded that its full-time employee rule would \u201cim\nprove administrability,\u201d id., at 76405, and it thereby \u201chas\navoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty\nthat would inevitably accompany any purely case-by-case\napproach\u201d like the one Mayo advocates, United States v.\n14 MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL ED. AND RESEARCH v.\n                   UNITED STATES\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nCorrell, 389 U. S. 299, 302 (1967).\n  As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover,\nthe full-time employee rule has more to recommend it\nthan administrative convenience. The Department rea\nsonably determined that taxing residents under FICA\nwould further the purpose of the Social Security Act and\ncomport with this Court\u2019s precedent. As the Treasury\nDepartment appreciated, this Court has understood the\nterms of the Social Security Act to \u201c \u2018import a breadth of\ncoverage,\u2019 \u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting Social Security Bd.\nv. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 365 (1946)), and we have in\nstructed that \u201cexemptions from taxation are to be con\nstrued narrowly,\u201d Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U. S. 741, 752\n(1969). Although Mayo contends that medical residents\nhave not yet begun their \u201cworking lives\u201d because they are\nnot \u201cfully trained,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did\nnot act irrationally in concluding that these doctors\u2014\u201cwho\nwork long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and\ntypically share some or all of the terms of employment of\ncareer employees\u201d\u2014are the kind of workers that Congress\nintended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social\nSecurity system. 69 Fed. Reg. 8608.\n  The Department\u2019s rule takes into account the SSA\u2019s\nconcern that exempting residents from FICA would de\nprive residents and their families of vital disability and\nsurvivorship benefits that Social Security provides. Id., at\n8605. Mayo wonders whether the full-time employee rule\nwill result in residents being taxed under FICA but denied\ncoverage by the SSA. The Government informs us, how\never, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding\nposition that medical residents are not students and thus\nremain eligible for coverage.
