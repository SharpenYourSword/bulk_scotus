NELSON ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u2013530.     Argued October 5, 2010\u2014Decided January 19, 2011\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a\n  workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract em\n  ployees. Respondents are contract employees at NASA\u2019s Jet Propul\n  sion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute\n  of Technology (Cal Tech). Respondents were not subject to Govern\n  ment background checks at the time they were hired, but that\n  changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identifi\n  cation standards for both federal civil servants and contractor em\n  ployees. The Department of Commerce mandated that contract em\n  ployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard\n  background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquir\n  ies (NACI), by October 2007. NASA modified its contract with Cal\n  Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that em\n  ployees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be de\n  nied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.\n    The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins\n  with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form\n  85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF\u201385)). SF\u201385\n  asks whether an employee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manu\n  factured illegal drugs\u201d in the last year. If so, the employee must pro\n  vide details, including information about \u201ctreatment or counseling re\n  ceived.\u201d The employee must also sign a release authorizing the\n  Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers,\n  and others during its investigation. Once SF\u201385 is completed, the\n  Government sends the employee\u2019s references a questionnaire (Form\n  42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have \u201cany\n  reason to question\u201d the employee\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthiness,\u201d or\n2                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have \u201cadverse information\u201d concerning a variety of other matters. All\n    SF\u201385 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the\n    Privacy Act.\n       With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near,\n    respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the back\n    ground-check process violates a constitutional right to informational\n    privacy. The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunc\n    tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that SF\u201385\u2019s inquiries\n    into recent drug involvement furthered the Government\u2019s interest in\n    combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug \u201ctreatment or counsel\n    ing\u201d question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to\n    be held unconstitutional. It also held that Form 42\u2019s open-ended\n    questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government\u2019s inter\n    ests in verifying contractors\u2019 identities and ensuring JPL\u2019s security,\n    and thus also likely violated respondents\u2019 informational-privacy\n    rights.\nHeld:\n    1. In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred\n broadly to a constitutional privacy \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure of\n personal matters.\u201d Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600; Nixon v.\n Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457. In Whalen, the\n Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and\n addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the\n statute\u2019s \u201csecurity provisions,\u201d which protected against \u201cpublic disclo\n sure\u201d of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600\u2013601, were sufficient to\n protect a privacy interest \u201carguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,\u201d\n id., at 605. In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former\n President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for\n archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at is\n sue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against \u201cundue dis\n semination of private materials.\u201d 433 U. S, at 458. Since Nixon, the\n Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to in\n formational privacy. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    2. Assuming, without deciding, that the Government\u2019s challenged\n inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance,\n that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government\n from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF\u201385 and\n Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject\n to the Privacy Act\u2019s safeguards against public disclosure. Pp. 10\u201324.\n       (a) The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests\n at stake. Pp. 11\u201319.\n         (1) Judicial review of the forms must take into account the con\n text in which the Government\u2019s challenged inquiries arise. When the\n Government acts in its capacity \u201cas proprietor\u201d and manager of its\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\u201cinternal operation,\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to\ncitizens generally. The questions respondents challenge are part of a\nstandard background check of the sort used by millions of private\nemployers. The Government has been conducting employment inves\ntigations since the Republic\u2019s earliest days, and the President has\nhad statutory authority to assess an applicant\u2019s fitness for the civil\nservice since 1871. Standard background investigations similar to\nthose at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates\nin 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision\nto extend that requirement to federal contract employees. This his\ntory shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and\nto employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people\u2019s\nbusiness. The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents\nare contract employees. There are no meaningful distinctions in the\nduties of NASA\u2019s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at\nJPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA\u2019s\nmission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer in\nvestment. Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (2) The challenged questions on SF\u201385 and Form 42 are rea\nsonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government\u2019s\ninterests in managing its internal operations. SF\u201385\u2019s \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry\nabout illegal-drug use. In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also\na reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recog\nnizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue,\nseeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to ad\ndress and overcome their problems. Thus, it uses responses to the\ndrug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor cre\ndentialing decisions. The Court rejects the argument that the Gov\nernment has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its em\nployment background questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard\nruns directly contrary to Whalen. See 429 U. S., at 596\u2013597. Pp. 16\u2013\n18.\n       (3) Like SF\u201385\u2019s drug-treatment question, Form 42\u2019s open\nended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employ\nees who will faithfully conduct the Government\u2019s business. Asking\nan applicant\u2019s designated references broad questions about job suit\nability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from\nweak ones. The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by\ntheir pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     (b) In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government in\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    terests at stake, SF\u201385 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial\n    protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec\n    ognized that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted\n    disclosures\u201d generally allays privacy concerns created by government\n    \u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic purposes.\u201d\n    Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government\u2019s\n    collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in\n    formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo\n    sure. The Privacy Act\u2014which allows the Government to maintain\n    only those records \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a purpose\n    authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(1); requires written consent be\n    fore the Government may disclose an individual\u2019s records, \u00a7552a(b);\n    and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo\n    sure obligations, \u00a7552a(i)(1)\u2014\u201cevidence[s] a proper concern\u201d for indi\n    vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458\u2013459.\n    Respondents\u2019 claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s\n    disclosure bar, see \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(1)\u2013(12), leave its protections too porous\n    to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But\n    that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and\n    the Privacy Act.

Roe,\n429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents\nin this case, federal contract employees at a Government\nlaboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment\nbackground investigation violate their rights under\nWhalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a\nform questionnaire that asks employees about treatment\nor counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object\nto certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ\nees\u2019 designated references.\n   We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution\nprotects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen\nand Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por\ntions of the Government\u2019s background check do not violate\nthis right in the present case.

L. 111\u2013314, \u00a73, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.\n\u00a720112(a)(1). NASA\u2019s workforce numbers in the tens of\nthousands of employees. While many of these workers are\nfederal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed\ndirectly by Government contractors. Contract employees\nplay an important role in NASA\u2019s mission, and their du\nties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil\nservants.\n   One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\nin Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract\nemployees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute\nof Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a\nGovernment contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for\ndeep-space robotics and communications. Most of this\ncountry\u2019s unmanned space missions\u2014from the Explorer 1\nsatellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today\u2014have been\ndeveloped and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to\nNASA earth-observation and technology-development\nprojects.

At the time when respondents were\nhired, background checks were standard only for federal\ncivil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936\n(1949\u20131953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con\ntracts required background checks for the employees of\nfederal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.\n   The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate\nthis two-track approach to background investigations.\nIn 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission\nprompted the President to order new, uniform identifica\ntion standards for \u201c[f]ederal employees,\u201d including \u201ccon\ntractor employees.\u201d       Homeland Security Presidential\nDirective/HSPD\u201312\u2014Policy for a Common Identification\nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public\nPapers of the President, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Aug. 27,\np. 1765 (2007) (hereinafter HSPD\u201312), App. 127. The\nDepartment of Commerce implemented this directive by\nmandating that contract employees with long-term access\nto federal facilities complete a standard background check,\ntypically the National Agency Check with Inquiries\n(NACI).

Office of Personnel Manage\nment (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for Non-\nSensitive Positions, App. 88\u201395.2\n   Most of the questions on SF\u201385 seek basic biographical\ninformation: name, address, prior residences, education,\nemployment history, and personal and professional refer\nences. The form also asks about citizenship, selective\nservice registration, and military service. The last ques\ntion asks whether the employee has \u201cused, possessed,\nsupplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\u201d in the last year.\nId., at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide\ndetails, including information about \u201cany treatment or\ncounseling received.\u201d Ibid. A \u201ctruthful response,\u201d the\nform notes, cannot be used as evidence against the em\nployee in a criminal proceeding. Ibid.

App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara\ntory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents\u2019\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit\ngranted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713\n(2007), and later reversed the District Court\u2019s order. The\ncourt held that portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42 are\nlikely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en\njoined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d\n865 (2008).\n   Turning first to SF\u201385, the Court of Appeals noted\nrespondents\u2019 concession \u201cthat most of the questions\u201d on the\nform are \u201cunproblematic\u201d and do not \u201cimplicate the consti\ntutional right to informational privacy.\u201d 530 F. 3d, at 878.\nBut the court determined that the \u201cgroup of questions\nconcerning illegal drugs\u201d required closer scrutiny. Ibid.\nApplying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF\u201385\u2019s\ninquiries into recent involvement with drugs as \u201cnecessary\nto further the government\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d in combat\ning illegal-drug use. Id., at 879. The court went on to\nhold, however, that the portion of the form requiring\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Respondents sought to represent a class of \u201cJPL employees in non\n\nsensitive positions.\u201d App. 79. No class has been certified.\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndisclosure of drug \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d furthered no\nlegitimate interest and was thus likely to be held uncon\nstitutional. Ibid.\n   Form 42, in the Court of Appeals\u2019 estimation, was even\n\u201cmore problematic.\u201d Ibid. The form\u2019s \u201copen-ended and\nhighly private\u201d questions, the court concluded, were not\n\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet the Government\u2019s interests in\nverifying contractors\u2019 identities and \u201censuring the security\nof the JPL.\u201d Id., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held,\nthese \u201copen-ended\u201d questions, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF\u201385, likely violate respondents\u2019 informa\ntional-privacy rights.5\n   Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc. 568 F. 3d 1028 (2009). We\ngranted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also challenged the criteria that\n\nthey believe the Government will use to determine their \u201csuitability\u201d\nfor employment at JPL. Respondents relied on a document, which had\nbeen temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur\nportedly bearing on suitability for federal employment. App. 98\u2013104.\nAmong the listed factors were a failure to \u201cmee[t] financial obligations,\u201d\n\u201chealth issues,\u201d and \u201cmental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric\nissues.\u201d Id., at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under the\nheading \u201cCriminal or Immoral Conduct,\u201d included \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d\n\u201cvoyeurism,\u201d \u201cindecent proposal[s],\u201d and \u201ccarnal knowledge.\u201d Id., at 98.\nThe document also stated that while \u201chomosexuality,\u201d \u201cadultery,\u201d and\n\u201cillegitimate children\u201d were not \u201csuitability\u201d issues in and of them\nselves, they might pose \u201csecurity issue[s]\u201d if circumstances indicated a\n\u201csusceptibility to coercion or blackmail.\u201d Id., at 102. The Court of\nAppeals rejected respondents\u2019 \u201cchallenges to . . . suitability determina\ntion[s]\u201d as unripe. 530 F. 3d, at 873. Although respondents did not file\na cross-petition from that portion of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment, they\nnonetheless discuss these suitability criteria at some length in their\nbrief before this Court. Respondents\u2019 challenge to these criteria is not\nbefore us. We note, however, the Acting Solicitor General\u2019s statement\nat oral argument that \u201cNASA will not and does not use\u201d the document\nto which respondents object \u201cto make contractor credentialing deci\nsions.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.\n8                          NASA v.

This Court considered a similar\nclaim in Whalen, 429 U. S. 589, which concerned New\nYork\u2019s practice of collecting \u201cthe names and addresses of\nall persons\u201d prescribed dangerous drugs with both \u201clegiti\nmate and illegitimate uses.\u201d Id., at 591. In discussing\nthat claim, the Court said that \u201c[t]he cases sometimes\ncharacterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 \u201d actually involved \u201cat\nleast two different kinds of interests\u201d: one, an \u201cinterest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters\u201d;6 the other, an\ninterest in \u201cmaking certain kinds of important decisions\u201d\nfree from government interference.7 The patients who\nbrought suit in Whalen argued that New York\u2019s statute\n\u201cthreaten[ed] to impair\u201d both their \u201cnondisclosure\u201d inter\nests and their interests in making healthcare decisions\nindependently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld\nthe statute as a \u201creasonable exercise of New York\u2019s broad\npolice powers.\u201d Id., at 598.\n  Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d to the State was an \u201cunpleasant invasion of\nprivacy,\u201d id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the\nNew York statute contained \u201csecurity provisions\u201d that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 429 U.

This sort of \u201cstatutory or regulatory\nduty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d of \u201caccumulated\nprivate data\u201d was sufficient, in the Court\u2019s view, to protect\na privacy interest that \u201carguably ha[d] its roots in the\nConstitution.\u201d Id., at 605\u2013606. The Court thus concluded\nthat the statute did not violate \u201cany right or liberty pro\ntected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., at 606.\n   Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti\ntutional \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure.\u201d Nixon, 433\nU. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former\nPresident Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential\nRecordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,\nnote following 44 U. S. C. \u00a72111, a statute that required\nhim to turn over his presidential papers and tape re\ncordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at\n455\u2013465. In a section of the opinion entitled \u201cPrivacy,\u201d the\nCourt addressed a combination of claims that the review\nrequired by this Act violated the former President\u2019s\n\u201cFourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]\u201d rights. Id., at 455, and\nn. 18, 458\u2013459. The Court rejected those challenges after\nconcluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in\nWhalen, contained protections against \u201cundue dissemina\ntion of private materials.\u201d 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the\nCourt observed that the former President\u2019s claim was\n\u201cweaker\u201d than the one \u201cfound wanting . . . in Whalen,\u201d as\nthe Government was required to return immediately all\n\u201cpurely private papers and recordings\u201d identified by the\narchivists. Id., at 458\u2013459. Citing Fourth Amendment\nprecedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in\npreserving presidential papers outweighed any \u201clegitimate\nexpectation of privacy\u201d that the former President may\nhave enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389\nU. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry\n10                        NASA v.

Since then, the Court has\nsaid little else on the subject of an \u201cindividual interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201d Whalen, supra,\nat 599; Nixon, supra, at 457. A few opinions have men\ntioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 762\u2013763 (1989); New York v. Ferber,\n458 U. S. 747, 759, n. 10 (1982). But no other decision has\nsquarely addressed a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy.9\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Court continued its discussion of Fourth Amendment principles\n\nthroughout the \u201cPrivacy\u201d section of the opinion. See 433 U. S., at 459\n(citing United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435 (1976), United States v.\nDionisio, 410 U. S. 1 (1973), and Katz, 389 U. S. 347)); 433 U. S., at\n460\u2013462 (addressing the former President\u2019s claim that the Act was\n\u201ctantamount to a general warrant\u201d under Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.\n476 (1965)); 433 U. S., at 463\u2013465, and n. 26 (concluding that the\nchallenged law was analogous to the wiretapping provisions of Title III\nof the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, notwith\nstanding the lack of a \u201cwarrant requirement\u201d).\n   9 State and lower federal courts have offered a number of different\n\ninterpretations of Whalen and Nixon over the years. Many courts hold\nthat disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be\nsubject to a test that balances the government\u2019s interests against the\nindividual\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,\n712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel\nphia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v. Houston, 940 F. 2d\n134, 138 (CA5 1991) (per curiam); In re Crawford, 194 F. 3d 954, 959\n(CA9 1999); State v. Russo, 259 Conn. 436, 459\u2013464, 790 A. 2d 1132,\n1147\u20131150 (2002). The Sixth Circuit has held that the right to infor\nmational privacy protects only intrusions upon interests \u201cthat can be\ndeemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d J. P.\nv. DeSanti, 653 F. 2d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The D. C. Circuit has expressed \u201cgrave doubts\u201d about the\nexistence of a constitutional right to informational privacy. American\nFederation of Govt. Employees v.

S., at 599, 605.10 We hold, however,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The opinions concurring in the judgment disagree with this ap\n\nproach and would instead provide a definitive answer to the question\nwhether there is a constitutional right to informational privacy. Post,\nat 6\u20137 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). One of\nthese opinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will \u201char[m]\nour image, if not our self-respect,\u201d post, at 7 (SCALIA, J.), and will cause\npractical problems, post, at 8\u20139. There are sound reasons for eschewing\nthe concurring opinions\u2019 recommended course.\n   \u201cThe premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not\nsit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially\nas arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties\nbefore them.\u201d Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)\n(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask\nus to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,\nand respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from\naddressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a\nmatter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit\nof briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice\nthat the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (\u201cno need in\nthis case\u201d for broad decision on \u201cthe scope of a constitutionally-based\nright to privacy for certain information\u201d). Particularly in cases like this\none, where we have only the \u201cscarce and open-ended\u201d guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U.

When the Government asks respon\ndents and their references to fill out SF\u201385 and Form 42,\nit does not exercise its sovereign power \u201cto regulate or\nlicense.\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts\nthe challenged background checks in its capacity \u201cas pro\nprietor\u201d and manager of its \u201cinternal operation.\u201d Ibid.\nTime and again our cases have recognized that the Gov\nernment has a much freer hand in dealing \u201cwith citizen\nemployees than it does when it brings its sovereign power\nto bear on citizens at large.\u201d Engquist v.

And the particular investigations challenged in\nthis case arose from a decision to extend that requirement\nto federal contract employees requiring long-term access to\nfederal facilities. See HSPD\u201312, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS\nPUB 201\u20131, at iii\u2013vi, 1\u20138, App. 131\u2013150.\n  As this long history suggests, the Government has an\ninterest in conducting basic employment background\nchecks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em\nployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its\nfacilities and in employing a competent, reliable work\nforce. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599. Courts must keep\nthose interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line\nthrough the Government\u2019s employment forms and to\nscrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they\ncontain.\n  Respondents argue that, because they are contract\nemployees and not civil servants, the Government\u2019s broad\nauthority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin\nished force. But the Government\u2019s interest as \u201cproprietor\u201d\nin managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work\ners, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See\nBoard of Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U.

The fact that\nrespondents\u2019 direct employment relationship is with Cal\nTech\u2014which operates JPL under a Government con\ntract\u2014says very little about the interests at stake in this\ncase.

See NASA, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf.

The record indicates that this may be wrong as\na factual matter. E.g., 7 Record 391 (\u201cI have not been required to\nundergo any type of background investigation to maintain my position\nwith JPL\u201d); id., at 397 (\u201cI have never been required to undergo any type\nof background investigation to maintain my position with JPL other\nthan . . .

In any event, counsel abandoned this position at\noral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.\n16                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 2\n    With these interests in view, we conclude that the chal\nlenged portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42 consist of\nreasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the\nGovernment\u2019s interests in managing its internal opera\ntions. See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598\u2013599; Whalen, 429\nU. S., at 597\u2013598. As to SF\u201385, the only part of the form\nchallenged here is its request for information about \u201cany\ntreatment or counseling received\u201d for illegal-drug use\nwithin the previous year. The \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d\nquestion, however, must be considered in context. It is a\nfollowup to SF\u201385\u2019s inquiry into whether the employee has\n\u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\u201d\nduring the past year. The Government has good reason to\nask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like\nany employer, the Government is entitled to have its\nprojects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will\n\u201c \u2018efficiently and effectively\u2019 \u201d discharge their duties. See\nEngquist, supra, at 598\u2013599. Questions about illegal-drug\nuse are a useful way of figuring out which persons have\nthese characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An\nUpdated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in\nthe Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi\nronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated\nwith workplace productivity).\n    In context, the follow-up question on \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,\nemployment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz\ning that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical\nissue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who\nare taking steps to address and overcome their problems.\nThe Government thus uses responses to the \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d question as a mitigating factor in determining\nwhether to grant contract employees long-term access to\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal facilities.13\n   This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach,\nand respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the\nGovernment\u2019s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigat\ning factor in its contractor credentialing decisions. Re\nspondents\u2019 argument is that, if drug treatment is only\nused to mitigate, then the Government should change the\nmandatory phrasing of SF\u201385\u2014\u201cInclude [in your answer]\nany treatment or counseling received\u201d\u2014so as to make a\nresponse optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory\n\u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question is unconstitutional, in\nrespondents\u2019 view, because it is \u201cmore intrusive than\nnecessary to satisfy the government\u2019s objective.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that \u201ctreat\nment or counseling\u201d question should be enjoined because\nthe form \u201cappears to compel disclosure\u201d).\n   We reject the argument that the Government, when it\nrequests job-related personal information in an employ\nment background check, has a constitutional burden to\ndemonstrate that its questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a\nstandard runs directly contrary to Whalen. The patients\nin Whalen, much like respondents here, argued that New\nYork\u2019s statute was unconstitutional because the State\ncould not \u201cdemonstrate the necessity\u201d of its program. 429\nU. S., at 596. The Court quickly rejected that argument,\nconcluding that New York\u2019s collection of patients\u2019 prescrip\ntion information could \u201cnot be held unconstitutional sim\nply because\u201d a court viewed it as \u201cunnecessary, in whole or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern\n\nment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, \u201cdespite counseling and\nrehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita\ntion.\u201d 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the\nActing Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or\ncounseling solely as a \u201cmitigat[ing]\u201d factor that ameliorates concerns\nabout recent illegal drug use. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n18                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin part.\u201d Id., at 596\u2013597.\n  That analysis applies with even greater force where the\nGovernment acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager\nof its internal affairs. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599.\nSF\u201385\u2019s \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question reasonably\nseeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who\nare attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern\nment\u2019s considered position is that phrasing the question in\nmore permissive terms would result in a lower response\nrate, and the question\u2019s effectiveness in identifying illegal\ndrug users who are suitable for employment would be\n\u201cmaterially reduced.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That\nis a reasonable position, falling within the \u201c \u2018wide lati\ntude\u2019 \u201d granted the Government in its dealings with em\nployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.\n                              3\n  The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, \u201copen\nended questions\u201d on Form 42 likely violate respondents\u2019\ninformational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants\u2019\ndesignated references and landlords for \u201cinformation\u201d\nbearing on \u201csuitability for government employment or a\nsecurity clearance.\u201d App. 97. In a series of questions, the\nGovernment asks if the reference has any \u201cadverse infor\nmation\u201d about the applicant\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthi\nness,\u201d \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial integrity,\u201d \u201cabuse\nof alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional stability,\u201d\n\u201cgeneral behavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201d Ibid.\n  These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF\u201385, are reasonably aimed at identifying\ncapable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov\nernment\u2019s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599.\nAsking an applicant\u2019s designated references broad, open\nended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool\nfor separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would\nbe a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nperson might not be suitable for a particular job, and\nreferences do not have all day to answer a laundry list of\nspecific questions. See CDIA Brief 6\u20137 (references \u201ctypi\ncally have limited time to answer questions from potential\nemployers,\u201d and \u201copen-ended questions\u201d yield more rele\nvant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by\ncontrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.\n5359.\n   The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is\nillustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private\nsectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over\n1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of\nopen-ended questions in employment background checks\nappears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.\nSee, e.g., S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compli\nance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference\nChecks on Job Applicants (\u201cFollowing are the guidelines\nfor conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open\nended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer\u201d);\nM. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (\u201cAlso\nask, \u2018Is there anything else I need to know about [candi\ndate\u2019s name]?\u2019 This kind of open-ended question may turn\nup all kinds of information you wouldn\u2019t have gotten any\nother way\u201d). The use of similar open-ended questions by\nthe Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in\nmanaging its operations.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Not only are SF\u201385 and Form 42 reasonable in light of\nthe Government interests at stake, they are also subject to\nsubstantial protections against disclosure to the public.\nBoth Whalen and Nixon recognized that government\n\u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic pur\nposes\u201d may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457\u2013458, 462. But both deci\n20                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions also stated that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to\navoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d generally allays these\nprivacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at\n458\u2013459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York\u2019s\n\u201csecurity provisions\u201d prohibiting public disclosure, turned\naside a challenge to the collection of patients\u2019 prescription\ninformation. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600\u2013601, 605.\nIn Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even\n\u201cweaker\u201d claim by the former President because the Presi\ndential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act \u201c[n]ot\nonly . . . mandate[d] regulations\u201d against \u201cundue dissemi\nnation,\u201d but also required immediate return of any \u201cpurely\nprivate\u201d materials flagged by the Government\u2019s archivists.\n433 U. S., at 458\u2013459.\n  Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen\nand former President Nixon, attack only the Government\u2019s\ncollection of information on SF\u201385 and Form 42. And\nhere, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information\ncollected is shielded by statute from \u201cunwarranted disclo\nsur[e].\u201d See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,\nwhich covers all information collected during the back\nground-check process, allows the Government to maintain\nrecords \u201cabout an individual\u201d only to the extent the re\ncords are \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a pur\npose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(1). The Act\nrequires written consent before the Government may\ndisclose records pertaining to any individual. \u00a7552a(b).\nAnd the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations\nof its nondisclosure obligations. \u00a7552a(i)(1). These re\nquirements, as we have noted, give \u201cforceful recognition\u201d\nto a Government employee\u2019s interest in maintaining the\n\u201cconfidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person\nnel files.\u201d Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,\nn. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in\nWhalen and Nixon, they \u201cevidence a proper concern\u201d for\nindividual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 458\u2013459.\n                              2\n   Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue\nthat statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s disclosure\nbar, see \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(1)\u2013(12), leave its protections too porous\nto supply a meaningful check against \u201cunwarranted dis\nclosures,\u201d Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in\nparticular to what they describe as a \u201cbroad\u201d exception\nfor \u201croutine use[s],\u201d defined as uses that are \u201ccompatible\nwith the purpose for which the record was collected.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(3), (a)(7).\n   Respondents\u2019 reliance on these exceptions rests on an\nincorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of\nthe Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and\nNixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory\nprotections against \u201cunwarranted disclosures\u201d and \u201cundue\ndissemination\u201d of personal information collected by the\nGovernment. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.\nNeither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is\nneeded to satisfy privacy interests that may be \u201croot[ed] in\nthe Constitution.\u201d Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the\nNew York statute prohibiting \u201c[p]ublic disclosure of the\nidentity of patients\u201d was itself subject to several excep\ntions. 429 U. S., at 594\u2013595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the\nprotections against \u201cundue dissemination\u201d mentioned in\nthe opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be\nincluded in forthcoming regulations \u201cmandate[d]\u201d by the\nchallenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437\u2013439\n(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the\nAct\u2019s \u201cfacial validity\u201d and was not considering the Admin\nistrator\u2019s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact\nthat the Privacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement is sub\nject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides\ninsufficient protection against public disclosure.\n   Nor does the substance of the \u201croutine use\u201d exception\n22                      NASA v. NELSON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrelied on by respondents create any undue risk of public\ndissemination. None of the authorized \u201croutine use[s]\u201d of\nrespondents\u2019 background-check information allows for\nrelease to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859\u201345860, 45862\n(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.\nReg. 28307 (2010).       Rather, the established \u201croutine\nuse[s]\u201d consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to\ncomplete the background-check process in an efficient and\norderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving\ndisclosures to authorized New York Department of Health\nemployees that were not \u201cmeaningfully distinguishable\u201d\nfrom routine disclosures \u201cassociated with many facets of\nhealth care\u201d). One routine use, for example, involves a\nlimited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that\ndesignated references can \u201cidentify the individual\u201d at issue\nand can understand the \u201cnature and purpose of the inves\ntigation.\u201d App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review\neach completed SF\u201385 to verify that all requested infor\nmation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated\nJPL employees may not \u201cdisclose any information con\ntained in the form to anyone else,\u201d ibid., and Cal Tech is\nnot given access to adverse information uncovered during\nthe Government\u2019s background check, id., at 207\u2013208. The\n\u201cremote possibility\u201d of public disclosure created by these\nnarrow \u201croutine use[s]\u201d does not undermine the Privacy\nAct\u2019s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U.

But data\nbreaches are a possibility any time the Government stores\ninformation. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere\npossibility that security measures will fail provides no\n\u201cproper ground\u201d for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also\ncite a portion of SF\u201385 that warns of possible disclosure\n\u201c[t]o the news media or the general public.\u201d App. 89. By\nits terms, this exception allows public disclosure only\nwhere release is \u201cin the public interest\u201d and would not\nresult in \u201can unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\nIbid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a\ndisclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario\nin which their information might be unduly disclosed\nunder this exception.15\n   In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act\u2019s\nnondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged\nportions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an\nemployment background check, we conclude that the\nGovernment\u2019s inquiries do not violate a constitutional\nright to informational privacy.

Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.\nChao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in\nWhalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action\u2014for money\ndamages or injunctive relief\u2014is needed in order to provide sufficient\nprotection against public disclosure.\n24                 NASA v.

NELSON ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 19, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court, of course, that background\nchecks of employees of government contractors do not\noffend the Constitution. But rather than reach this con\nclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption\nthat the Constitution requires courts to \u201cbalance\u201d the\nGovernment\u2019s interests in data collection against its con\ntractor employees\u2019 interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler\ngrounds. Like many other desirable things not included\nin the Constitution, \u201cinformational privacy\u201d seems like a\ngood idea\u2014wherefore the People have enacted laws at the\nfederal level and in the states restricting the government\u2019s\ncollection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo\nple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they\nthink it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu\ntional right to \u201cinformational privacy\u201d does not exist.\n   Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I\nmust observe a remarkable and telling fact about this\ncase, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents\u2019\nbrief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the\nConstitution, does not once identify which provision of\nthe Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities\ncontains citations of cases from federal and state courts,\n2                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfederal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four\nstates, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even\nmore exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the\nGovernment Accountability Office and an EEOC document\nconcerning \u201cEnforcement Guidance.\u201d And yet it contains\nnot a single citation of the sole document we are called\nupon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.\nThe body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference\nto the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the\nassuredly inapposite Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558\n(2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is\nmade to argue that NASA\u2019s actions deprived respondents\nof liberty without due process of law. And this legal strat\negy was not limited to respondents\u2019 filing in this Court; in\nthe Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that\n\u201ccourts have grounded the right to informational privacy\nin various provisions of the Constitution,\u201d Brief for Appel\nlants in No. 07\u201356424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify\nwhich ones applied here.\n   To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly\nhonest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right\nout of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pre\ntense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Re\ngrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral\nargument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first\ntime in this litigation, that the right to informational\nprivacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201329. That counsel in\nvoked the infinitely plastic concept of \u201csubstantive\u201d due\nprocess does not make this constitutional theory any less\ninvented.\n   This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that\nthe Due Process Clause does not \u201cguarante[e] certain\n(unspecified) liberties\u201d; rather, it \u201cmerely guarantees\ncertain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of\nliberty.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that\nthe State has deprived them of liberty without the requi\nsite procedures, and their due process claim therefore\nmust fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for\nidentifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux\n\u201csubstantive\u201d component of the Due Process Clause\u2014that\n\u201cthe Due Process Clause specially protects those funda\nmental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720\u2013721 (1997) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014respondents\u2019 claim would fail.\nRespondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim\nat issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing\nthe farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply\nrooted in our history and tradition bars the Government\nfrom ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by\nrecovering drug addicts.\n   The absurdity of respondents\u2019 position in this case\nshould not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due\nprocess precedents, even our \u201csubstantive due process\u201d\nprecedents, do not support any right to informational\nprivacy. First, we have held that the government\u2019s act of\ndefamation does not deprive a person \u201cof any \u2018liberty\u2019\nprotected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\u201d Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976).\nWe reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not \u201csig\nnificantly alte[r]\u201d a person\u2019s legal status so as to \u201cjustif[y]\nthe invocation of procedural safeguards.\u201d Id., at 708\u2013709.\nIf outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable\nthat the mere disclosure of private information does.\n   Second, respondents challenge the Government\u2019s collec\ntion of their private information. But the Government\u2019s\ncollection of private information is regulated by the Fourth\nAmendment, and \u201c[w]here a particular Amendment pro\nvides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\nagainst a particular sort of government behavior, that\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment, not the more generalized notion of substan\ntive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these\nclaims.\u201d County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,\n842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration\nin original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents\u2019\nFourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the\nForm 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth\nAmendment \u201csearches\u201d under United States v. Miller, 425\nU. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does\nnot prohibit the Government from asking questions about\nprivate information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876\u2013877 (2008). That\nshould have been the end of the matter. Courts should not\nuse the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they\ndeem unsightly in the protections provided by other con\nstitutional provisions.\n   In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu\ntional right to \u201cinformational privacy.\u201d Besides being\nconsistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view\nhas the attractive benefit of resolving this case without\nresort to the Court\u2019s exegesis on the Government\u2019s legiti\nmate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and\nthe comfortingly narrow scope of NASA\u2019s \u201croutine use\u201d\nregulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further\nexplanation of the incoherence of the Court\u2019s \u201csubstantive\ndue process\u201d doctrine in its many manifestations, since the\nCourt does not play the substantive-due-process card.\nInstead, it states that it will \u201cassume, without deciding\u201d\nthat there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,\nat 1.\n   The Court\u2019s sole justification for its decision to \u201cassume,\nwithout deciding\u201d is that the Court made the same mis\ntake before\u2014in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589 (1977), and Nixon v. Administrator of General\nServices, 433 U. S. 425 (1977).* Ante, at 11.

Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cIt is the preferred course because it\npromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent\ndevelopment of legal principles.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, however, there is no applicable rule\nof law that is settled. To the contrary, Whalen and Nixon\ncreated an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution\ndid not contain and that today\u2019s opinion perpetuates.\n   A further reason Whalen and Nixon are not entitled to\nstare decisis effect is that neither opinion supplied any\ncoherent reason why a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy might exist. As supporting authority,\nWhalen cited Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557 (1969), a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfailure to address whether there is a right to informational privacy\ncannot be blamed upon the Government\u2019s concession that such a right\nexists, and indeed the Government\u2019s startling assertion that Whalen\nand Nixon (which decided nothing on the constitutional point, and have\nnot been so much as cited in our later opinions) were \u201cseminal\u201d\u2014\nseminal!\u2014decisions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. We are not bound\nby a litigant\u2019s concession on an issue of law. See, e.g., Grove City\nCollege v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 562, n. 10 (1984). And it should not be\nthought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self\ndenying act. To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitu\ntional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the\nPrivacy Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a (2006 ed. and Supp. III), already contains\nextensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional\nimprovisation. And because Congress\u2019s power under \u00a75 of the Four\nteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause,\nsee City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), the United States\nhas an incentive to give that Clause a broad reading, thus expanding\nthe scope of federal legislation that it justifies. Federal laws prevent\ning state disregard of \u201cinformational privacy\u201d may be a twinkle in the\nSolicitor General\u2019s eye.\n6                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nFirst Amendment case protecting private possession of\nobscenity; the deservedly infamous dictum in Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), concerning the \u201cpenum\nbra\u201d of the First Amendment; and three concurring or\ndissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated\nthat there might be such a thing as a substantive due\nprocess right to informational privacy. 429 U. S., at 599,\nn. 25. Nixon provided even less support. After citing the\nobservation in Whalen that \u201c[o]ne element of privacy has\nbeen characterized as the individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters,\u201d Nixon, supra, at 457\n(quoting Whalen, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward Fourth\nAmendment analysis. It \u201cassume[d]\u201d that there was a\n\u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the materials, and\nrejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the statute at issue\nwas \u201cprecisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amend\nment was intended to prevent.\u201d Nixon, supra, at 457\u2013458,\n460. It is unfathomable why these cases\u2019 passing, barely\nexplained reference to a right separate from the Fourth\nAmendment\u2014an unenumerated right that they held to be\nnot applicable\u2014should be afforded stare decisis weight.\n   At this point the reader may be wondering: \u201cWhat, after\nall, is the harm in being \u2018minimalist\u2019 and simply refusing\nto say that violation of a constitutional right of informa\ntional privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is\nthe same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypo\nthetical right was not violated.\u201d Well, there is harm. The\nCourt\u2019s never-say-never disposition does damage for sev\neral reasons.\n   1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.\nBy substituting for one real constitutional question\n(whether there exists a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy) a different constitutional question (whether\nNASA\u2019s background checks would contravene a right to\ninformational privacy if such a right existed), the Court\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its\nbusiness: the appropriate balance between security and\nprivacy. If I am correct that there exists no right to in\nformational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in\njudicial maximalism. Better simply to state and apply\nthe law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law in\npectore, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our\ncharter, and probably beyond our ken.\n  If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to\nsee the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion\nanalyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is\n\u201cassumed\u201d rather than \u201cdecided.\u201d Thirty-three years have\npassed since the Court first suggested that the right may,\nor may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon\nthis Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.\n  2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it\nmakes no sense. The Court decides that the Government\ndid not violate the right to informational privacy without\ndeciding whether there is a right to informational privacy,\nand without even describing what hypothetical standard\nshould be used to assess whether the hypothetical right\nhas been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to\nanother of the Court\u2019s never-say-never dispositions:\n    \u201c[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents\u2019] claim\n    fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\n    consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a hypothetical\n    standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is suf\n    ficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as\n    well acknowledge the right as well. Or [it] could avoid\n    the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical stan\n    dard by denying the right. But embracing a standard\n    while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and de\n    ciding this case while addressing neither the standard\n    nor the right is quite impossible.\u201d Stop the Beach Re\n8                      NASA v.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion)\n    (joined by ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 12\u201313).\nWhatever the virtues of judicial minimalism, it cannot\njustify judicial incoherence.\n   The Court defends its approach by observing that\n\u201cwe have only the \u2018scarce and open-ended\u2019 \u201d guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way.\u201d Ante, at 11,\nn. 10. I would have thought that this doctrinal obscurity\nshould lead us to provide more clarity for lower courts;\nsurely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for\nanother.\n   The Court observes that I have joined other opinions\nthat have assumed the existence of constitutional rights.\nIbid. It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitu\ntional questions, so long as answering those questions is\nunnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented\nin the case. So in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,\n497 U. S. 261, 279\u2013280 (1990), we declined to decide\nwhether a competent person had a constitutional right to\nrefuse lifesaving hydration, because\u2014under a constitu\ntional standard we laid out in detail\u2014such a right did not\nexist for an incompetent person. In Herrera v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 390, 417\u2013418 (1993), we declined to decide whether\nit would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent per\nson, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.\nIn New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,\n487 U. S. 1, 10\u201315 (1988), we declined to decide whether\nthere was a constitutional right of private association for\ncertain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial\nchallenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in\nmany of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide\nwhether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could\nsucceed. Here, however, the Court actually applies a\nconstitutional informational privacy standard without\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.\nConsider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant\nfactors alluded to in today\u2019s opinion:\n\u2022\t It is relevant that the Government is acting \u201cin its\n   capacity \u2018as proprietor\u2019 and manager of its \u2018internal op\n   eration.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are\n   told neither what the appropriate standard should be\n   when the Government is acting as regulator nor what\n   the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as\n   proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on\n   the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.\n\u2022\t History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at\n   13\u201314, but how much is uncertain. The Court points\n   out that the Federal Government has been conducting\n   investigations of candidates for employment since the\n   earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges\n   that extension of those investigations to employees of\n   contractors is of very recent vintage.\n\u2022\t The contract employees are doing important work.\n   They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they\n   are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at\n   15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today\u2019s case\n   would be different for background checks of lower-level\n   employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never\n   told.\n\u2022\t Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)\n   constitutional because they are \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cuseful,\u201d\n   and \u201chumane.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317 (internal quotation\n   marks omitted). And questions to third parties are\n   constitutional because they are \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cper\n   vasiv[e].\u201d Ante, at 18\u201319. Any or all of these adjectives\n   may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of\n   the hypothetical constitutional right to \u201cinformational\n   privacy\u201d is evaluated.\n10                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u2022\t The Court notes that a \u201c \u2018statutory or regulatory duty\n   to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u2019 generally allays\n   these privacy concerns,\u201d ante, at 20 (emphasis added),\n   but it gives no indication of what the exceptions to this\n   general rule might be. It then discusses the provisions\n   of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em\n   phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA\u2019s routine\n   use regulations. Ante, at 21\u201323. From the length of\n   the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec\n   essary to today\u2019s holding, but how much of it is neces\n   sary is a mystery.\n   4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits\nclaiming violations of the right to informational privacy.\nRare will be the claim that is supported by none of the\nfactors deemed relevant in today\u2019s opinion. Moreover, the\nutter silliness of respondents\u2019 position in this case leaves\nplenty of room for the possible success of future claims\nthat are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents\nclaim that even though they are Government contractor\nemployees, and even though they are working with highly\nexpensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov\nernment is seeking only information about drug treatment\nand information from third parties that is standard in\nbackground checks, and even though the Government is\nliable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and\neven though NASA\u2019s Privacy Act regulations are very\nprotective of private information, NASA\u2019s background\nchecks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully\nciting all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the\nCourt makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.\n   In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 in those\ncircuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a\nconstitutional right to \u201cinformational privacy,\u201d lawyers\nwill always (and I mean always) find some way around\ntoday\u2019s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant\nwill be liable not only for damages but also for attorney\u2019s\nfees under \u00a71988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue,\nand defendants\u2014for whom no safe harbor can be found in\nthe many words of today\u2019s opinion\u2014to settle.

Argued October 5, 2010\u2014Decided January 19, 2011\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a\n  workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract em\n  ployees. Respondents are contract employees at NASA\u2019s Jet Propul\n  sion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute\n  of Technology (Cal Tech). Respondents were not subject to Govern\n  ment background checks at the time they were hired, but that\n  changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identifi\n  cation standards for both federal civil servants and contractor em\n  ployees. The Department of Commerce mandated that contract em\n  ployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard\n  background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquir\n  ies (NACI), by October 2007. NASA modified its contract with Cal\n  Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that em\n  ployees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be de\n  nied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.\n    The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins\n  with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form\n  85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF\u201385)). SF\u201385\n  asks whether an employee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manu\n  factured illegal drugs\u201d in the last year. If so, the employee must pro\n  vide details, including information about \u201ctreatment or counseling re\n  ceived.\u201d The employee must also sign a release authorizing the\n  Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers,\n  and others during its investigation. Once SF\u201385 is completed, the\n  Government sends the employee\u2019s references a questionnaire (Form\n  42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have \u201cany\n  reason to question\u201d the employee\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthiness,\u201d or\n2                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have \u201cadverse information\u201d concerning a variety of other matters. All\n    SF\u201385 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the\n    Privacy Act.\n       With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near,\n    respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the back\n    ground-check process violates a constitutional right to informational\n    privacy. The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunc\n    tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that SF\u201385\u2019s inquiries\n    into recent drug involvement furthered the Government\u2019s interest in\n    combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug \u201ctreatment or counsel\n    ing\u201d question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to\n    be held unconstitutional. It also held that Form 42\u2019s open-ended\n    questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government\u2019s inter\n    ests in verifying contractors\u2019 identities and ensuring JPL\u2019s security,\n    and thus also likely violated respondents\u2019 informational-privacy\n    rights.\nHeld:\n    1. In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred\n broadly to a constitutional privacy \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure of\n personal matters.\u201d Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600; Nixon v.\n Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457. In Whalen, the\n Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and\n addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the\n statute\u2019s \u201csecurity provisions,\u201d which protected against \u201cpublic disclo\n sure\u201d of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600\u2013601, were sufficient to\n protect a privacy interest \u201carguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,\u201d\n id., at 605. In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former\n President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for\n archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at is\n sue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against \u201cundue dis\n semination of private materials.\u201d 433 U. S, at 458. Since Nixon, the\n Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to in\n formational privacy. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    2. Assuming, without deciding, that the Government\u2019s challenged\n inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance,\n that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government\n from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF\u201385 and\n Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject\n to the Privacy Act\u2019s safeguards against public disclosure. Pp. 10\u201324.\n       (a) The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests\n at stake. Pp. 11\u201319.\n         (1) Judicial review of the forms must take into account the con\n text in which the Government\u2019s challenged inquiries arise. When the\n Government acts in its capacity \u201cas proprietor\u201d and manager of its\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n\u201cinternal operation,\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to\ncitizens generally. The questions respondents challenge are part of a\nstandard background check of the sort used by millions of private\nemployers. The Government has been conducting employment inves\ntigations since the Republic\u2019s earliest days, and the President has\nhad statutory authority to assess an applicant\u2019s fitness for the civil\nservice since 1871. Standard background investigations similar to\nthose at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates\nin 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision\nto extend that requirement to federal contract employees. This his\ntory shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and\nto employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people\u2019s\nbusiness. The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents\nare contract employees. There are no meaningful distinctions in the\nduties of NASA\u2019s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at\nJPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA\u2019s\nmission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer in\nvestment. Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (2) The challenged questions on SF\u201385 and Form 42 are rea\nsonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government\u2019s\ninterests in managing its internal operations. SF\u201385\u2019s \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry\nabout illegal-drug use. In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also\na reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recog\nnizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue,\nseeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to ad\ndress and overcome their problems. Thus, it uses responses to the\ndrug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor cre\ndentialing decisions. The Court rejects the argument that the Gov\nernment has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its em\nployment background questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard\nruns directly contrary to Whalen. See 429 U. S., at 596\u2013597. Pp. 16\u2013\n18.\n       (3) Like SF\u201385\u2019s drug-treatment question, Form 42\u2019s open\nended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employ\nees who will faithfully conduct the Government\u2019s business. Asking\nan applicant\u2019s designated references broad questions about job suit\nability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from\nweak ones. The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by\ntheir pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     (b) In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government in\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    terests at stake, SF\u201385 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial\n    protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec\n    ognized that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted\n    disclosures\u201d generally allays privacy concerns created by government\n    \u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic purposes.\u201d\n    Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government\u2019s\n    collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in\n    formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo\n    sure. The Privacy Act\u2014which allows the Government to maintain\n    only those records \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a purpose\n    authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(1); requires written consent be\n    fore the Government may disclose an individual\u2019s records, \u00a7552a(b);\n    and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo\n    sure obligations, \u00a7552a(i)(1)\u2014\u201cevidence[s] a proper concern\u201d for indi\n    vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458\u2013459.\n    Respondents\u2019 claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s\n    disclosure bar, see \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(1)\u2013(12), leave its protections too porous\n    to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But\n    that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and\n    the Privacy Act.

Roe,\n429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents\nin this case, federal contract employees at a Government\nlaboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment\nbackground investigation violate their rights under\nWhalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a\nform questionnaire that asks employees about treatment\nor counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object\nto certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ\nees\u2019 designated references.\n   We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution\nprotects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen\nand Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por\ntions of the Government\u2019s background check do not violate\nthis right in the present case.

While many of these workers are\nfederal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed\ndirectly by Government contractors. Contract employees\nplay an important role in NASA\u2019s mission, and their du\nties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil\nservants.\n   One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\nin Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract\nemployees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute\nof Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a\nGovernment contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for\ndeep-space robotics and communications. Most of this\ncountry\u2019s unmanned space missions\u2014from the Explorer 1\nsatellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today\u2014have been\ndeveloped and run by JPL.

At the time when respondents were\nhired, background checks were standard only for federal\ncivil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936\n(1949\u20131953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con\ntracts required background checks for the employees of\nfederal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.\n   The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate\nthis two-track approach to background investigations.\nIn 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission\nprompted the President to order new, uniform identifica\ntion standards for \u201c[f]ederal employees,\u201d including \u201ccon\ntractor employees.\u201d       Homeland Security Presidential\nDirective/HSPD\u201312\u2014Policy for a Common Identification\nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public\nPapers of the President, George W.

App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara\ntory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents\u2019\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit\ngranted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713\n(2007), and later reversed the District Court\u2019s order. The\ncourt held that portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42 are\nlikely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en\njoined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d\n865 (2008).\n   Turning first to SF\u201385, the Court of Appeals noted\nrespondents\u2019 concession \u201cthat most of the questions\u201d on the\nform are \u201cunproblematic\u201d and do not \u201cimplicate the consti\ntutional right to informational privacy.\u201d 530 F. 3d, at 878.\nBut the court determined that the \u201cgroup of questions\nconcerning illegal drugs\u201d required closer scrutiny. Ibid.\nApplying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF\u201385\u2019s\ninquiries into recent involvement with drugs as \u201cnecessary\nto further the government\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d in combat\ning illegal-drug use. Id., at 879. The court went on to\nhold, however, that the portion of the form requiring\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Respondents sought to represent a class of \u201cJPL employees in non\n\nsensitive positions.\u201d App. 79. No class has been certified.\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndisclosure of drug \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d furthered no\nlegitimate interest and was thus likely to be held uncon\nstitutional. Ibid.\n   Form 42, in the Court of Appeals\u2019 estimation, was even\n\u201cmore problematic.\u201d Ibid. The form\u2019s \u201copen-ended and\nhighly private\u201d questions, the court concluded, were not\n\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet the Government\u2019s interests in\nverifying contractors\u2019 identities and \u201censuring the security\nof the JPL.\u201d Id., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held,\nthese \u201copen-ended\u201d questions, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF\u201385, likely violate respondents\u2019 informa\ntional-privacy rights.5\n   Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc. 568 F. 3d 1028 (2009). We\ngranted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also challenged the criteria that\n\nthey believe the Government will use to determine their \u201csuitability\u201d\nfor employment at JPL. Respondents relied on a document, which had\nbeen temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur\nportedly bearing on suitability for federal employment. App. 98\u2013104.\nAmong the listed factors were a failure to \u201cmee[t] financial obligations,\u201d\n\u201chealth issues,\u201d and \u201cmental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric\nissues.\u201d Id., at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under the\nheading \u201cCriminal or Immoral Conduct,\u201d included \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d\n\u201cvoyeurism,\u201d \u201cindecent proposal[s],\u201d and \u201ccarnal knowledge.\u201d Id., at 98.\nThe document also stated that while \u201chomosexuality,\u201d \u201cadultery,\u201d and\n\u201cillegitimate children\u201d were not \u201csuitability\u201d issues in and of them\nselves, they might pose \u201csecurity issue[s]\u201d if circumstances indicated a\n\u201csusceptibility to coercion or blackmail.\u201d Id., at 102. The Court of\nAppeals rejected respondents\u2019 \u201cchallenges to . . . suitability determina\ntion[s]\u201d as unripe. 530 F. 3d, at 873. Although respondents did not file\na cross-petition from that portion of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment, they\nnonetheless discuss these suitability criteria at some length in their\nbrief before this Court. Respondents\u2019 challenge to these criteria is not\nbefore us. We note, however, the Acting Solicitor General\u2019s statement\nat oral argument that \u201cNASA will not and does not use\u201d the document\nto which respondents object \u201cto make contractor credentialing deci\nsions.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.\n8                          NASA v.

This Court considered a similar\nclaim in Whalen, 429 U. S. 589, which concerned New\nYork\u2019s practice of collecting \u201cthe names and addresses of\nall persons\u201d prescribed dangerous drugs with both \u201clegiti\nmate and illegitimate uses.\u201d Id., at 591. In discussing\nthat claim, the Court said that \u201c[t]he cases sometimes\ncharacterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 \u201d actually involved \u201cat\nleast two different kinds of interests\u201d: one, an \u201cinterest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters\u201d;6 the other, an\ninterest in \u201cmaking certain kinds of important decisions\u201d\nfree from government interference.7 The patients who\nbrought suit in Whalen argued that New York\u2019s statute\n\u201cthreaten[ed] to impair\u201d both their \u201cnondisclosure\u201d inter\nests and their interests in making healthcare decisions\nindependently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld\nthe statute as a \u201creasonable exercise of New York\u2019s broad\npolice powers.\u201d Id., at 598.\n  Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d to the State was an \u201cunpleasant invasion of\nprivacy,\u201d id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the\nNew York statute contained \u201csecurity provisions\u201d that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 429 U.

This sort of \u201cstatutory or regulatory\nduty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d of \u201caccumulated\nprivate data\u201d was sufficient, in the Court\u2019s view, to protect\na privacy interest that \u201carguably ha[d] its roots in the\nConstitution.\u201d Id., at 605\u2013606. The Court thus concluded\nthat the statute did not violate \u201cany right or liberty pro\ntected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., at 606.\n   Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti\ntutional \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure.\u201d Nixon, 433\nU. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former\nPresident Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential\nRecordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,\nnote following 44 U. S. C. \u00a72111, a statute that required\nhim to turn over his presidential papers and tape re\ncordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at\n455\u2013465. In a section of the opinion entitled \u201cPrivacy,\u201d the\nCourt addressed a combination of claims that the review\nrequired by this Act violated the former President\u2019s\n\u201cFourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]\u201d rights. Id., at 455, and\nn. 18, 458\u2013459. The Court rejected those challenges after\nconcluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in\nWhalen, contained protections against \u201cundue dissemina\ntion of private materials.\u201d 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the\nCourt observed that the former President\u2019s claim was\n\u201cweaker\u201d than the one \u201cfound wanting . . . in Whalen,\u201d as\nthe Government was required to return immediately all\n\u201cpurely private papers and recordings\u201d identified by the\narchivists. Id., at 458\u2013459. Citing Fourth Amendment\nprecedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in\npreserving presidential papers outweighed any \u201clegitimate\nexpectation of privacy\u201d that the former President may\nhave enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389\nU. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry\n10                        NASA v.

Since then, the Court has\nsaid little else on the subject of an \u201cindividual interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201d Whalen, supra,\nat 599; Nixon, supra, at 457. A few opinions have men\ntioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 762\u2013763 (1989); New York v. Ferber,\n458 U. S. 747, 759, n. 10 (1982). But no other decision has\nsquarely addressed a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy.9\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Court continued its discussion of Fourth Amendment principles\n\nthroughout the \u201cPrivacy\u201d section of the opinion. See 433 U. S., at 459\n(citing United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435 (1976), United States v.\nDionisio, 410 U. S. 1 (1973), and Katz, 389 U. S. 347)); 433 U. S., at\n460\u2013462 (addressing the former President\u2019s claim that the Act was\n\u201ctantamount to a general warrant\u201d under Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.\n476 (1965)); 433 U. S., at 463\u2013465, and n. 26 (concluding that the\nchallenged law was analogous to the wiretapping provisions of Title III\nof the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, notwith\nstanding the lack of a \u201cwarrant requirement\u201d).\n   9 State and lower federal courts have offered a number of different\n\ninterpretations of Whalen and Nixon over the years. Many courts hold\nthat disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be\nsubject to a test that balances the government\u2019s interests against the\nindividual\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,\n712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel\nphia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v. Houston, 940 F. 2d\n134, 138 (CA5 1991) (per curiam); In re Crawford, 194 F. 3d 954, 959\n(CA9 1999); State v.

The Sixth Circuit has held that the right to infor\nmational privacy protects only intrusions upon interests \u201cthat can be\ndeemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d J. P.\nv. DeSanti, 653 F. 2d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The D. C.

S., at 599, 605.10 We hold, however,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The opinions concurring in the judgment disagree with this ap\n\nproach and would instead provide a definitive answer to the question\nwhether there is a constitutional right to informational privacy. Post,\nat 6\u20137 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).

There are sound reasons for eschewing\nthe concurring opinions\u2019 recommended course.\n   \u201cThe premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not\nsit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially\nas arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties\nbefore them.\u201d Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)\n(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask\nus to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,\nand respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from\naddressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a\nmatter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit\nof briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice\nthat the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (\u201cno need in\nthis case\u201d for broad decision on \u201cthe scope of a constitutionally-based\nright to privacy for certain information\u201d). Particularly in cases like this\none, where we have only the \u201cscarce and open-ended\u201d guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U.

When the Government asks respon\ndents and their references to fill out SF\u201385 and Form 42,\nit does not exercise its sovereign power \u201cto regulate or\nlicense.\u201d Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts\nthe challenged background checks in its capacity \u201cas pro\nprietor\u201d and manager of its \u201cinternal operation.\u201d Ibid.\nTime and again our cases have recognized that the Gov\nernment has a much freer hand in dealing \u201cwith citizen\nemployees than it does when it brings its sovereign power\nto bear on citizens at large.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of\nAgriculture, 553 U. S. 591, 598 (2008); Waters v. Churchill,\n511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion).

And the particular investigations challenged in\nthis case arose from a decision to extend that requirement\nto federal contract employees requiring long-term access to\nfederal facilities. See HSPD\u201312, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS\nPUB 201\u20131, at iii\u2013vi, 1\u20138, App. 131\u2013150.\n  As this long history suggests, the Government has an\ninterest in conducting basic employment background\nchecks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em\nployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its\nfacilities and in employing a competent, reliable work\nforce. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599. Courts must keep\nthose interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line\nthrough the Government\u2019s employment forms and to\nscrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they\ncontain.\n  Respondents argue that, because they are contract\nemployees and not civil servants, the Government\u2019s broad\nauthority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin\nished force. But the Government\u2019s interest as \u201cproprietor\u201d\nin managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work\ners, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See\nBoard of Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U.

The fact that\nrespondents\u2019 direct employment relationship is with Cal\nTech\u2014which operates JPL under a Government con\ntract\u2014says very little about the interests at stake in this\ncase.

See NASA, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The\nGovernment has a strong interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks into the contract employees minding\nthe store at JPL.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 In their brief, respondents also rely on the fact that many of them\n\nhave been working at JPL for years and that Cal Tech previously\nvetted them through standard \u201cemployment reference checks.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 52\u201353. The record indicates that this may be wrong as\na factual matter. E.g., 7 Record 391 (\u201cI have not been required to\nundergo any type of background investigation to maintain my position\nwith JPL\u201d); id., at 397 (\u201cI have never been required to undergo any type\nof background investigation to maintain my position with JPL other\nthan . . .

In any event, counsel abandoned this position at\noral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.\n16                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 2\n    With these interests in view, we conclude that the chal\nlenged portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42 consist of\nreasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the\nGovernment\u2019s interests in managing its internal opera\ntions. See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598\u2013599; Whalen, 429\nU. S., at 597\u2013598. As to SF\u201385, the only part of the form\nchallenged here is its request for information about \u201cany\ntreatment or counseling received\u201d for illegal-drug use\nwithin the previous year. The \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d\nquestion, however, must be considered in context. It is a\nfollowup to SF\u201385\u2019s inquiry into whether the employee has\n\u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\u201d\nduring the past year. The Government has good reason to\nask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like\nany employer, the Government is entitled to have its\nprojects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will\n\u201c \u2018efficiently and effectively\u2019 \u201d discharge their duties. See\nEngquist, supra, at 598\u2013599. Questions about illegal-drug\nuse are a useful way of figuring out which persons have\nthese characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An\nUpdated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in\nthe Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi\nronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated\nwith workplace productivity).\n    In context, the follow-up question on \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,\nemployment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz\ning that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical\nissue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who\nare taking steps to address and overcome their problems.\nThe Government thus uses responses to the \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d question as a mitigating factor in determining\nwhether to grant contract employees long-term access to\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal facilities.13\n   This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach,\nand respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the\nGovernment\u2019s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigat\ning factor in its contractor credentialing decisions. Re\nspondents\u2019 argument is that, if drug treatment is only\nused to mitigate, then the Government should change the\nmandatory phrasing of SF\u201385\u2014\u201cInclude [in your answer]\nany treatment or counseling received\u201d\u2014so as to make a\nresponse optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory\n\u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question is unconstitutional, in\nrespondents\u2019 view, because it is \u201cmore intrusive than\nnecessary to satisfy the government\u2019s objective.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that \u201ctreat\nment or counseling\u201d question should be enjoined because\nthe form \u201cappears to compel disclosure\u201d).\n   We reject the argument that the Government, when it\nrequests job-related personal information in an employ\nment background check, has a constitutional burden to\ndemonstrate that its questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a\nstandard runs directly contrary to Whalen. The patients\nin Whalen, much like respondents here, argued that New\nYork\u2019s statute was unconstitutional because the State\ncould not \u201cdemonstrate the necessity\u201d of its program. 429\nU. S., at 596. The Court quickly rejected that argument,\nconcluding that New York\u2019s collection of patients\u2019 prescrip\ntion information could \u201cnot be held unconstitutional sim\nply because\u201d a court viewed it as \u201cunnecessary, in whole or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern\n\nment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, \u201cdespite counseling and\nrehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita\ntion.\u201d 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the\nActing Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or\ncounseling solely as a \u201cmitigat[ing]\u201d factor that ameliorates concerns\nabout recent illegal drug use. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n18                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin part.\u201d Id., at 596\u2013597.\n  That analysis applies with even greater force where the\nGovernment acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager\nof its internal affairs. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599.\nSF\u201385\u2019s \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question reasonably\nseeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who\nare attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern\nment\u2019s considered position is that phrasing the question in\nmore permissive terms would result in a lower response\nrate, and the question\u2019s effectiveness in identifying illegal\ndrug users who are suitable for employment would be\n\u201cmaterially reduced.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That\nis a reasonable position, falling within the \u201c \u2018wide lati\ntude\u2019 \u201d granted the Government in its dealings with em\nployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.\n                              3\n  The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, \u201copen\nended questions\u201d on Form 42 likely violate respondents\u2019\ninformational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants\u2019\ndesignated references and landlords for \u201cinformation\u201d\nbearing on \u201csuitability for government employment or a\nsecurity clearance.\u201d App. 97. In a series of questions, the\nGovernment asks if the reference has any \u201cadverse infor\nmation\u201d about the applicant\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthi\nness,\u201d \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial integrity,\u201d \u201cabuse\nof alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional stability,\u201d\n\u201cgeneral behavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201d Ibid.\n  These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF\u201385, are reasonably aimed at identifying\ncapable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov\nernment\u2019s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598\u2013599.\nAsking an applicant\u2019s designated references broad, open\nended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool\nfor separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would\nbe a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nperson might not be suitable for a particular job, and\nreferences do not have all day to answer a laundry list of\nspecific questions. See CDIA Brief 6\u20137 (references \u201ctypi\ncally have limited time to answer questions from potential\nemployers,\u201d and \u201copen-ended questions\u201d yield more rele\nvant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by\ncontrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.\n5359.\n   The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is\nillustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private\nsectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over\n1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of\nopen-ended questions in employment background checks\nappears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.\nSee, e.g., S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compli\nance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference\nChecks on Job Applicants (\u201cFollowing are the guidelines\nfor conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open\nended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer\u201d);\nM. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (\u201cAlso\nask, \u2018Is there anything else I need to know about [candi\ndate\u2019s name]?\u2019 This kind of open-ended question may turn\nup all kinds of information you wouldn\u2019t have gotten any\nother way\u201d). The use of similar open-ended questions by\nthe Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in\nmanaging its operations.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Not only are SF\u201385 and Form 42 reasonable in light of\nthe Government interests at stake, they are also subject to\nsubstantial protections against disclosure to the public.\nBoth Whalen and Nixon recognized that government\n\u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic pur\nposes\u201d may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457\u2013458, 462. But both deci\n20                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions also stated that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to\navoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d generally allays these\nprivacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at\n458\u2013459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York\u2019s\n\u201csecurity provisions\u201d prohibiting public disclosure, turned\naside a challenge to the collection of patients\u2019 prescription\ninformation. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600\u2013601, 605.\nIn Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even\n\u201cweaker\u201d claim by the former President because the Presi\ndential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act \u201c[n]ot\nonly . . . mandate[d] regulations\u201d against \u201cundue dissemi\nnation,\u201d but also required immediate return of any \u201cpurely\nprivate\u201d materials flagged by the Government\u2019s archivists.\n433 U. S., at 458\u2013459.\n  Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen\nand former President Nixon, attack only the Government\u2019s\ncollection of information on SF\u201385 and Form 42. And\nhere, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information\ncollected is shielded by statute from \u201cunwarranted disclo\nsur[e].\u201d See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,\nwhich covers all information collected during the back\nground-check process, allows the Government to maintain\nrecords \u201cabout an individual\u201d only to the extent the re\ncords are \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a pur\npose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(1). The Act\nrequires written consent before the Government may\ndisclose records pertaining to any individual. \u00a7552a(b).\nAnd the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations\nof its nondisclosure obligations. \u00a7552a(i)(1). These re\nquirements, as we have noted, give \u201cforceful recognition\u201d\nto a Government employee\u2019s interest in maintaining the\n\u201cconfidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person\nnel files.\u201d Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,\nn. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in\nWhalen and Nixon, they \u201cevidence a proper concern\u201d for\nindividual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 458\u2013459.\n                              2\n   Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue\nthat statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s disclosure\nbar, see \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(1)\u2013(12), leave its protections too porous\nto supply a meaningful check against \u201cunwarranted dis\nclosures,\u201d Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in\nparticular to what they describe as a \u201cbroad\u201d exception\nfor \u201croutine use[s],\u201d defined as uses that are \u201ccompatible\nwith the purpose for which the record was collected.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(3), (a)(7).\n   Respondents\u2019 reliance on these exceptions rests on an\nincorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of\nthe Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and\nNixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory\nprotections against \u201cunwarranted disclosures\u201d and \u201cundue\ndissemination\u201d of personal information collected by the\nGovernment. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.\nNeither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is\nneeded to satisfy privacy interests that may be \u201croot[ed] in\nthe Constitution.\u201d Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the\nNew York statute prohibiting \u201c[p]ublic disclosure of the\nidentity of patients\u201d was itself subject to several excep\ntions. 429 U. S., at 594\u2013595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the\nprotections against \u201cundue dissemination\u201d mentioned in\nthe opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be\nincluded in forthcoming regulations \u201cmandate[d]\u201d by the\nchallenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437\u2013439\n(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the\nAct\u2019s \u201cfacial validity\u201d and was not considering the Admin\nistrator\u2019s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact\nthat the Privacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement is sub\nject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides\ninsufficient protection against public disclosure.\n   Nor does the substance of the \u201croutine use\u201d exception\n22                      NASA v. NELSON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrelied on by respondents create any undue risk of public\ndissemination. None of the authorized \u201croutine use[s]\u201d of\nrespondents\u2019 background-check information allows for\nrelease to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859\u201345860, 45862\n(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.\nReg. 28307 (2010).       Rather, the established \u201croutine\nuse[s]\u201d consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to\ncomplete the background-check process in an efficient and\norderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving\ndisclosures to authorized New York Department of Health\nemployees that were not \u201cmeaningfully distinguishable\u201d\nfrom routine disclosures \u201cassociated with many facets of\nhealth care\u201d). One routine use, for example, involves a\nlimited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that\ndesignated references can \u201cidentify the individual\u201d at issue\nand can understand the \u201cnature and purpose of the inves\ntigation.\u201d App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review\neach completed SF\u201385 to verify that all requested infor\nmation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated\nJPL employees may not \u201cdisclose any information con\ntained in the form to anyone else,\u201d ibid., and Cal Tech is\nnot given access to adverse information uncovered during\nthe Government\u2019s background check, id., at 207\u2013208. The\n\u201cremote possibility\u201d of public disclosure created by these\nnarrow \u201croutine use[s]\u201d does not undermine the Privacy\nAct\u2019s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U.

But data\nbreaches are a possibility any time the Government stores\ninformation. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere\npossibility that security measures will fail provides no\n\u201cproper ground\u201d for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also\ncite a portion of SF\u201385 that warns of possible disclosure\n\u201c[t]o the news media or the general public.\u201d App. 89. By\nits terms, this exception allows public disclosure only\nwhere release is \u201cin the public interest\u201d and would not\nresult in \u201can unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\nIbid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a\ndisclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario\nin which their information might be unduly disclosed\nunder this exception.15\n   In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act\u2019s\nnondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged\nportions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an\nemployment background check, we conclude that the\nGovernment\u2019s inquiries do not violate a constitutional\nright to informational privacy.

Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.\nChao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in\nWhalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action\u2014for money\ndamages or injunctive relief\u2014is needed in order to provide sufficient\nprotection against public disclosure.\n24                 NASA v.

NELSON ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 19, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court, of course, that background\nchecks of employees of government contractors do not\noffend the Constitution. But rather than reach this con\nclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption\nthat the Constitution requires courts to \u201cbalance\u201d the\nGovernment\u2019s interests in data collection against its con\ntractor employees\u2019 interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler\ngrounds. Like many other desirable things not included\nin the Constitution, \u201cinformational privacy\u201d seems like a\ngood idea\u2014wherefore the People have enacted laws at the\nfederal level and in the states restricting the government\u2019s\ncollection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo\nple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they\nthink it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu\ntional right to \u201cinformational privacy\u201d does not exist.\n   Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I\nmust observe a remarkable and telling fact about this\ncase, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents\u2019\nbrief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the\nConstitution, does not once identify which provision of\nthe Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities\ncontains citations of cases from federal and state courts,\n2                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfederal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four\nstates, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even\nmore exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the\nGovernment Accountability Office and an EEOC document\nconcerning \u201cEnforcement Guidance.\u201d And yet it contains\nnot a single citation of the sole document we are called\nupon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.\nThe body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference\nto the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the\nassuredly inapposite Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558\n(2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is\nmade to argue that NASA\u2019s actions deprived respondents\nof liberty without due process of law. And this legal strat\negy was not limited to respondents\u2019 filing in this Court; in\nthe Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that\n\u201ccourts have grounded the right to informational privacy\nin various provisions of the Constitution,\u201d Brief for Appel\nlants in No. 07\u201356424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify\nwhich ones applied here.\n   To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly\nhonest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right\nout of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pre\ntense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Re\ngrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral\nargument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first\ntime in this litigation, that the right to informational\nprivacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201329. That counsel in\nvoked the infinitely plastic concept of \u201csubstantive\u201d due\nprocess does not make this constitutional theory any less\ninvented.\n   This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that\nthe Due Process Clause does not \u201cguarante[e] certain\n(unspecified) liberties\u201d; rather, it \u201cmerely guarantees\ncertain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of\nliberty.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that\nthe State has deprived them of liberty without the requi\nsite procedures, and their due process claim therefore\nmust fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for\nidentifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux\n\u201csubstantive\u201d component of the Due Process Clause\u2014that\n\u201cthe Due Process Clause specially protects those funda\nmental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply\nrooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720\u2013721 (1997) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014respondents\u2019 claim would fail.\nRespondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim\nat issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing\nthe farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply\nrooted in our history and tradition bars the Government\nfrom ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by\nrecovering drug addicts.\n   The absurdity of respondents\u2019 position in this case\nshould not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due\nprocess precedents, even our \u201csubstantive due process\u201d\nprecedents, do not support any right to informational\nprivacy. First, we have held that the government\u2019s act of\ndefamation does not deprive a person \u201cof any \u2018liberty\u2019\nprotected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\u201d Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976).\nWe reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not \u201csig\nnificantly alte[r]\u201d a person\u2019s legal status so as to \u201cjustif[y]\nthe invocation of procedural safeguards.\u201d Id., at 708\u2013709.\nIf outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable\nthat the mere disclosure of private information does.\n   Second, respondents challenge the Government\u2019s collec\ntion of their private information. But the Government\u2019s\ncollection of private information is regulated by the Fourth\nAmendment, and \u201c[w]here a particular Amendment pro\nvides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\nagainst a particular sort of government behavior, that\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment, not the more generalized notion of substan\ntive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these\nclaims.\u201d County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,\n842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration\nin original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents\u2019\nFourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the\nForm 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth\nAmendment \u201csearches\u201d under United States v. Miller, 425\nU. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does\nnot prohibit the Government from asking questions about\nprivate information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876\u2013877 (2008). That\nshould have been the end of the matter. Courts should not\nuse the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they\ndeem unsightly in the protections provided by other con\nstitutional provisions.\n   In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu\ntional right to \u201cinformational privacy.\u201d Besides being\nconsistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view\nhas the attractive benefit of resolving this case without\nresort to the Court\u2019s exegesis on the Government\u2019s legiti\nmate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and\nthe comfortingly narrow scope of NASA\u2019s \u201croutine use\u201d\nregulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further\nexplanation of the incoherence of the Court\u2019s \u201csubstantive\ndue process\u201d doctrine in its many manifestations, since the\nCourt does not play the substantive-due-process card.\nInstead, it states that it will \u201cassume, without deciding\u201d\nthat there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,\nat 1.\n   The Court\u2019s sole justification for its decision to \u201cassume,\nwithout deciding\u201d is that the Court made the same mis\ntake before\u2014in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589 (1977), and Nixon v. Administrator of General\nServices, 433 U. S. 425 (1977).* Ante, at 11.

Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cIt is the preferred course because it\npromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent\ndevelopment of legal principles.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, however, there is no applicable rule\nof law that is settled. To the contrary, Whalen and Nixon\ncreated an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution\ndid not contain and that today\u2019s opinion perpetuates.\n   A further reason Whalen and Nixon are not entitled to\nstare decisis effect is that neither opinion supplied any\ncoherent reason why a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy might exist. As supporting authority,\nWhalen cited Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557 (1969), a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfailure to address whether there is a right to informational privacy\ncannot be blamed upon the Government\u2019s concession that such a right\nexists, and indeed the Government\u2019s startling assertion that Whalen\nand Nixon (which decided nothing on the constitutional point, and have\nnot been so much as cited in our later opinions) were \u201cseminal\u201d\u2014\nseminal!\u2014decisions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. We are not bound\nby a litigant\u2019s concession on an issue of law. See, e.g., Grove City\nCollege v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 562, n. 10 (1984). And it should not be\nthought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self\ndenying act. To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitu\ntional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the\nPrivacy Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a (2006 ed. and Supp. III), already contains\nextensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional\nimprovisation. And because Congress\u2019s power under \u00a75 of the Four\nteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause,\nsee City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), the United States\nhas an incentive to give that Clause a broad reading, thus expanding\nthe scope of federal legislation that it justifies. Federal laws prevent\ning state disregard of \u201cinformational privacy\u201d may be a twinkle in the\nSolicitor General\u2019s eye.\n6                     NASA v.

S. 479 (1965), concerning the \u201cpenum\nbra\u201d of the First Amendment; and three concurring or\ndissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated\nthat there might be such a thing as a substantive due\nprocess right to informational privacy. 429 U. S., at 599,\nn. 25. Nixon provided even less support. After citing the\nobservation in Whalen that \u201c[o]ne element of privacy has\nbeen characterized as the individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters,\u201d Nixon, supra, at 457\n(quoting Whalen, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward Fourth\nAmendment analysis. It \u201cassume[d]\u201d that there was a\n\u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the materials, and\nrejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the statute at issue\nwas \u201cprecisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amend\nment was intended to prevent.\u201d Nixon, supra, at 457\u2013458,\n460. It is unfathomable why these cases\u2019 passing, barely\nexplained reference to a right separate from the Fourth\nAmendment\u2014an unenumerated right that they held to be\nnot applicable\u2014should be afforded stare decisis weight.\n   At this point the reader may be wondering: \u201cWhat, after\nall, is the harm in being \u2018minimalist\u2019 and simply refusing\nto say that violation of a constitutional right of informa\ntional privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is\nthe same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypo\nthetical right was not violated.\u201d Well, there is harm. The\nCourt\u2019s never-say-never disposition does damage for sev\neral reasons.\n   1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.\nBy substituting for one real constitutional question\n(whether there exists a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy) a different constitutional question (whether\nNASA\u2019s background checks would contravene a right to\ninformational privacy if such a right existed), the Court\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its\nbusiness: the appropriate balance between security and\nprivacy. If I am correct that there exists no right to in\nformational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in\njudicial maximalism. Better simply to state and apply\nthe law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law in\npectore, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our\ncharter, and probably beyond our ken.\n  If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to\nsee the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion\nanalyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is\n\u201cassumed\u201d rather than \u201cdecided.\u201d Thirty-three years have\npassed since the Court first suggested that the right may,\nor may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon\nthis Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.\n  2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it\nmakes no sense. The Court decides that the Government\ndid not violate the right to informational privacy without\ndeciding whether there is a right to informational privacy,\nand without even describing what hypothetical standard\nshould be used to assess whether the hypothetical right\nhas been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to\nanother of the Court\u2019s never-say-never dispositions:\n    \u201c[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents\u2019] claim\n    fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\n    consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a hypothetical\n    standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is suf\n    ficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as\n    well acknowledge the right as well. Or [it] could avoid\n    the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical stan\n    dard by denying the right. But embracing a standard\n    while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and de\n    ciding this case while addressing neither the standard\n    nor the right is quite impossible.\u201d Stop the Beach Re\n8                      NASA v.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion)\n    (joined by ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 12\u201313).\nWhatever the virtues of judicial minimalism, it cannot\njustify judicial incoherence.\n   The Court defends its approach by observing that\n\u201cwe have only the \u2018scarce and open-ended\u2019 \u201d guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way.\u201d Ante, at 11,\nn. 10. I would have thought that this doctrinal obscurity\nshould lead us to provide more clarity for lower courts;\nsurely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for\nanother.\n   The Court observes that I have joined other opinions\nthat have assumed the existence of constitutional rights.\nIbid. It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitu\ntional questions, so long as answering those questions is\nunnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented\nin the case. So in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,\n497 U. S. 261, 279\u2013280 (1990), we declined to decide\nwhether a competent person had a constitutional right to\nrefuse lifesaving hydration, because\u2014under a constitu\ntional standard we laid out in detail\u2014such a right did not\nexist for an incompetent person. In Herrera v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 390, 417\u2013418 (1993), we declined to decide whether\nit would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent per\nson, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.\nIn New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,\n487 U. S. 1, 10\u201315 (1988), we declined to decide whether\nthere was a constitutional right of private association for\ncertain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial\nchallenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in\nmany of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide\nwhether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could\nsucceed. Here, however, the Court actually applies a\nconstitutional informational privacy standard without\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.\nConsider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant\nfactors alluded to in today\u2019s opinion:\n\u2022\t It is relevant that the Government is acting \u201cin its\n   capacity \u2018as proprietor\u2019 and manager of its \u2018internal op\n   eration.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are\n   told neither what the appropriate standard should be\n   when the Government is acting as regulator nor what\n   the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as\n   proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on\n   the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.\n\u2022\t History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at\n   13\u201314, but how much is uncertain. The Court points\n   out that the Federal Government has been conducting\n   investigations of candidates for employment since the\n   earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges\n   that extension of those investigations to employees of\n   contractors is of very recent vintage.\n\u2022\t The contract employees are doing important work.\n   They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they\n   are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at\n   15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today\u2019s case\n   would be different for background checks of lower-level\n   employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never\n   told.\n\u2022\t Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)\n   constitutional because they are \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cuseful,\u201d\n   and \u201chumane.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317 (internal quotation\n   marks omitted). And questions to third parties are\n   constitutional because they are \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cper\n   vasiv[e].\u201d Ante, at 18\u201319. Any or all of these adjectives\n   may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of\n   the hypothetical constitutional right to \u201cinformational\n   privacy\u201d is evaluated.\n10                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u2022\t The Court notes that a \u201c \u2018statutory or regulatory duty\n   to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u2019 generally allays\n   these privacy concerns,\u201d ante, at 20 (emphasis added),\n   but it gives no indication of what the exceptions to this\n   general rule might be. It then discusses the provisions\n   of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em\n   phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA\u2019s routine\n   use regulations. Ante, at 21\u201323. From the length of\n   the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec\n   essary to today\u2019s holding, but how much of it is neces\n   sary is a mystery.\n   4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits\nclaiming violations of the right to informational privacy.\nRare will be the claim that is supported by none of the\nfactors deemed relevant in today\u2019s opinion. Moreover, the\nutter silliness of respondents\u2019 position in this case leaves\nplenty of room for the possible success of future claims\nthat are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents\nclaim that even though they are Government contractor\nemployees, and even though they are working with highly\nexpensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov\nernment is seeking only information about drug treatment\nand information from third parties that is standard in\nbackground checks, and even though the Government is\nliable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and\neven though NASA\u2019s Privacy Act regulations are very\nprotective of private information, NASA\u2019s background\nchecks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully\nciting all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the\nCourt makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.\n   In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 in those\ncircuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a\nconstitutional right to \u201cinformational privacy,\u201d lawyers\nwill always (and I mean always) find some way around\ntoday\u2019s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant\nwill be liable not only for damages but also for attorney\u2019s\nfees under \u00a71988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue,\nand defendants\u2014for whom no safe harbor can be found in\nthe many words of today\u2019s opinion\u2014to settle.

Ante, at 1\n(opinion concurring in judgment). No provision in the\nConstitution mentions such a right. Cf. Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558, 605\u2013606 (2003) (THOMAS, J., dissent\ning) (\u201cI can find neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other\npart of the Constitution a general right of privacy . . . \u201d\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). And\nthe notion that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment is a wellspring of unenumerated rights\nagainst the Federal Government \u201cstrains credulity for\neven the most casual user of words.\u201d McDonald v. Chi\ncago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7).\n</pre>",
