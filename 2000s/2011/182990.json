NELSON ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–530.     Argued October 5, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a\n  workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract em\n  ployees. Respondents are contract employees at NASA’s Jet Propul\n  sion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute\n  of Technology (Cal Tech). Respondents were not subject to Govern\n  ment background checks at the time they were hired, but that\n  changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identifi\n  cation standards for both federal civil servants and contractor em\n  ployees. The Department of Commerce mandated that contract em\n  ployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard\n  background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquir\n  ies (NACI), by October 2007. NASA modified its contract with Cal\n  Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that em\n  ployees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be de\n  nied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.\n    The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins\n  with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form\n  85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF–85)). SF–85\n  asks whether an employee has “used, possessed, supplied, or manu\n  factured illegal drugs” in the last year. If so, the employee must pro\n  vide details, including information about “treatment or counseling re\n  ceived.” The employee must also sign a release authorizing the\n  Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers,\n  and others during its investigation. Once SF–85 is completed, the\n  Government sends the employee’s references a questionnaire (Form\n  42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have “any\n  reason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustworthiness,” or\n2                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have “adverse information” concerning a variety of other matters. All\n    SF–85 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the\n    Privacy Act.\n       With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near,\n    respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the back\n    ground-check process violates a constitutional right to informational\n    privacy. The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunc\n    tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that SF–85’s inquiries\n    into recent drug involvement furthered the Government’s interest in\n    combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug “treatment or counsel\n    ing” question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to\n    be held unconstitutional. It also held that Form 42’s open-ended\n    questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government’s inter\n    ests in verifying contractors’ identities and ensuring JPL’s security,\n    and thus also likely violated respondents’ informational-privacy\n    rights.\nHeld:\n    1. In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred\n broadly to a constitutional privacy “interest in avoiding disclosure of\n personal matters.” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600; Nixon v.\n Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457. In Whalen, the\n Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and\n addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the\n statute’s “security provisions,” which protected against “public disclo\n sure” of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600–601, were sufficient to\n protect a privacy interest “arguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,”\n id., at 605. In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former\n President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for\n archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at is\n sue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against “undue dis\n semination of private materials.” 433 U. S, at 458. Since Nixon, the\n Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to in\n formational privacy. Pp. 8–10.\n    2. Assuming, without deciding, that the Government’s challenged\n inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance,\n that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government\n from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF–85 and\n Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject\n to the Privacy Act’s safeguards against public disclosure. Pp. 10–24.\n       (a) The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests\n at stake. Pp. 11–19.\n         (1) Judicial review of the forms must take into account the con\n text in which the Government’s challenged inquiries arise. When the\n Government acts in its capacity “as proprietor” and manager of its\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“internal operation,” Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to\ncitizens generally. The questions respondents challenge are part of a\nstandard background check of the sort used by millions of private\nemployers. The Government has been conducting employment inves\ntigations since the Republic’s earliest days, and the President has\nhad statutory authority to assess an applicant’s fitness for the civil\nservice since 1871. Standard background investigations similar to\nthose at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates\nin 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision\nto extend that requirement to federal contract employees. This his\ntory shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and\nto employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people’s\nbusiness. The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents\nare contract employees. There are no meaningful distinctions in the\nduties of NASA’s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at\nJPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA’s\nmission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer in\nvestment. Pp. 12–15.\n       (2) The challenged questions on SF–85 and Form 42 are rea\nsonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government’s\ninterests in managing its internal operations. SF–85’s “treatment or\ncounseling” question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry\nabout illegal-drug use. In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also\na reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recog\nnizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue,\nseeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to ad\ndress and overcome their problems. Thus, it uses responses to the\ndrug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor cre\ndentialing decisions. The Court rejects the argument that the Gov\nernment has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its em\nployment background questions are “necessary” or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard\nruns directly contrary to Whalen. See 429 U. S., at 596–597. Pp. 16–\n18.\n       (3) Like SF–85’s drug-treatment question, Form 42’s open\nended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employ\nees who will faithfully conduct the Government’s business. Asking\nan applicant’s designated references broad questions about job suit\nability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from\nweak ones. The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by\ntheir pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Pp. 18–19.\n     (b) In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government in\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    terests at stake, SF–85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial\n    protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec\n    ognized that a “statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted\n    disclosures” generally allays privacy concerns created by government\n    “accumulation” of “personal information” for “public purposes.”\n    Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government’s\n    collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in\n    formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo\n    sure. The Privacy Act—which allows the Government to maintain\n    only those records “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a purpose\n    authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1); requires written consent be\n    fore the Government may disclose an individual’s records, §552a(b);\n    and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo\n    sure obligations, §552a(i)(1)—“evidence[s] a proper concern” for indi\n    vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458–459.\n    Respondents’ claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s\n    disclosure bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous\n    to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But\n    that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and\n    the Privacy Act.

Roe,\n429 U. S. 589, 599–600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents\nin this case, federal contract employees at a Government\nlaboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment\nbackground investigation violate their rights under\nWhalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a\nform questionnaire that asks employees about treatment\nor counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object\nto certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ\nees’ designated references.\n   We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution\nprotects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen\nand Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por\ntions of the Government’s background check do not violate\nthis right in the present case.

C. §552a, satisfy any “interest in avoiding disclosure”\nthat may “arguably ha[ve] its roots in the Constitution.”\nWhalen, supra, at 599, 605.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) is an independent federal agency charged with\nplanning and conducting the Government’s “space activi\nties.” Pub. L. 111–314, §3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.\n§20112(a)(1). NASA’s workforce numbers in the tens of\nthousands of employees. While many of these workers are\nfederal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed\ndirectly by Government contractors. Contract employees\nplay an important role in NASA’s mission, and their du\nties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil\nservants.\n   One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\nin Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract\nemployees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute\nof Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a\nGovernment contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for\ndeep-space robotics and communications. Most of this\ncountry’s unmanned space missions—from the Explorer 1\nsatellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today—have been\ndeveloped and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to\nNASA earth-observation and technology-development\nprojects. Many JPL employees also engage in pure scien\ntific research on topics like “the star formation history of\nthe universe” and “the fundamental properties of quantum\nfluids.” App. 64–65, 68.\n   Twenty-eight JPL employees are respondents here.\nMany of them have worked at the lab for decades, and\nnone has ever been the subject of a Government back\n                   Cite as: 562 U.

At the time when respondents were\nhired, background checks were standard only for federal\ncivil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936\n(1949–1953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con\ntracts required background checks for the employees of\nfederal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.\n   The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate\nthis two-track approach to background investigations.\nIn 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission\nprompted the President to order new, uniform identifica\ntion standards for “[f]ederal employees,” including “con\ntractor employees.”       Homeland Security Presidential\nDirective/HSPD–12—Policy for a Common Identification\nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public\nPapers of the President, George W.

The\nprocess begins when the applicant or employee fills out a\nform questionnaire.       Employees who work in “non\nsensitive” positions (as all respondents here do) complete\nStandard Form 85 (SF–85). Office of Personnel Manage\nment (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for Non-\nSensitive Positions, App. 88–95.2\n   Most of the questions on SF–85 seek basic biographical\ninformation: name, address, prior residences, education,\nemployment history, and personal and professional refer\nences. The form also asks about citizenship, selective\nservice registration, and military service. The last ques\ntion asks whether the employee has “used, possessed,\nsupplied, or manufactured illegal drugs” in the last year.\nId., at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide\ndetails, including information about “any treatment or\ncounseling received.” Ibid. A “truthful response,” the\nform notes, cannot be used as evidence against the em\nployee in a criminal proceeding. Ibid. The employee must\ncertify that all responses on the form are true and must\nsign a release authorizing the Government to obtain per\nsonal information from schools, employers, and others\nduring its investigation.\n\n——————\n  2 For public-trust and national-security positions, more detailed forms\n\nare required.

The\nGovernment runs the information provided by the em\nployee through FBI and other federal-agency databases.\nIt also sends out form questionnaires to the former em\nployers, schools, landlords, and references listed on SF–85.\nThe particular form at issue in this case—the Investiga\ntive Request for Personal Information, Form 42—goes to\nthe employee’s former landlords and references. Ibid.3\n   Form 42 is a two-page document that takes about five\nminutes to complete. See ibid. It explains to the reference\nthat “[y]our name has been provided by” a particular\nemployee or applicant to help the Government determine\nthat person’s “suitability for employment or a security\nclearance.” App. 96–97. After several preliminary ques\ntions about the extent of the reference’s associations with\nthe employee, the form asks if the reference has “any\nreason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustwor\nthiness.” Id., at 97. It also asks if the reference knows of\nany “adverse information” concerning the employee’s\n“violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse of\nalcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”\n“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid. If\n“yes” is checked for any of these categories, the form calls\nfor an explanation in the space below. That space is also\navailable for providing “additional information” (“deroga\ntory” or “favorable”) that may bear on “suitability for\ngovernment employment or a security clearance.” Ibid.\n   All responses to SF–85 and Form 42 are subject to the\nprotections of the Privacy Act.

App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara\ntory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents’\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit\ngranted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713\n(2007), and later reversed the District Court’s order. The\ncourt held that portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 are\nlikely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en\njoined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d\n865 (2008).\n   Turning first to SF–85, the Court of Appeals noted\nrespondents’ concession “that most of the questions” on the\nform are “unproblematic” and do not “implicate the consti\ntutional right to informational privacy.” 530 F. 3d, at 878.\nBut the court determined that the “group of questions\nconcerning illegal drugs” required closer scrutiny. Ibid.\nApplying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF–85’s\ninquiries into recent involvement with drugs as “necessary\nto further the government’s legitimate interest” in combat\ning illegal-drug use.

Ibid.\n   Form 42, in the Court of Appeals’ estimation, was even\n“more problematic.” Ibid. The form’s “open-ended and\nhighly private” questions, the court concluded, were not\n“narrowly tailored” to meet the Government’s interests in\nverifying contractors’ identities and “ensuring the security\nof the JPL.” Id., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held,\nthese “open-ended” questions, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF–85, likely violate respondents’ informa\ntional-privacy rights.5\n   Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc. 568 F. 3d 1028 (2009). We\ngranted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n——————\n   5 In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also challenged the criteria that\n\nthey believe the Government will use to determine their “suitability”\nfor employment at JPL. Respondents relied on a document, which had\nbeen temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur\nportedly bearing on suitability for federal employment.

Other factors, which were listed under the\nheading “Criminal or Immoral Conduct,” included “indecent exposure,”\n“voyeurism,” “indecent proposal[s],” and “carnal knowledge.” Id., at 98.\nThe document also stated that while “homosexuality,” “adultery,” and\n“illegitimate children” were not “suitability” issues in and of them\nselves, they might pose “security issue[s]” if circumstances indicated a\n“susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.” Id., at 102.

This Court considered a similar\nclaim in Whalen, 429 U. S. 589, which concerned New\nYork’s practice of collecting “the names and addresses of\nall persons” prescribed dangerous drugs with both “legiti\nmate and illegitimate uses.” Id., at 591. In discussing\nthat claim, the Court said that “[t]he cases sometimes\ncharacterized as protecting ‘privacy’ ” actually involved “at\nleast two different kinds of interests”: one, an “interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters”;6 the other, an\ninterest in “making certain kinds of important decisions”\nfree from government interference.7 The patients who\nbrought suit in Whalen argued that New York’s statute\n“threaten[ed] to impair” both their “nondisclosure” inter\nests and their interests in making healthcare decisions\nindependently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld\nthe statute as a “reasonable exercise of New York’s broad\npolice powers.” Id., at 598.\n  Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of “private\ninformation” to the State was an “unpleasant invasion of\nprivacy,” id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the\nNew York statute contained “security provisions” that\n——————\n   6 429 U.

This sort of “statutory or regulatory\nduty to avoid unwarranted disclosures” of “accumulated\nprivate data” was sufficient, in the Court’s view, to protect\na privacy interest that “arguably ha[d] its roots in the\nConstitution.” Id., at 605–606. The Court thus concluded\nthat the statute did not violate “any right or liberty pro\ntected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 606.\n   Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti\ntutional “interest in avoiding disclosure.” Nixon, 433\nU. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former\nPresident Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential\nRecordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,\nnote following 44 U. S. C. §2111, a statute that required\nhim to turn over his presidential papers and tape re\ncordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at\n455–465. In a section of the opinion entitled “Privacy,” the\nCourt addressed a combination of claims that the review\nrequired by this Act violated the former President’s\n“Fourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]” rights. Id., at 455, and\nn. 18, 458–459. The Court rejected those challenges after\nconcluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in\nWhalen, contained protections against “undue dissemina\ntion of private materials.” 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the\nCourt observed that the former President’s claim was\n“weaker” than the one “found wanting . . . in Whalen,” as\nthe Government was required to return immediately all\n“purely private papers and recordings” identified by the\narchivists. Id., at 458–459. Citing Fourth Amendment\nprecedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in\npreserving presidential papers outweighed any “legitimate\nexpectation of privacy” that the former President may\nhave enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389\nU. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry\n10                        NASA v.

Many courts hold\nthat disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be\nsubject to a test that balances the government’s interests against the\nindividual’s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,\n712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel\nphia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v.

One of\nthese opinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will “har[m]\nour image, if not our self-respect,” post, at 7 (SCALIA, J.), and will cause\npractical problems, post, at 8–9. There are sound reasons for eschewing\nthe concurring opinions’ recommended course.\n   “The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not\nsit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially\nas arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties\nbefore them.” Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)\n(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask\nus to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,\nand respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from\naddressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a\nmatter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit\nof briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice\nthat the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (“no need in\nthis case” for broad decision on “the scope of a constitutionally-based\nright to privacy for certain information”). Particularly in cases like this\none, where we have only the “scarce and open-ended” guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U.

McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts\nthe challenged background checks in its capacity “as pro\nprietor” and manager of its “internal operation.” Ibid.\nTime and again our cases have recognized that the Gov\nernment has a much freer hand in dealing “with citizen\nemployees than it does when it brings its sovereign power\nto bear on citizens at large.” Engquist v.

The questions challenged by respondents are\npart of a standard employment background check of the\nsort used by millions of private employers. See Brief for\nConsumer Data Indus. Assn. et al. as Amici Curiae 2\n(hereinafter CDIA Brief) (“[M]ore than 88% of U. S.\ncompanies . . . perform background checks on their em\nployees”). The Government itself has been conducting\nemployment investigations since the earliest days of the\nRepublic. L.

Since\n1871, the President has enjoyed statutory authority to\n“ascertain the fitness of applicants” for the civil service “as\nto age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the\nemployment sought,” Act of Mar. 3, 1871, Rev.

And the particular investigations challenged in\nthis case arose from a decision to extend that requirement\nto federal contract employees requiring long-term access to\nfederal facilities. See HSPD–12, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS\nPUB 201–1, at iii–vi, 1–8, App. 131–150.\n  As this long history suggests, the Government has an\ninterest in conducting basic employment background\nchecks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em\nployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its\nfacilities and in employing a competent, reliable work\nforce. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Courts must keep\nthose interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line\nthrough the Government’s employment forms and to\nscrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they\ncontain.\n  Respondents argue that, because they are contract\nemployees and not civil servants, the Government’s broad\nauthority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin\nished force. But the Government’s interest as “proprietor”\nin managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work\ners, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See\nBoard of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S.\n668, 678, 679 (1996) (formal distinctions such as whether\na “service provider” has a “contract of employment or a\ncontract for services” with the government is a “very poor\nproxy” for constitutional interests at stake). The fact that\nrespondents’ direct employment relationship is with Cal\nTech—which operates JPL under a Government con\ntract—says very little about the interests at stake in this\ncase.

The two classes of employees\nperform “functionally equivalent duties,” and the extent of\nemployees’ “access to NASA . . . facilities” turns not on\nformal status but on the nature of “the jobs they perform.”\nIbid.\n  At JPL, in particular, the work that contract employees\nperform is critical to NASA’s mission.

This is important work,\nand all of it is funded with a multibillion dollar investment\nfrom the American taxpayer. See NASA, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The\nGovernment has a strong interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks into the contract employees minding\nthe store at JPL.12\n——————\n   12 In their brief, respondents also rely on the fact that many of them\n\nhave been working at JPL for years and that Cal Tech previously\nvetted them through standard “employment reference checks.” Brief\nfor Respondents 52–53. The record indicates that this may be wrong as\na factual matter. E.g., 7 Record 391 (“I have not been required to\nundergo any type of background investigation to maintain my position\nwith JPL”); id., at 397 (“I have never been required to undergo any type\nof background investigation to maintain my position with JPL other\nthan . . . [one] which required that I provide my name, social security\nnumber, and current address” to facilitate a “check for outstanding\nwarrants, arrests, or convictions”); id., at 356, 367, 386–387 (similar).\nEven if it were correct, the fact that Cal Tech once conducted a back\nground check on respondents does not diminish the Government’s\ninterests in conducting its own standard background check to satisfy\nitself that contract employees should be granted continued access to the\nGovernment’s facility. In any event, counsel abandoned this position at\noral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.\n16                    NASA v.

See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598–599; Whalen, 429\nU. S., at 597–598. As to SF–85, the only part of the form\nchallenged here is its request for information about “any\ntreatment or counseling received” for illegal-drug use\nwithin the previous year. The “treatment or counseling”\nquestion, however, must be considered in context. It is a\nfollowup to SF–85’s inquiry into whether the employee has\n“used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs”\nduring the past year. The Government has good reason to\nask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like\nany employer, the Government is entitled to have its\nprojects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will\n“ ‘efficiently and effectively’ ” discharge their duties. See\nEngquist, supra, at 598–599. Questions about illegal-drug\nuse are a useful way of figuring out which persons have\nthese characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An\nUpdated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in\nthe Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi\nronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated\nwith workplace productivity).\n    In context, the follow-up question on “treatment or\ncounseling” for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,\nemployment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz\ning that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical\nissue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who\nare taking steps to address and overcome their problems.\nThe Government thus uses responses to the “treatment or\ncounseling” question as a mitigating factor in determining\nwhether to grant contract employees long-term access to\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Re\nspondents’ argument is that, if drug treatment is only\nused to mitigate, then the Government should change the\nmandatory phrasing of SF–85—“Include [in your answer]\nany treatment or counseling received”—so as to make a\nresponse optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory\n“treatment or counseling” question is unconstitutional, in\nrespondents’ view, because it is “more intrusive than\nnecessary to satisfy the government’s objective.” Brief for\nRespondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that “treat\nment or counseling” question should be enjoined because\nthe form “appears to compel disclosure”).\n   We reject the argument that the Government, when it\nrequests job-related personal information in an employ\nment background check, has a constitutional burden to\ndemonstrate that its questions are “necessary” or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a\nstandard runs directly contrary to Whalen. The patients\nin Whalen, much like respondents here, argued that New\nYork’s statute was unconstitutional because the State\ncould not “demonstrate the necessity” of its program. 429\nU. S., at 596. The Court quickly rejected that argument,\nconcluding that New York’s collection of patients’ prescrip\ntion information could “not be held unconstitutional sim\nply because” a court viewed it as “unnecessary, in whole or\n——————\n   13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern\n\nment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, “despite counseling and\nrehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita\ntion.” 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the\nActing Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or\ncounseling solely as a “mitigat[ing]” factor that ameliorates concerns\nabout recent illegal drug use. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n18                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin part.” Id., at 596–597.\n  That analysis applies with even greater force where the\nGovernment acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager\nof its internal affairs. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.\nSF–85’s “treatment or counseling” question reasonably\nseeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who\nare attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern\nment’s considered position is that phrasing the question in\nmore permissive terms would result in a lower response\nrate, and the question’s effectiveness in identifying illegal\ndrug users who are suitable for employment would be\n“materially reduced.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That\nis a reasonable position, falling within the “ ‘wide lati\ntude’ ” granted the Government in its dealings with em\nployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.\n                              3\n  The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, “open\nended questions” on Form 42 likely violate respondents’\ninformational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants’\ndesignated references and landlords for “information”\nbearing on “suitability for government employment or a\nsecurity clearance.” App. 97. In a series of questions, the\nGovernment asks if the reference has any “adverse infor\nmation” about the applicant’s “honesty or trustworthi\nness,” “violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse\nof alcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”\n“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid.\n  These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF–85, are reasonably aimed at identifying\ncapable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov\nernment’s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.\nAsking an applicant’s designated references broad, open\nended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool\nfor separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would\nbe a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

See CDIA Brief 6–7 (references “typi\ncally have limited time to answer questions from potential\nemployers,” and “open-ended questions” yield more rele\nvant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by\ncontrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.\n5359.\n   The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is\nillustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private\nsectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over\n1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of\nopen-ended questions in employment background checks\nappears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.\nSee, e.g., S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compli\nance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference\nChecks on Job Applicants (“Following are the guidelines\nfor conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open\nended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer”);\nM. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (“Also\nask, ‘Is there anything else I need to know about [candi\ndate’s name]?’ This kind of open-ended question may turn\nup all kinds of information you wouldn’t have gotten any\nother way”). The use of similar open-ended questions by\nthe Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in\nmanaging its operations.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Not only are SF–85 and Form 42 reasonable in light of\nthe Government interests at stake, they are also subject to\nsubstantial protections against disclosure to the public.\nBoth Whalen and Nixon recognized that government\n“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public pur\nposes” may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457–458, 462. But both deci\n20                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions also stated that a “statutory or regulatory duty to\navoid unwarranted disclosures” generally allays these\nprivacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at\n458–459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York’s\n“security provisions” prohibiting public disclosure, turned\naside a challenge to the collection of patients’ prescription\ninformation. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600–601, 605.\nIn Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even\n“weaker” claim by the former President because the Presi\ndential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act “[n]ot\nonly . . . mandate[d] regulations” against “undue dissemi\nnation,” but also required immediate return of any “purely\nprivate” materials flagged by the Government’s archivists.\n433 U. S., at 458–459.\n  Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen\nand former President Nixon, attack only the Government’s\ncollection of information on SF–85 and Form 42. And\nhere, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information\ncollected is shielded by statute from “unwarranted disclo\nsur[e].” See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,\nwhich covers all information collected during the back\nground-check process, allows the Government to maintain\nrecords “about an individual” only to the extent the re\ncords are “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a pur\npose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1). The Act\nrequires written consent before the Government may\ndisclose records pertaining to any individual. §552a(b).\nAnd the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations\nof its nondisclosure obligations. §552a(i)(1). These re\nquirements, as we have noted, give “forceful recognition”\nto a Government employee’s interest in maintaining the\n“confidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person\nnel files.” Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,\nn. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in\nWhalen and Nixon, they “evidence a proper concern” for\nindividual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 458–459.\n                              2\n   Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue\nthat statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s disclosure\nbar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous\nto supply a meaningful check against “unwarranted dis\nclosures,” Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in\nparticular to what they describe as a “broad” exception\nfor “routine use[s],” defined as uses that are “compatible\nwith the purpose for which the record was collected.”\n§§552a(b)(3), (a)(7).\n   Respondents’ reliance on these exceptions rests on an\nincorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of\nthe Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and\nNixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory\nprotections against “unwarranted disclosures” and “undue\ndissemination” of personal information collected by the\nGovernment. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.\nNeither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is\nneeded to satisfy privacy interests that may be “root[ed] in\nthe Constitution.” Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the\nNew York statute prohibiting “[p]ublic disclosure of the\nidentity of patients” was itself subject to several excep\ntions. 429 U. S., at 594–595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the\nprotections against “undue dissemination” mentioned in\nthe opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be\nincluded in forthcoming regulations “mandate[d]” by the\nchallenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437–439\n(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the\nAct’s “facial validity” and was not considering the Admin\nistrator’s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact\nthat the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement is sub\nject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides\ninsufficient protection against public disclosure.\n   Nor does the substance of the “routine use” exception\n22                      NASA v. NELSON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrelied on by respondents create any undue risk of public\ndissemination. None of the authorized “routine use[s]” of\nrespondents’ background-check information allows for\nrelease to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859–45860, 45862\n(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.\nReg. 28307 (2010).       Rather, the established “routine\nuse[s]” consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to\ncomplete the background-check process in an efficient and\norderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving\ndisclosures to authorized New York Department of Health\nemployees that were not “meaningfully distinguishable”\nfrom routine disclosures “associated with many facets of\nhealth care”). One routine use, for example, involves a\nlimited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that\ndesignated references can “identify the individual” at issue\nand can understand the “nature and purpose of the inves\ntigation.” App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review\neach completed SF–85 to verify that all requested infor\nmation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated\nJPL employees may not “disclose any information con\ntained in the form to anyone else,” ibid., and Cal Tech is\nnot given access to adverse information uncovered during\nthe Government’s background check, id., at 207–208. The\n“remote possibility” of public disclosure created by these\nnarrow “routine use[s]” does not undermine the Privacy\nAct’s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n601–602 (“remote possibility” that statutory security\nprovisions will “provide inadequate protection against\nunwarranted disclosures” not a sufficient basis for striking\ndown statute).\n   Citing past violations of the Privacy Act,14 respondents\n\n——————\n  14 E.g.,\n         GAO, Personal Information: Data Breaches are Frequent, but\nEvidence of Resulting Identity Theft is Limited; However, the Full\nExtent Is Unknown 5, 20 (GAO 07–737, 2007) (over 3-year period, 788\ndata breaches occurred at 17 federal agencies).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnote that it is possible that their personal information\ncould be disclosed as a result of a similar breach. But data\nbreaches are a possibility any time the Government stores\ninformation. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere\npossibility that security measures will fail provides no\n“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also\ncite a portion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure\n“[t]o the news media or the general public.” App. 89. By\nits terms, this exception allows public disclosure only\nwhere release is “in the public interest” and would not\nresult in “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\nIbid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a\ndisclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario\nin which their information might be unduly disclosed\nunder this exception.15\n   In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act’s\nnondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged\nportions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an\nemployment background check, we conclude that the\nGovernment’s inquiries do not violate a constitutional\nright to informational privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605.\n                        *     *    *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n  15 Respondents  further contend that the Privacy Act’s ability to deter\nunauthorized release of private information is significantly hampered\nby the fact that the statute provides only “an ex post money-damages\naction,” not injunctive relief. Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.\nChao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in\nWhalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action—for money\ndamages or injunctive relief—is needed in order to provide sufficient\nprotection against public disclosure.\n24                 NASA v.

But rather than reach this con\nclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption\nthat the Constitution requires courts to “balance” the\nGovernment’s interests in data collection against its con\ntractor employees’ interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler\ngrounds. Like many other desirable things not included\nin the Constitution, “informational privacy” seems like a\ngood idea—wherefore the People have enacted laws at the\nfederal level and in the states restricting the government’s\ncollection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo\nple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they\nthink it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu\ntional right to “informational privacy” does not exist.\n   Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I\nmust observe a remarkable and telling fact about this\ncase, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents’\nbrief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the\nConstitution, does not once identify which provision of\nthe Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities\ncontains citations of cases from federal and state courts,\n2                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfederal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four\nstates, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even\nmore exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the\nGovernment Accountability Office and an EEOC document\nconcerning “Enforcement Guidance.” And yet it contains\nnot a single citation of the sole document we are called\nupon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.\nThe body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference\nto the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the\nassuredly inapposite Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558\n(2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is\nmade to argue that NASA’s actions deprived respondents\nof liberty without due process of law. And this legal strat\negy was not limited to respondents’ filing in this Court; in\nthe Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that\n“courts have grounded the right to informational privacy\nin various provisions of the Constitution,” Brief for Appel\nlants in No. 07–56424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify\nwhich ones applied here.\n   To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly\nhonest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right\nout of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pre\ntense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Re\ngrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral\nargument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first\ntime in this litigation, that the right to informational\nprivacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. That counsel in\nvoked the infinitely plastic concept of “substantive” due\nprocess does not make this constitutional theory any less\ninvented.\n   This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that\nthe Due Process Clause does not “guarante[e] certain\n(unspecified) liberties”; rather, it “merely guarantees\ncertain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of\nliberty.” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that\nthe State has deprived them of liberty without the requi\nsite procedures, and their due process claim therefore\nmust fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for\nidentifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux\n“substantive” component of the Due Process Clause—that\n“the Due Process Clause specially protects those funda\nmental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply\nrooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721 (1997) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—respondents’ claim would fail.\nRespondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim\nat issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing\nthe farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply\nrooted in our history and tradition bars the Government\nfrom ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by\nrecovering drug addicts.\n   The absurdity of respondents’ position in this case\nshould not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due\nprocess precedents, even our “substantive due process”\nprecedents, do not support any right to informational\nprivacy. First, we have held that the government’s act of\ndefamation does not deprive a person “of any ‘liberty’\nprotected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976).\nWe reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not “sig\nnificantly alte[r]” a person’s legal status so as to “justif[y]\nthe invocation of procedural safeguards.” Id., at 708–709.\nIf outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable\nthat the mere disclosure of private information does.\n   Second, respondents challenge the Government’s collec\ntion of their private information. But the Government’s\ncollection of private information is regulated by the Fourth\nAmendment, and “[w]here a particular Amendment pro\nvides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\nagainst a particular sort of government behavior, that\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment, not the more generalized notion of substan\ntive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these\nclaims.” County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,\n842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration\nin original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents’\nFourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the\nForm 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth\nAmendment “searches” under United States v. Miller, 425\nU. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does\nnot prohibit the Government from asking questions about\nprivate information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876–877 (2008). That\nshould have been the end of the matter. Courts should not\nuse the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they\ndeem unsightly in the protections provided by other con\nstitutional provisions.\n   In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu\ntional right to “informational privacy.” Besides being\nconsistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view\nhas the attractive benefit of resolving this case without\nresort to the Court’s exegesis on the Government’s legiti\nmate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and\nthe comfortingly narrow scope of NASA’s “routine use”\nregulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further\nexplanation of the incoherence of the Court’s “substantive\ndue process” doctrine in its many manifestations, since the\nCourt does not play the substantive-due-process card.\nInstead, it states that it will “assume, without deciding”\nthat there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,\nat 1.\n   The Court’s sole justification for its decision to “assume,\nwithout deciding” is that the Court made the same mis\ntake before—in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589 (1977), and Nixon v. Administrator of General\nServices, 433 U. S. 425 (1977).* Ante, at 11.

Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “It is the preferred course because it\npromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent\ndevelopment of legal principles.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, however, there is no applicable rule\nof law that is settled. To the contrary, Whalen and Nixon\ncreated an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution\ndid not contain and that today’s opinion perpetuates.\n   A further reason Whalen and Nixon are not entitled to\nstare decisis effect is that neither opinion supplied any\ncoherent reason why a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy might exist. As supporting authority,\nWhalen cited Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557 (1969), a\n\n——————\nfailure to address whether there is a right to informational privacy\ncannot be blamed upon the Government’s concession that such a right\nexists, and indeed the Government’s startling assertion that Whalen\nand Nixon (which decided nothing on the constitutional point, and have\nnot been so much as cited in our later opinions) were “seminal”—\nseminal!—decisions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. We are not bound\nby a litigant’s concession on an issue of law. See, e.g., Grove City\nCollege v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 562, n. 10 (1984). And it should not be\nthought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self\ndenying act. To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitu\ntional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the\nPrivacy Act, 5 U. S. C. §552a (2006 ed. and Supp. III), already contains\nextensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional\nimprovisation. And because Congress’s power under §5 of the Four\nteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause,\nsee City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), the United States\nhas an incentive to give that Clause a broad reading, thus expanding\nthe scope of federal legislation that it justifies. Federal laws prevent\ning state disregard of “informational privacy” may be a twinkle in the\nSolicitor General’s eye.\n6                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nFirst Amendment case protecting private possession of\nobscenity; the deservedly infamous dictum in Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), concerning the “penum\nbra” of the First Amendment; and three concurring or\ndissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated\nthat there might be such a thing as a substantive due\nprocess right to informational privacy. 429 U. S., at 599,\nn. 25. Nixon provided even less support. After citing the\nobservation in Whalen that “[o]ne element of privacy has\nbeen characterized as the individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters,” Nixon, supra, at 457\n(quoting Whalen, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward Fourth\nAmendment analysis. It “assume[d]” that there was a\n“legitimate expectation of privacy” in the materials, and\nrejected the appellant’s argument that the statute at issue\nwas “precisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amend\nment was intended to prevent.” Nixon, supra, at 457–458,\n460. It is unfathomable why these cases’ passing, barely\nexplained reference to a right separate from the Fourth\nAmendment—an unenumerated right that they held to be\nnot applicable—should be afforded stare decisis weight.\n   At this point the reader may be wondering: “What, after\nall, is the harm in being ‘minimalist’ and simply refusing\nto say that violation of a constitutional right of informa\ntional privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is\nthe same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypo\nthetical right was not violated.” Well, there is harm. The\nCourt’s never-say-never disposition does damage for sev\neral reasons.\n   1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.\nBy substituting for one real constitutional question\n(whether there exists a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy) a different constitutional question (whether\nNASA’s background checks would contravene a right to\ninformational privacy if such a right existed), the Court\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

If I am correct that there exists no right to in\nformational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in\njudicial maximalism. Better simply to state and apply\nthe law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law in\npectore, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our\ncharter, and probably beyond our ken.\n  If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to\nsee the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion\nanalyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is\n“assumed” rather than “decided.” Thirty-three years have\npassed since the Court first suggested that the right may,\nor may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon\nthis Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.\n  2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it\nmakes no sense. The Court decides that the Government\ndid not violate the right to informational privacy without\ndeciding whether there is a right to informational privacy,\nand without even describing what hypothetical standard\nshould be used to assess whether the hypothetical right\nhas been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to\nanother of the Court’s never-say-never dispositions:\n    “[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents’] claim\n    fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\n    consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a hypothetical\n    standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is suf\n    ficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as\n    well acknowledge the right as well.

I would have thought that this doctrinal obscurity\nshould lead us to provide more clarity for lower courts;\nsurely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for\nanother.\n   The Court observes that I have joined other opinions\nthat have assumed the existence of constitutional rights.\nIbid. It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitu\ntional questions, so long as answering those questions is\nunnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented\nin the case. So in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,\n497 U. S. 261, 279–280 (1990), we declined to decide\nwhether a competent person had a constitutional right to\nrefuse lifesaving hydration, because—under a constitu\ntional standard we laid out in detail—such a right did not\nexist for an incompetent person. In Herrera v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 390, 417–418 (1993), we declined to decide whether\nit would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent per\nson, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.\nIn New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,\n487 U. S. 1, 10–15 (1988), we declined to decide whether\nthere was a constitutional right of private association for\ncertain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial\nchallenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in\nmany of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide\nwhether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could\nsucceed. Here, however, the Court actually applies a\nconstitutional informational privacy standard without\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.\nConsider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant\nfactors alluded to in today’s opinion:\n•\t It is relevant that the Government is acting “in its\n   capacity ‘as proprietor’ and manager of its ‘internal op\n   eration.’ ” Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are\n   told neither what the appropriate standard should be\n   when the Government is acting as regulator nor what\n   the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as\n   proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on\n   the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.\n•\t History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at\n   13–14, but how much is uncertain. The Court points\n   out that the Federal Government has been conducting\n   investigations of candidates for employment since the\n   earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges\n   that extension of those investigations to employees of\n   contractors is of very recent vintage.\n•\t The contract employees are doing important work.\n   They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they\n   are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at\n   15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today’s case\n   would be different for background checks of lower-level\n   employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never\n   told.\n•\t Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)\n   constitutional because they are “reasonable,” “useful,”\n   and “humane.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation\n   marks omitted). And questions to third parties are\n   constitutional because they are “appropriate” and “per\n   vasiv[e].” Ante, at 18–19. Any or all of these adjectives\n   may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of\n   the hypothetical constitutional right to “informational\n   privacy” is evaluated.\n10                     NASA v.

It then discusses the provisions\n   of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em\n   phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA’s routine\n   use regulations. Ante, at 21–23. From the length of\n   the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec\n   essary to today’s holding, but how much of it is neces\n   sary is a mystery.\n   4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits\nclaiming violations of the right to informational privacy.\nRare will be the claim that is supported by none of the\nfactors deemed relevant in today’s opinion. Moreover, the\nutter silliness of respondents’ position in this case leaves\nplenty of room for the possible success of future claims\nthat are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents\nclaim that even though they are Government contractor\nemployees, and even though they are working with highly\nexpensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov\nernment is seeking only information about drug treatment\nand information from third parties that is standard in\nbackground checks, and even though the Government is\nliable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and\neven though NASA’s Privacy Act regulations are very\nprotective of private information, NASA’s background\nchecks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully\nciting all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the\nCourt makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.\n   In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. §1983 in those\ncircuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a\nconstitutional right to “informational privacy,” lawyers\nwill always (and I mean always) find some way around\ntoday’s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant\nwill be liable not only for damages but also for attorney’s\nfees under §1988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue,\nand defendants—for whom no safe harbor can be found in\nthe many words of today’s opinion—to settle.

NELSON ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–530.     Argued October 5, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a\n  workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract em\n  ployees. Respondents are contract employees at NASA’s Jet Propul\n  sion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute\n  of Technology (Cal Tech). Respondents were not subject to Govern\n  ment background checks at the time they were hired, but that\n  changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identifi\n  cation standards for both federal civil servants and contractor em\n  ployees. The Department of Commerce mandated that contract em\n  ployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard\n  background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquir\n  ies (NACI), by October 2007. NASA modified its contract with Cal\n  Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that em\n  ployees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be de\n  nied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.\n    The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins\n  with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form\n  85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF–85)). SF–85\n  asks whether an employee has “used, possessed, supplied, or manu\n  factured illegal drugs” in the last year. If so, the employee must pro\n  vide details, including information about “treatment or counseling re\n  ceived.” The employee must also sign a release authorizing the\n  Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers,\n  and others during its investigation. Once SF–85 is completed, the\n  Government sends the employee’s references a questionnaire (Form\n  42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have “any\n  reason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustworthiness,” or\n2                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have “adverse information” concerning a variety of other matters. All\n    SF–85 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the\n    Privacy Act.\n       With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near,\n    respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the back\n    ground-check process violates a constitutional right to informational\n    privacy. The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunc\n    tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that SF–85’s inquiries\n    into recent drug involvement furthered the Government’s interest in\n    combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug “treatment or counsel\n    ing” question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to\n    be held unconstitutional. It also held that Form 42’s open-ended\n    questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government’s inter\n    ests in verifying contractors’ identities and ensuring JPL’s security,\n    and thus also likely violated respondents’ informational-privacy\n    rights.\nHeld:\n    1. In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred\n broadly to a constitutional privacy “interest in avoiding disclosure of\n personal matters.” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600; Nixon v.\n Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457. In Whalen, the\n Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and\n addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the\n statute’s “security provisions,” which protected against “public disclo\n sure” of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600–601, were sufficient to\n protect a privacy interest “arguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,”\n id., at 605. In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former\n President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for\n archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at is\n sue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against “undue dis\n semination of private materials.” 433 U. S, at 458. Since Nixon, the\n Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to in\n formational privacy. Pp. 8–10.\n    2. Assuming, without deciding, that the Government’s challenged\n inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance,\n that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government\n from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF–85 and\n Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject\n to the Privacy Act’s safeguards against public disclosure. Pp. 10–24.\n       (a) The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests\n at stake. Pp. 11–19.\n         (1) Judicial review of the forms must take into account the con\n text in which the Government’s challenged inquiries arise. When the\n Government acts in its capacity “as proprietor” and manager of its\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“internal operation,” Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to\ncitizens generally. The questions respondents challenge are part of a\nstandard background check of the sort used by millions of private\nemployers. The Government has been conducting employment inves\ntigations since the Republic’s earliest days, and the President has\nhad statutory authority to assess an applicant’s fitness for the civil\nservice since 1871. Standard background investigations similar to\nthose at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates\nin 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision\nto extend that requirement to federal contract employees. This his\ntory shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and\nto employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people’s\nbusiness. The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents\nare contract employees. There are no meaningful distinctions in the\nduties of NASA’s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at\nJPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA’s\nmission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer in\nvestment. Pp. 12–15.\n       (2) The challenged questions on SF–85 and Form 42 are rea\nsonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government’s\ninterests in managing its internal operations. SF–85’s “treatment or\ncounseling” question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry\nabout illegal-drug use. In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also\na reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recog\nnizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue,\nseeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to ad\ndress and overcome their problems. Thus, it uses responses to the\ndrug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor cre\ndentialing decisions. The Court rejects the argument that the Gov\nernment has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its em\nployment background questions are “necessary” or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard\nruns directly contrary to Whalen. See 429 U. S., at 596–597. Pp. 16–\n18.\n       (3) Like SF–85’s drug-treatment question, Form 42’s open\nended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employ\nees who will faithfully conduct the Government’s business. Asking\nan applicant’s designated references broad questions about job suit\nability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from\nweak ones. The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by\ntheir pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Pp. 18–19.\n     (b) In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government in\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    terests at stake, SF–85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial\n    protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec\n    ognized that a “statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted\n    disclosures” generally allays privacy concerns created by government\n    “accumulation” of “personal information” for “public purposes.”\n    Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government’s\n    collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in\n    formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo\n    sure. The Privacy Act—which allows the Government to maintain\n    only those records “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a purpose\n    authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1); requires written consent be\n    fore the Government may disclose an individual’s records, §552a(b);\n    and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo\n    sure obligations, §552a(i)(1)—“evidence[s] a proper concern” for indi\n    vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458–459.\n    Respondents’ claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s\n    disclosure bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous\n    to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But\n    that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and\n    the Privacy Act.

Roe,\n429 U. S. 589, 599–600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents\nin this case, federal contract employees at a Government\nlaboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment\nbackground investigation violate their rights under\nWhalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a\nform questionnaire that asks employees about treatment\nor counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object\nto certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ\nees’ designated references.\n   We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution\nprotects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen\nand Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por\ntions of the Government’s background check do not violate\nthis right in the present case.

L. 111–314, §3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.\n§20112(a)(1). NASA’s workforce numbers in the tens of\nthousands of employees. While many of these workers are\nfederal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed\ndirectly by Government contractors. Contract employees\nplay an important role in NASA’s mission, and their du\nties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil\nservants.\n   One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\nin Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract\nemployees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute\nof Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a\nGovernment contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for\ndeep-space robotics and communications. Most of this\ncountry’s unmanned space missions—from the Explorer 1\nsatellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today—have been\ndeveloped and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to\nNASA earth-observation and technology-development\nprojects.

At the time when respondents were\nhired, background checks were standard only for federal\ncivil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936\n(1949–1953 Comp.). In some instances, individual con\ntracts required background checks for the employees of\nfederal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.\n   The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate\nthis two-track approach to background investigations.\nIn 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission\nprompted the President to order new, uniform identifica\ntion standards for “[f]ederal employees,” including “con\ntractor employees.”       Homeland Security Presidential\nDirective/HSPD–12—Policy for a Common Identification\nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public\nPapers of the President, George W.

Office of Personnel Manage\nment (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for Non-\nSensitive Positions, App. 88–95.2\n   Most of the questions on SF–85 seek basic biographical\ninformation: name, address, prior residences, education,\nemployment history, and personal and professional refer\nences. The form also asks about citizenship, selective\nservice registration, and military service. The last ques\ntion asks whether the employee has “used, possessed,\nsupplied, or manufactured illegal drugs” in the last year.\nId., at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide\ndetails, including information about “any treatment or\ncounseling received.” Ibid. A “truthful response,” the\nform notes, cannot be used as evidence against the em\nployee in a criminal proceeding. Ibid.

The\nGovernment runs the information provided by the em\nployee through FBI and other federal-agency databases.\nIt also sends out form questionnaires to the former em\nployers, schools, landlords, and references listed on SF–85.\nThe particular form at issue in this case—the Investiga\ntive Request for Personal Information, Form 42—goes to\nthe employee’s former landlords and references. Ibid.3\n   Form 42 is a two-page document that takes about five\nminutes to complete. See ibid. It explains to the reference\nthat “[y]our name has been provided by” a particular\nemployee or applicant to help the Government determine\nthat person’s “suitability for employment or a security\nclearance.” App. 96–97. After several preliminary ques\ntions about the extent of the reference’s associations with\nthe employee, the form asks if the reference has “any\nreason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustwor\nthiness.” Id., at 97. It also asks if the reference knows of\nany “adverse information” concerning the employee’s\n“violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse of\nalcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”\n“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid. If\n“yes” is checked for any of these categories, the form calls\nfor an explanation in the space below. That space is also\navailable for providing “additional information” (“deroga\ntory” or “favorable”) that may bear on “suitability for\ngovernment employment or a security clearance.” Ibid.\n   All responses to SF–85 and Form 42 are subject to the\nprotections of the Privacy Act.

App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara\ntory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents’\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit\ngranted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713\n(2007), and later reversed the District Court’s order. The\ncourt held that portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 are\nlikely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en\njoined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d\n865 (2008).\n   Turning first to SF–85, the Court of Appeals noted\nrespondents’ concession “that most of the questions” on the\nform are “unproblematic” and do not “implicate the consti\ntutional right to informational privacy.” 530 F. 3d, at 878.\nBut the court determined that the “group of questions\nconcerning illegal drugs” required closer scrutiny. Ibid.\nApplying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF–85’s\ninquiries into recent involvement with drugs as “necessary\nto further the government’s legitimate interest” in combat\ning illegal-drug use. Id., at 879. The court went on to\nhold, however, that the portion of the form requiring\n\n——————\n  4 Respondents sought to represent a class of “JPL employees in non\n\nsensitive positions.” App. 79.

Ibid.\n   Form 42, in the Court of Appeals’ estimation, was even\n“more problematic.” Ibid. The form’s “open-ended and\nhighly private” questions, the court concluded, were not\n“narrowly tailored” to meet the Government’s interests in\nverifying contractors’ identities and “ensuring the security\nof the JPL.” Id., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held,\nthese “open-ended” questions, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF–85, likely violate respondents’ informa\ntional-privacy rights.5\n   Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc. 568 F. 3d 1028 (2009). We\ngranted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n——————\n   5 In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also challenged the criteria that\n\nthey believe the Government will use to determine their “suitability”\nfor employment at JPL. Respondents relied on a document, which had\nbeen temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur\nportedly bearing on suitability for federal employment. App. 98–104.\nAmong the listed factors were a failure to “mee[t] financial obligations,”\n“health issues,” and “mental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric\nissues.” Id., at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under the\nheading “Criminal or Immoral Conduct,” included “indecent exposure,”\n“voyeurism,” “indecent proposal[s],” and “carnal knowledge.” Id., at 98.\nThe document also stated that while “homosexuality,” “adultery,” and\n“illegitimate children” were not “suitability” issues in and of them\nselves, they might pose “security issue[s]” if circumstances indicated a\n“susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.” Id., at 102. The Court of\nAppeals rejected respondents’ “challenges to . . . suitability determina\ntion[s]” as unripe. 530 F. 3d, at 873. Although respondents did not file\na cross-petition from that portion of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, they\nnonetheless discuss these suitability criteria at some length in their\nbrief before this Court. Respondents’ challenge to these criteria is not\nbefore us. We note, however, the Acting Solicitor General’s statement\nat oral argument that “NASA will not and does not use” the document\nto which respondents object “to make contractor credentialing deci\nsions.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.\n8                          NASA v.

This Court considered a similar\nclaim in Whalen, 429 U. S. 589, which concerned New\nYork’s practice of collecting “the names and addresses of\nall persons” prescribed dangerous drugs with both “legiti\nmate and illegitimate uses.” Id., at 591. In discussing\nthat claim, the Court said that “[t]he cases sometimes\ncharacterized as protecting ‘privacy’ ” actually involved “at\nleast two different kinds of interests”: one, an “interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters”;6 the other, an\ninterest in “making certain kinds of important decisions”\nfree from government interference.7 The patients who\nbrought suit in Whalen argued that New York’s statute\n“threaten[ed] to impair” both their “nondisclosure” inter\nests and their interests in making healthcare decisions\nindependently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld\nthe statute as a “reasonable exercise of New York’s broad\npolice powers.” Id., at 598.\n  Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of “private\ninformation” to the State was an “unpleasant invasion of\nprivacy,” id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the\nNew York statute contained “security provisions” that\n——————\n   6 429 U.

This sort of “statutory or regulatory\nduty to avoid unwarranted disclosures” of “accumulated\nprivate data” was sufficient, in the Court’s view, to protect\na privacy interest that “arguably ha[d] its roots in the\nConstitution.” Id., at 605–606. The Court thus concluded\nthat the statute did not violate “any right or liberty pro\ntected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 606.\n   Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti\ntutional “interest in avoiding disclosure.” Nixon, 433\nU. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former\nPresident Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential\nRecordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695,\nnote following 44 U. S. C. §2111, a statute that required\nhim to turn over his presidential papers and tape re\ncordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at\n455–465. In a section of the opinion entitled “Privacy,” the\nCourt addressed a combination of claims that the review\nrequired by this Act violated the former President’s\n“Fourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]” rights. Id., at 455, and\nn. 18, 458–459. The Court rejected those challenges after\nconcluding that the Act at issue, like the statute in\nWhalen, contained protections against “undue dissemina\ntion of private materials.” 433 U. S., at 458. Indeed, the\nCourt observed that the former President’s claim was\n“weaker” than the one “found wanting . . . in Whalen,” as\nthe Government was required to return immediately all\n“purely private papers and recordings” identified by the\narchivists. Id., at 458–459. Citing Fourth Amendment\nprecedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in\npreserving presidential papers outweighed any “legitimate\nexpectation of privacy” that the former President may\nhave enjoyed. Id., at 458 (citing Katz v. United States, 389\nU. S. 347 (1967); Camara v. Municipal Court of City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967); and Terry\n10                        NASA v.

Since then, the Court has\nsaid little else on the subject of an “individual interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters.” Whalen, supra,\nat 599; Nixon, supra, at 457. A few opinions have men\ntioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 762–763 (1989); New York v. Ferber,\n458 U. S. 747, 759, n. 10 (1982). But no other decision has\nsquarely addressed a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy.9\n\n\n——————\n   8 The Court continued its discussion of Fourth Amendment principles\n\nthroughout the “Privacy” section of the opinion. See 433 U. S., at 459\n(citing United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435 (1976), United States v.\nDionisio, 410 U. S. 1 (1973), and Katz, 389 U. S. 347)); 433 U. S., at\n460–462 (addressing the former President’s claim that the Act was\n“tantamount to a general warrant” under Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.\n476 (1965)); 433 U. S., at 463–465, and n. 26 (concluding that the\nchallenged law was analogous to the wiretapping provisions of Title III\nof the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, notwith\nstanding the lack of a “warrant requirement”).\n   9 State and lower federal courts have offered a number of different\n\ninterpretations of Whalen and Nixon over the years. Many courts hold\nthat disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be\nsubject to a test that balances the government’s interests against the\nindividual’s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,\n712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel\nphia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v.

The Sixth Circuit has held that the right to infor\nmational privacy protects only intrusions upon interests “that can be\ndeemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” J. P.\nv. DeSanti, 653 F. 2d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The D. C. Circuit has expressed “grave doubts” about the\nexistence of a constitutional right to informational privacy.

S., at 599, 605.10 We hold, however,\n——————\n   10 The opinions concurring in the judgment disagree with this ap\n\nproach and would instead provide a definitive answer to the question\nwhether there is a constitutional right to informational privacy. Post,\nat 6–7 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). One of\nthese opinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will “har[m]\nour image, if not our self-respect,” post, at 7 (SCALIA, J.), and will cause\npractical problems, post, at 8–9. There are sound reasons for eschewing\nthe concurring opinions’ recommended course.\n   “The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not\nsit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially\nas arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties\nbefore them.” Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983)\n(opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case, petitioners did not ask\nus to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy,\nand respondents and their amici thus understandably refrained from\naddressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a\nmatter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit\nof briefing by the parties and in which potential amici had little notice\nthat the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert. 15 (“no need in\nthis case” for broad decision on “the scope of a constitutionally-based\nright to privacy for certain information”). Particularly in cases like this\none, where we have only the “scarce and open-ended” guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way, see Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), the Court has repeatedly recognized\nthe benefits of proceeding with caution. E.g., Herrera v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 390, 417 (1993) (joined by SCALIA, J.)

When the Government asks respon\ndents and their references to fill out SF–85 and Form 42,\nit does not exercise its sovereign power “to regulate or\nlicense.” Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367\nU. S. 886, 896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts\nthe challenged background checks in its capacity “as pro\nprietor” and manager of its “internal operation.” Ibid.\nTime and again our cases have recognized that the Gov\nernment has a much freer hand in dealing “with citizen\nemployees than it does when it brings its sovereign power\nto bear on citizens at large.” Engquist v.

We take the same approach here that the\nCourt took more than three decades ago in Whalen and Nixon, and\nthere is no evidence that those decisions have caused the sky to fall.\n  We therefore decide the case before us and leave broader issues for\nanother day.\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

The questions challenged by respondents are\npart of a standard employment background check of the\nsort used by millions of private employers. See Brief for\nConsumer Data Indus. Assn. et al. as Amici Curiae 2\n(hereinafter CDIA Brief) (“[M]ore than 88% of U. S.\ncompanies . . . perform background checks on their em\nployees”). The Government itself has been conducting\nemployment investigations since the earliest days of the\nRepublic. L.

Since\n1871, the President has enjoyed statutory authority to\n“ascertain the fitness of applicants” for the civil service “as\nto age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the\nemployment sought,” Act of Mar. 3, 1871, Rev.

And the particular investigations challenged in\nthis case arose from a decision to extend that requirement\nto federal contract employees requiring long-term access to\nfederal facilities. See HSPD–12, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS\nPUB 201–1, at iii–vi, 1–8, App. 131–150.\n  As this long history suggests, the Government has an\ninterest in conducting basic employment background\nchecks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and em\nployees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its\nfacilities and in employing a competent, reliable work\nforce. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Courts must keep\nthose interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line\nthrough the Government’s employment forms and to\nscrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they\ncontain.\n  Respondents argue that, because they are contract\nemployees and not civil servants, the Government’s broad\nauthority in managing its affairs should apply with dimin\nished force. But the Government’s interest as “proprietor”\nin managing its operations, Cafeteria & Restaurant Work\ners, supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. See\nBoard of Comm’rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U.

The fact that\nrespondents’ direct employment relationship is with Cal\nTech—which operates JPL under a Government con\ntract—says very little about the interests at stake in this\ncase.

The two classes of employees\nperform “functionally equivalent duties,” and the extent of\nemployees’ “access to NASA . . . facilities” turns not on\nformal status but on the nature of “the jobs they perform.”\nIbid.\n  At JPL, in particular, the work that contract employees\nperform is critical to NASA’s mission. Respondents in this\ncase include “the lead trouble-shooter for . . . th[e] $568\n[million]” Kepler space observatory, 7 Record 396; the\nleader of the program that “tests . . . all new technology\nthat NASA will use in space,” App. 60; and one of the lead\n“trajectory designers for . . . the Galileo Project and the\nApollo Moon landings,” id., at 62. This is important work,\nand all of it is funded with a multibillion dollar investment\nfrom the American taxpayer. See NASA, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The\nGovernment has a strong interest in conducting basic\nbackground checks into the contract employees minding\nthe store at JPL.12\n——————\n   12 In their brief, respondents also rely on the fact that many of them\n\nhave been working at JPL for years and that Cal Tech previously\nvetted them through standard “employment reference checks.” Brief\nfor Respondents 52–53. The record indicates that this may be wrong as\na factual matter. E.g., 7 Record 391 (“I have not been required to\nundergo any type of background investigation to maintain my position\nwith JPL”); id., at 397 (“I have never been required to undergo any type\nof background investigation to maintain my position with JPL other\nthan . . . [one] which required that I provide my name, social security\nnumber, and current address” to facilitate a “check for outstanding\nwarrants, arrests, or convictions”); id., at 356, 367, 386–387 (similar).\nEven if it were correct, the fact that Cal Tech once conducted a back\nground check on respondents does not diminish the Government’s\ninterests in conducting its own standard background check to satisfy\nitself that contract employees should be granted continued access to the\nGovernment’s facility. In any event, counsel abandoned this position at\noral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.\n16                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 2\n    With these interests in view, we conclude that the chal\nlenged portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 consist of\nreasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the\nGovernment’s interests in managing its internal opera\ntions. See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598–599; Whalen, 429\nU. S., at 597–598. As to SF–85, the only part of the form\nchallenged here is its request for information about “any\ntreatment or counseling received” for illegal-drug use\nwithin the previous year. The “treatment or counseling”\nquestion, however, must be considered in context. It is a\nfollowup to SF–85’s inquiry into whether the employee has\n“used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs”\nduring the past year. The Government has good reason to\nask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like\nany employer, the Government is entitled to have its\nprojects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will\n“ ‘efficiently and effectively’ ” discharge their duties. See\nEngquist, supra, at 598–599. Questions about illegal-drug\nuse are a useful way of figuring out which persons have\nthese characteristics. See, e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An\nUpdated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in\nthe Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Envi\nronment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated\nwith workplace productivity).\n    In context, the follow-up question on “treatment or\ncounseling” for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable,\nemployment-related inquiry. The Government, recogniz\ning that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical\nissue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who\nare taking steps to address and overcome their problems.\nThe Government thus uses responses to the “treatment or\ncounseling” question as a mitigating factor in determining\nwhether to grant contract employees long-term access to\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal facilities.13\n   This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach,\nand respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the\nGovernment’s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigat\ning factor in its contractor credentialing decisions. Re\nspondents’ argument is that, if drug treatment is only\nused to mitigate, then the Government should change the\nmandatory phrasing of SF–85—“Include [in your answer]\nany treatment or counseling received”—so as to make a\nresponse optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory\n“treatment or counseling” question is unconstitutional, in\nrespondents’ view, because it is “more intrusive than\nnecessary to satisfy the government’s objective.” Brief for\nRespondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that “treat\nment or counseling” question should be enjoined because\nthe form “appears to compel disclosure”).\n   We reject the argument that the Government, when it\nrequests job-related personal information in an employ\nment background check, has a constitutional burden to\ndemonstrate that its questions are “necessary” or the least\nrestrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a\nstandard runs directly contrary to Whalen. The patients\nin Whalen, much like respondents here, argued that New\nYork’s statute was unconstitutional because the State\ncould not “demonstrate the necessity” of its program. 429\nU. S., at 596. The Court quickly rejected that argument,\nconcluding that New York’s collection of patients’ prescrip\ntion information could “not be held unconstitutional sim\nply because” a court viewed it as “unnecessary, in whole or\n——————\n   13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern\n\nment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, “despite counseling and\nrehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita\ntion.” 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the\nActing Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or\ncounseling solely as a “mitigat[ing]” factor that ameliorates concerns\nabout recent illegal drug use. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n18                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin part.” Id., at 596–597.\n  That analysis applies with even greater force where the\nGovernment acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager\nof its internal affairs. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.\nSF–85’s “treatment or counseling” question reasonably\nseeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who\nare attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern\nment’s considered position is that phrasing the question in\nmore permissive terms would result in a lower response\nrate, and the question’s effectiveness in identifying illegal\ndrug users who are suitable for employment would be\n“materially reduced.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That\nis a reasonable position, falling within the “ ‘wide lati\ntude’ ” granted the Government in its dealings with em\nployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.\n                              3\n  The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, “open\nended questions” on Form 42 likely violate respondents’\ninformational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants’\ndesignated references and landlords for “information”\nbearing on “suitability for government employment or a\nsecurity clearance.” App. 97. In a series of questions, the\nGovernment asks if the reference has any “adverse infor\nmation” about the applicant’s “honesty or trustworthi\nness,” “violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse\nof alcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”\n“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid.\n  These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment\nquestion on SF–85, are reasonably aimed at identifying\ncapable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov\nernment’s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.\nAsking an applicant’s designated references broad, open\nended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool\nfor separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would\nbe a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nperson might not be suitable for a particular job, and\nreferences do not have all day to answer a laundry list of\nspecific questions. See CDIA Brief 6–7 (references “typi\ncally have limited time to answer questions from potential\nemployers,” and “open-ended questions” yield more rele\nvant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by\ncontrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.\n5359.\n   The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is\nillustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private\nsectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over\n1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of\nopen-ended questions in employment background checks\nappears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.\nSee, e.g., S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compli\nance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference\nChecks on Job Applicants (“Following are the guidelines\nfor conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open\nended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer”);\nM. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (“Also\nask, ‘Is there anything else I need to know about [candi\ndate’s name]?’ This kind of open-ended question may turn\nup all kinds of information you wouldn’t have gotten any\nother way”). The use of similar open-ended questions by\nthe Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in\nmanaging its operations.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Not only are SF–85 and Form 42 reasonable in light of\nthe Government interests at stake, they are also subject to\nsubstantial protections against disclosure to the public.\nBoth Whalen and Nixon recognized that government\n“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public pur\nposes” may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457–458, 462. But both deci\n20                    NASA v. NELSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions also stated that a “statutory or regulatory duty to\navoid unwarranted disclosures” generally allays these\nprivacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at\n458–459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York’s\n“security provisions” prohibiting public disclosure, turned\naside a challenge to the collection of patients’ prescription\ninformation. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600–601, 605.\nIn Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even\n“weaker” claim by the former President because the Presi\ndential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act “[n]ot\nonly . . . mandate[d] regulations” against “undue dissemi\nnation,” but also required immediate return of any “purely\nprivate” materials flagged by the Government’s archivists.\n433 U. S., at 458–459.\n  Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen\nand former President Nixon, attack only the Government’s\ncollection of information on SF–85 and Form 42. And\nhere, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information\ncollected is shielded by statute from “unwarranted disclo\nsur[e].” See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,\nwhich covers all information collected during the back\nground-check process, allows the Government to maintain\nrecords “about an individual” only to the extent the re\ncords are “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a pur\npose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1). The Act\nrequires written consent before the Government may\ndisclose records pertaining to any individual. §552a(b).\nAnd the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations\nof its nondisclosure obligations. §552a(i)(1). These re\nquirements, as we have noted, give “forceful recognition”\nto a Government employee’s interest in maintaining the\n“confidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person\nnel files.” Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,\nn. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in\nWhalen and Nixon, they “evidence a proper concern” for\nindividual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 458–459.\n                              2\n   Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue\nthat statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s disclosure\nbar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous\nto supply a meaningful check against “unwarranted dis\nclosures,” Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in\nparticular to what they describe as a “broad” exception\nfor “routine use[s],” defined as uses that are “compatible\nwith the purpose for which the record was collected.”\n§§552a(b)(3), (a)(7).\n   Respondents’ reliance on these exceptions rests on an\nincorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of\nthe Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and\nNixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory\nprotections against “unwarranted disclosures” and “undue\ndissemination” of personal information collected by the\nGovernment. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.\nNeither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is\nneeded to satisfy privacy interests that may be “root[ed] in\nthe Constitution.” Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the\nNew York statute prohibiting “[p]ublic disclosure of the\nidentity of patients” was itself subject to several excep\ntions. 429 U. S., at 594–595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the\nprotections against “undue dissemination” mentioned in\nthe opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be\nincluded in forthcoming regulations “mandate[d]” by the\nchallenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437–439\n(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the\nAct’s “facial validity” and was not considering the Admin\nistrator’s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact\nthat the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement is sub\nject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides\ninsufficient protection against public disclosure.\n   Nor does the substance of the “routine use” exception\n22                      NASA v. NELSON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrelied on by respondents create any undue risk of public\ndissemination. None of the authorized “routine use[s]” of\nrespondents’ background-check information allows for\nrelease to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859–45860, 45862\n(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.\nReg. 28307 (2010).       Rather, the established “routine\nuse[s]” consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to\ncomplete the background-check process in an efficient and\norderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving\ndisclosures to authorized New York Department of Health\nemployees that were not “meaningfully distinguishable”\nfrom routine disclosures “associated with many facets of\nhealth care”). One routine use, for example, involves a\nlimited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that\ndesignated references can “identify the individual” at issue\nand can understand the “nature and purpose of the inves\ntigation.” App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review\neach completed SF–85 to verify that all requested infor\nmation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated\nJPL employees may not “disclose any information con\ntained in the form to anyone else,” ibid., and Cal Tech is\nnot given access to adverse information uncovered during\nthe Government’s background check, id., at 207–208. The\n“remote possibility” of public disclosure created by these\nnarrow “routine use[s]” does not undermine the Privacy\nAct’s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U. S., at\n601–602 (“remote possibility” that statutory security\nprovisions will “provide inadequate protection against\nunwarranted disclosures” not a sufficient basis for striking\ndown statute).\n   Citing past violations of the Privacy Act,14 respondents\n\n——————\n  14 E.g.,\n         GAO, Personal Information: Data Breaches are Frequent, but\nEvidence of Resulting Identity Theft is Limited; However, the Full\nExtent Is Unknown 5, 20 (GAO 07–737, 2007) (over 3-year period, 788\ndata breaches occurred at 17 federal agencies).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

But data\nbreaches are a possibility any time the Government stores\ninformation. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere\npossibility that security measures will fail provides no\n“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also\ncite a portion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure\n“[t]o the news media or the general public.” App. 89. By\nits terms, this exception allows public disclosure only\nwhere release is “in the public interest” and would not\nresult in “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\nIbid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a\ndisclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario\nin which their information might be unduly disclosed\nunder this exception.15\n   In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act’s\nnondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged\nportions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an\nemployment background check, we conclude that the\nGovernment’s inquiries do not violate a constitutional\nright to informational privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605.\n                        *     *    *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n——————\n  15 Respondents  further contend that the Privacy Act’s ability to deter\nunauthorized release of private information is significantly hampered\nby the fact that the statute provides only “an ex post money-damages\naction,” not injunctive relief. Brief for Respondents 44 (citing Doe v.\nChao, 540 U. S. 614, 635 (2004) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting)). Nothing in\nWhalen or Nixon suggests that any private right of action—for money\ndamages or injunctive relief—is needed in order to provide sufficient\nprotection against public disclosure.\n24                 NASA v.

But rather than reach this con\nclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption\nthat the Constitution requires courts to “balance” the\nGovernment’s interests in data collection against its con\ntractor employees’ interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler\ngrounds. Like many other desirable things not included\nin the Constitution, “informational privacy” seems like a\ngood idea—wherefore the People have enacted laws at the\nfederal level and in the states restricting the government’s\ncollection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo\nple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they\nthink it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu\ntional right to “informational privacy” does not exist.\n   Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I\nmust observe a remarkable and telling fact about this\ncase, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents’\nbrief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the\nConstitution, does not once identify which provision of\nthe Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities\ncontains citations of cases from federal and state courts,\n2                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfederal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four\nstates, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even\nmore exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the\nGovernment Accountability Office and an EEOC document\nconcerning “Enforcement Guidance.” And yet it contains\nnot a single citation of the sole document we are called\nupon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.\nThe body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference\nto the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the\nassuredly inapposite Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558\n(2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is\nmade to argue that NASA’s actions deprived respondents\nof liberty without due process of law. And this legal strat\negy was not limited to respondents’ filing in this Court; in\nthe Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that\n“courts have grounded the right to informational privacy\nin various provisions of the Constitution,” Brief for Appel\nlants in No. 07–56424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify\nwhich ones applied here.\n   To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly\nhonest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right\nout of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pre\ntense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Re\ngrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral\nargument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first\ntime in this litigation, that the right to informational\nprivacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. That counsel in\nvoked the infinitely plastic concept of “substantive” due\nprocess does not make this constitutional theory any less\ninvented.\n   This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that\nthe Due Process Clause does not “guarante[e] certain\n(unspecified) liberties”; rather, it “merely guarantees\ncertain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of\nliberty.” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that\nthe State has deprived them of liberty without the requi\nsite procedures, and their due process claim therefore\nmust fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for\nidentifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux\n“substantive” component of the Due Process Clause—that\n“the Due Process Clause specially protects those funda\nmental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply\nrooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721 (1997) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—respondents’ claim would fail.\nRespondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim\nat issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing\nthe farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply\nrooted in our history and tradition bars the Government\nfrom ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by\nrecovering drug addicts.\n   The absurdity of respondents’ position in this case\nshould not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due\nprocess precedents, even our “substantive due process”\nprecedents, do not support any right to informational\nprivacy. First, we have held that the government’s act of\ndefamation does not deprive a person “of any ‘liberty’\nprotected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976).\nWe reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not “sig\nnificantly alte[r]” a person’s legal status so as to “justif[y]\nthe invocation of procedural safeguards.” Id., at 708–709.\nIf outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable\nthat the mere disclosure of private information does.\n   Second, respondents challenge the Government’s collec\ntion of their private information. But the Government’s\ncollection of private information is regulated by the Fourth\nAmendment, and “[w]here a particular Amendment pro\nvides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\nagainst a particular sort of government behavior, that\n4                           NASA v. NELSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment, not the more generalized notion of substan\ntive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these\nclaims.” County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,\n842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration\nin original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents’\nFourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the\nForm 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth\nAmendment “searches” under United States v. Miller, 425\nU. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does\nnot prohibit the Government from asking questions about\nprivate information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876–877 (2008). That\nshould have been the end of the matter. Courts should not\nuse the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they\ndeem unsightly in the protections provided by other con\nstitutional provisions.\n   In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu\ntional right to “informational privacy.” Besides being\nconsistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view\nhas the attractive benefit of resolving this case without\nresort to the Court’s exegesis on the Government’s legiti\nmate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and\nthe comfortingly narrow scope of NASA’s “routine use”\nregulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further\nexplanation of the incoherence of the Court’s “substantive\ndue process” doctrine in its many manifestations, since the\nCourt does not play the substantive-due-process card.\nInstead, it states that it will “assume, without deciding”\nthat there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,\nat 1.\n   The Court’s sole justification for its decision to “assume,\nwithout deciding” is that the Court made the same mis\ntake before—in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589 (1977), and Nixon v. Administrator of General\nServices, 433 U. S. 425 (1977).* Ante, at 11.

Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “It is the preferred course because it\npromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent\ndevelopment of legal principles.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, however, there is no applicable rule\nof law that is settled. To the contrary, Whalen and Nixon\ncreated an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution\ndid not contain and that today’s opinion perpetuates.\n   A further reason Whalen and Nixon are not entitled to\nstare decisis effect is that neither opinion supplied any\ncoherent reason why a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy might exist. As supporting authority,\nWhalen cited Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557 (1969), a\n\n——————\nfailure to address whether there is a right to informational privacy\ncannot be blamed upon the Government’s concession that such a right\nexists, and indeed the Government’s startling assertion that Whalen\nand Nixon (which decided nothing on the constitutional point, and have\nnot been so much as cited in our later opinions) were “seminal”—\nseminal!—decisions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. We are not bound\nby a litigant’s concession on an issue of law. See, e.g., Grove City\nCollege v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 562, n. 10 (1984). And it should not be\nthought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self\ndenying act. To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitu\ntional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the\nPrivacy Act, 5 U. S. C. §552a (2006 ed. and Supp. III), already contains\nextensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional\nimprovisation. And because Congress’s power under §5 of the Four\nteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause,\nsee City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), the United States\nhas an incentive to give that Clause a broad reading, thus expanding\nthe scope of federal legislation that it justifies. Federal laws prevent\ning state disregard of “informational privacy” may be a twinkle in the\nSolicitor General’s eye.\n6                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nFirst Amendment case protecting private possession of\nobscenity; the deservedly infamous dictum in Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), concerning the “penum\nbra” of the First Amendment; and three concurring or\ndissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated\nthat there might be such a thing as a substantive due\nprocess right to informational privacy. 429 U. S., at 599,\nn. 25. Nixon provided even less support. After citing the\nobservation in Whalen that “[o]ne element of privacy has\nbeen characterized as the individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters,” Nixon, supra, at 457\n(quoting Whalen, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward Fourth\nAmendment analysis. It “assume[d]” that there was a\n“legitimate expectation of privacy” in the materials, and\nrejected the appellant’s argument that the statute at issue\nwas “precisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amend\nment was intended to prevent.” Nixon, supra, at 457–458,\n460. It is unfathomable why these cases’ passing, barely\nexplained reference to a right separate from the Fourth\nAmendment—an unenumerated right that they held to be\nnot applicable—should be afforded stare decisis weight.\n   At this point the reader may be wondering: “What, after\nall, is the harm in being ‘minimalist’ and simply refusing\nto say that violation of a constitutional right of informa\ntional privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is\nthe same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypo\nthetical right was not violated.” Well, there is harm. The\nCourt’s never-say-never disposition does damage for sev\neral reasons.\n   1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.\nBy substituting for one real constitutional question\n(whether there exists a constitutional right to informa\ntional privacy) a different constitutional question (whether\nNASA’s background checks would contravene a right to\ninformational privacy if such a right existed), the Court\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ngets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its\nbusiness: the appropriate balance between security and\nprivacy. If I am correct that there exists no right to in\nformational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in\njudicial maximalism. Better simply to state and apply\nthe law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law in\npectore, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our\ncharter, and probably beyond our ken.\n  If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to\nsee the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion\nanalyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is\n“assumed” rather than “decided.” Thirty-three years have\npassed since the Court first suggested that the right may,\nor may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon\nthis Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.\n  2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it\nmakes no sense. The Court decides that the Government\ndid not violate the right to informational privacy without\ndeciding whether there is a right to informational privacy,\nand without even describing what hypothetical standard\nshould be used to assess whether the hypothetical right\nhas been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to\nanother of the Court’s never-say-never dispositions:\n    “[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents’] claim\n    fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\n    consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a hypothetical\n    standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is suf\n    ficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as\n    well acknowledge the right as well. Or [it] could avoid\n    the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical stan\n    dard by denying the right. But embracing a standard\n    while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and de\n    ciding this case while addressing neither the standard\n    nor the right is quite impossible.” Stop the Beach Re\n8                      NASA v.

(slip op., at 12–13).\nWhatever the virtues of judicial minimalism, it cannot\njustify judicial incoherence.\n   The Court defends its approach by observing that\n“we have only the ‘scarce and open-ended’ ” guideposts of\nsubstantive due process to show us the way.” Ante, at 11,\nn. 10. I would have thought that this doctrinal obscurity\nshould lead us to provide more clarity for lower courts;\nsurely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for\nanother.\n   The Court observes that I have joined other opinions\nthat have assumed the existence of constitutional rights.\nIbid. It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitu\ntional questions, so long as answering those questions is\nunnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented\nin the case. So in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,\n497 U. S. 261, 279–280 (1990), we declined to decide\nwhether a competent person had a constitutional right to\nrefuse lifesaving hydration, because—under a constitu\ntional standard we laid out in detail—such a right did not\nexist for an incompetent person. In Herrera v. Collins, 506\nU. S. 390, 417–418 (1993), we declined to decide whether\nit would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent per\nson, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.\nIn New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,\n487 U. S. 1, 10–15 (1988), we declined to decide whether\nthere was a constitutional right of private association for\ncertain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial\nchallenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in\nmany of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide\nwhether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could\nsucceed.

It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.\nConsider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant\nfactors alluded to in today’s opinion:\n•\t It is relevant that the Government is acting “in its\n   capacity ‘as proprietor’ and manager of its ‘internal op\n   eration.’ ” Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are\n   told neither what the appropriate standard should be\n   when the Government is acting as regulator nor what\n   the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as\n   proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on\n   the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.\n•\t History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at\n   13–14, but how much is uncertain. The Court points\n   out that the Federal Government has been conducting\n   investigations of candidates for employment since the\n   earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges\n   that extension of those investigations to employees of\n   contractors is of very recent vintage.\n•\t The contract employees are doing important work.\n   They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they\n   are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at\n   15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today’s case\n   would be different for background checks of lower-level\n   employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never\n   told.\n•\t Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)\n   constitutional because they are “reasonable,” “useful,”\n   and “humane.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation\n   marks omitted). And questions to third parties are\n   constitutional because they are “appropriate” and “per\n   vasiv[e].” Ante, at 18–19. Any or all of these adjectives\n   may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of\n   the hypothetical constitutional right to “informational\n   privacy” is evaluated.\n10                     NASA v. NELSON\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n•\t The Court notes that a “ ‘statutory or regulatory duty\n   to avoid unwarranted disclosures’ generally allays\n   these privacy concerns,” ante, at 20 (emphasis added),\n   but it gives no indication of what the exceptions to this\n   general rule might be. It then discusses the provisions\n   of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em\n   phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA’s routine\n   use regulations. Ante, at 21–23. From the length of\n   the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec\n   essary to today’s holding, but how much of it is neces\n   sary is a mystery.\n   4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits\nclaiming violations of the right to informational privacy.\nRare will be the claim that is supported by none of the\nfactors deemed relevant in today’s opinion. Moreover, the\nutter silliness of respondents’ position in this case leaves\nplenty of room for the possible success of future claims\nthat are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents\nclaim that even though they are Government contractor\nemployees, and even though they are working with highly\nexpensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov\nernment is seeking only information about drug treatment\nand information from third parties that is standard in\nbackground checks, and even though the Government is\nliable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and\neven though NASA’s Privacy Act regulations are very\nprotective of private information, NASA’s background\nchecks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully\nciting all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the\nCourt makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.\n   In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. §1983 in those\ncircuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a\nconstitutional right to “informational privacy,” lawyers\nwill always (and I mean always) find some way around\ntoday’s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant\nwill be liable not only for damages but also for attorney’s\nfees under §1988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue,\nand defendants—for whom no safe harbor can be found in\nthe many words of today’s opinion—to settle.
