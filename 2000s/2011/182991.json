Argued October 12, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011\nRespondent Moore and two accomplices attacked and bloodied Kenneth\n  Rogers, tied him up, and threw him in the trunk of a car before driv\n  ing into the Oregon countryside, where Moore fatally shot him. Af\n  terwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moore’s brother and the ac\n  complice’s girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that\n  Moore had accidentally shot him. Moore and the accomplice repeated\n  this account to the police. On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to\n  plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sen\n  tence for that offense. He later sought postconviction relief in state\n  court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of coun\n  sel. He complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his\n  confession to police in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore con\n  sidered before accepting the plea offer. The court concluded the sup\n  pression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moore’s other\n  admissible confession to two witnesses. Counsel gave that as his rea\n  son for not making the motion. He added that he had advised Moore\n  that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore\n  could be charged with aggravated murder. That crime was punish\n  able by death or life in prison without parole. These facts led the\n  state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assis\n  tance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.\n  Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective\n  assistance claim. The District Court denied the petition, but the\n  Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court’s conclusion was\n  an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of\n  Strickland and was contrary to Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279.\nHeld: Moore was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth\n2                           PREMO v.

C. §2254(d), federal habeas relief may not be\n    granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on\n    the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state-court decision\n    denying relief involves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly es\n    tablished Federal law, as determined by” this Court. The relevant\n    federal law is the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under\n    Strickland, which requires a showing of “both deficient performance\n    by counsel and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–6.\n      (b) The state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of\n    either part of the Strickland rule. Pp. 6–16.\n         (1) The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept\n    as a justification for counsel’s action that suppression would have\n    been futile in light of Moore’s other admissible confession to two wit\n    nesses. This explanation confirms that counsel’s representation was\n    adequate under Strickland, so it is unnecessary to consider the rea\n    sonableness of his other justification—that a suppression motion\n    would have failed. Plea bargains involve complex negotiations suf\n    fused with uncertainty, and defense counsel must make strategic\n    choices in balancing opportunities—pleading to a lesser charge and\n    obtaining a lesser sentence—and risks—that the plea bargain might\n    come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not\n    stronger. Failure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can cre\n    ate at least two problems. First, the potential for distortions and im\n    balance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too\n    real; and habeas courts must be mindful of their limited role, to as\n    sess deficiency in light of information then available to counsel. Sec\n    ond, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may\n    bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect be\n    cause prosecutors must have assurances that a plea will not be un\n    done in court years later. In applying and defining the Strickland\n    standard—reasonable competence in representing the accused—\n    substantial deference must be accorded to counsel’s judgment. The\n    absence of a developed and extensive record and well-defined prose\n    cution or defense case creates a particular risk at the early plea\n    stage. Here, Moore’s prospects at trial were anything but certain.\n    Counsel knew that the two witnesses presented a serious strategic\n    concern and that delaying the plea for further proceedings might al\n    low the State to uncover additional incriminating evidence in support\n    of a capital prosecution. Under these circumstances, counsel made a\n    reasonable choice. At the very least, the state court would not have\n    been unreasonable to so conclude. The Court of Appeals relied fur\n    ther on Fulminante, but a state-court adjudication of counsel’s per\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  formance under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to” Ful\n  minante, for Fulminante—which involved the admission of an invol\n  untary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment—says nothing\n  about Strickland’s effectiveness standard. Pp. 6–12.\n       (2) The state court also reasonably could have concluded that\n  Moore was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. To prevail in state\n  court, he had to demonstrate “a reasonable probability that, but for\n  counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have in\n  sisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59. Deference\n  to the state court’s prejudice determination is significant, given the\n  uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations. That court reasonably\n  could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea\n  agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.\n  The State’s case was already formidable with two witnesses to an\n  admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the in\n  vestigation continued. Moore also faced the possibility of grave pun\n  ishments. Counsel’s bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime\n  of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the con\n  fession may have been essential to securing that agreement. Again,\n  the state court’s finding could not be contrary to Fulminante, which\n  does not speak to Strickland’s prejudice standard or contemplate\n  prejudice in the plea bargain context. To the extent Fulminante’s\n  harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that\n  the state court’s prejudice determination was reasonable.

RANDY \n\n               JOSEPH MOORE \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 19, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case calls for determinations parallel in some\nrespects to those discussed in today’s opinion in Harring\nton v. Richter, ante, p. ___. Here, as in Richter, the Court\nreviews a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit granting federal habeas corpus relief in a chal­\nlenge to a state criminal conviction. Here, too, the case\nturns on the proper implementation of one of the stated\npremises for issuance of federal habeas corpus contained\nin 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), the instruction that federal habeas\ncorpus relief may not be granted with respect to any claim\na state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among\nother exceptions, the state court’s decision denying relief\ninvolves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly estab­\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” And, as in Richter, the relevant\nclearly established law derives from Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), which provides the standard\nfor inadequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment. Richter involves a California conviction and\n2                     PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naddresses the adequacy of representation when counsel\ndid not consult or use certain experts in pretrial prepara­\ntion and at trial. The instant case involves an unrelated\nOregon conviction and concerns the adequacy of represen­\ntation in providing an assessment of a plea bargain with­\nout first seeking suppression of a confession assumed to\nhave been improperly obtained.\n                             I\n  On December 7, 1995, respondent Randy Moore and two\nconfederates attacked Kenneth Rogers at his home and\nbloodied him before tying him with duct tape and throw­\ning him in the trunk of a car. They drove into the Oregon\ncountryside, where Moore shot Rogers in the temple,\nkilling him.\n  Afterwards, Moore and one of his accomplices told two\npeople—Moore’s brother and the accomplice’s girlfriend—\nabout the crimes. According to Moore’s brother, Moore\nand his accomplice admitted:\n    “[T]o make an example and put some scare into Mr.\n    Rogers . . ., they had blind-folded him [and] duct taped\n    him and put him in the trunk of the car and took him\n    out to a place that’s a little remote . . . . [T]heir intent\n    was to leave him there and make him walk home . . .\n    [Moore] had taken the revolver from Lonnie and at\n    the time he had taken it, Mr. Rogers had slipped\n    backwards on the mud and the gun discharged.” App.\n    157–158.\n  Moore and his accomplice repeated this account to the\npolice. On the advice of counsel Moore agreed to plead no\ncontest to felony murder in exchange for a sentence of 300\nmonths, the minimum sentence allowed by law for the\noffense.\n  Moore later filed for postconviction relief in an Oregon\nstate court, alleging that he had been denied his right to\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffective assistance of counsel. He complained that his\nlawyer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to\npolice in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore consid­\nered before accepting the plea offer. After an evidentiary\nhearing, the Oregon court concluded a “motion to suppress\nwould have been fruitless” in light of the other admissible\nconfession by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify.\nId., at 140. As the court noted, Moore’s trial counsel ex­\nplained why he did not move to exclude Moore’s confession\nto police:\n    “Mr. Moore and I discussed the possibility of filing a\n    Motion to Suppress and concluded that it would be\n    unavailing, because . . . he had previously made a full\n    confession to his brother and to [his accomplice’s girl­\n    friend], either one of whom could have been called as\n    a witness at any time to repeat his confession in full\n    detail.” Jordan Affidavit (Feb. 26, 1999), App. to Pet.\n    for Cert. 70, ¶ 4.\nCounsel added that he had made Moore aware of the\npossibility of being charged with aggravated murder,\nwhich carried a potential death sentence, as well as the\npossibility of a sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole. See Ore. Rev. Stat. §163.105(1)(a) (1995). The\nintense and serious abuse to the victim before the shooting\nmight well have led the State to insist on a strong re­\nsponse. In light of these facts the Oregon court concluded\nMoore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder Strickland.\n  Moore filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Oregon, renewing\nhis ineffective-assistance claim. The District Court denied\nthe petition, finding sufficient evidence to support the\nOregon court’s conclusion that suppression would not have\nmade a difference.\n  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\n4                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed. Moore v. Czerniak, 574\nF. 3d 1092 (2009). In its view the state court’s conclusion\nthat counsel’s action did not constitute ineffective assis­\ntance was an unreasonable application of clearly estab­\nlished law in light of Strickland and was contrary to\nArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). Six judges\ndissented from denial of rehearing en banc. 574 F. 3d, at\n1162.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas\ncorpus relief for persons in state custody is defined by 28\nU. S. C. §2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of\n§2254(d) states:\n       “An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim—\n       “(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       “(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un­\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n  AEDPA prohibits federal habeas relief for any claim\nadjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the\nexceptions listed in §2254(d) obtains. Relevant here is\n§2254(d)(1)’s exception “permitting relitigation where the\nearlier state decision resulted from an ‘unreasonable\napplication of’ clearly established federal law.” Richter,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nante, at 11. The applicable federal law consists of the\nrules for determining when a criminal defendant has\nreceived inadequate representation as defined in Strick\nland.\n  To establish ineffective assistance of counsel “a defen­\ndant must show both deficient performance by counsel and\nprejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 10). In addressing this standard and its\nrelationship to AEDPA, the Court today in Richter, ante,\nat 14–16, gives the following explanation:\n      “To establish deficient performance, a person chal­\n    lenging a conviction must show that ‘counsel’s repre­\n    sentation fell below an objective standard of rea­\n    sonableness.’ [Strickland,] 466 U. S., at 688. A court\n    considering a claim of ineffective assistance must\n    apply a ‘strong presumption’ that counsel’s represen­\n    tation was within the ‘wide range’ of reasonable pro­\n    fessional assistance. Id., at 689. The challenger’s\n    burden is to show ‘that counsel made errors so serious\n    that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”\n    guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.’\n    Id., at 687.\n      “With respect to prejudice, a challenger must\n    demonstrate ‘a reasonable probability that, but for\n    counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n    proceeding would have been different.’ . . .\n      “ ‘Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an\n    easy task.’ Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n    (2010) (slip op., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim\n    can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and\n    forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial [or in\n    pretrial proceedings], and so the Strickland standard\n    must be applied with scrupulous care, lest ‘intrusive\n    post-trial inquiry’ threaten the integrity of the very\n    adversary process the right to counsel is meant to\n6                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    serve. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under\n    de novo review, the standard for judging counsel’s\n    representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a\n    later reviewing court, the attorney observed the rele­\n    vant proceedings, knew of materials outside the re­\n    cord, and interacted with the client, with opposing\n    counsel, and with the judge. It is ‘all too tempting’ to\n    ‘second-guess counsel’s assistance after conviction or\n    adverse sentence.’ Id., at 689; see also Bell v. Cone,\n    535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506\n    U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an at­\n    torney’s representation amounted to incompetence\n    under ‘prevailing professional norms,’ not whether it\n    deviated from best practices or most common custom.\n    Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\n       “Establishing that a state court’s application of\n    Strickland was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the\n    more difficult. The standards created by Strickland\n    and §2254(d) are both ‘highly deferential,’ id., at 689;\n    Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and\n    when the two apply in tandem, review is ‘doubly’ so,\n    Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strick\n    land standard is a general one, so the range of rea­\n    sonable applications is substantial. 556 U. S., at ___\n    (slip op., at 11). Federal habeas courts must guard\n    against the danger of equating unreasonableness un­\n    der Strickland with unreasonableness under §2254(d).\n    When §2254(d) applies, the question is not whether\n    counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is\n    whether there is any reasonable argument that coun­\n    sel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.”\n                            III\n  The question becomes whether Moore’s counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of\nMoore’s confession to police before advising Moore regard­\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the plea. Finding that any “motion to suppress would\nhave been fruitless,” the state postconviction court con­\ncluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance\nof counsel. App. 140. The state court did not specify\nwhether this was because there was no deficient perform­\nance under Strickland or because Moore suffered no\nStrickland prejudice, or both. To overcome the limitation\nimposed by § 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to con­\nclude that both findings would have involved an unrea­\nsonable application of clearly established federal law. See\nRichter, ante, at 19–20. In finding that this standard was\nmet, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court deci­\nsion was not an unreasonable application of either part of\nthe Strickland rule.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant defer­\nence to counsel’s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude\nit would have been unreasonable to find that the defense\nattorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment pur­\nposes. Knowles, supra, at ––– (slip op., at 11); Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. Counsel gave this explanation for his\ndecision to discuss the plea bargain without first challeng­\ning Moore’s confession to the police: that suppression\nwould serve little purpose in light of Moore’s other full and\nadmissible confession, to which both his brother and his\naccomplice’s girlfriend could testify. The state court would\nnot have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.\n   Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any\nmotion to suppress was likely to fail. Reviewing the rea­\nsonableness of that justification is complicated by the\npossibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that\nwould have supported its position: The Court of Appeals\nassumed that a motion would have succeeded because the\nwarden did not argue otherwise. Of course that is not the\nsame as a concession that no competent attorney would\n8                     PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthink a motion to suppress would have failed, which is the\nrelevant question under Strickland. See Kimmelman v.\nMorrison, 477 U. S. 365, 382 (1986); Richter, ante, at 19–\n20. It is unnecessary to consider whether counsel’s second\njustification was reasonable, however, since the first and\nindependent explanation—that suppression would have\nbeen futile—confirms that his representation was ade­\nquate under Strickland, or at least that it would\nhave been reasonable for the state court to reach that\nconclusion.\n   Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an\nearly plea respond to certain basic premises in the law and\nits function. Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is\ntoo easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not\napparent to a competent attorney when actions and advice\nleading to the plea took place. Plea bargains are the\nresult of complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty,\nand defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices\nin balancing opportunities and risks. The opportunities, of\ncourse, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a\nlesser sentence, as compared with what might be the\noutcome not only at trial but also from a later plea offer if\nthe case grows stronger and prosecutors find stiffened\nresolve. A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the\nchance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea bargain\nmight come before the prosecution finds its case is getting\nweaker, not stronger. The State’s case can begin to fall\napart as stories change, witnesses become unavailable,\nand new suspects are identified.\n   These considerations make strict adherence to the\nStrickland standard all the more essential when reviewing\nthe choices an attorney made at the plea bargain stage.\nFailure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can\ncreate at least two problems in the plea context. First, the\npotential for the distortions and imbalance that can inhere\nin a hindsight perspective may become all too real. The\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nart of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial\nadvocacy and it presents questions farther removed from\nimmediate judicial supervision. There are, moreover,\nspecial difficulties in evaluating the basis for counsel’s\njudgment: An attorney often has insights borne of past\ndealings with the same prosecutor or court, and the record\nat the pretrial stage is never as full as it is after a trial. In\ndetermining how searching and exacting their review\nmust be, habeas courts must respect their limited role\nin determining whether there was manifest deficiency in\nlight of information then available to counsel. Lockhart v.\nFretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). AEDPA compounds\nthe imperative of judicial caution.\n   Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary\nfoundation may bring instability to the very process the\ninquiry seeks to protect. Strickland allows a defendant “to\nescape rules of waiver and forfeiture,” Richter, ante, at 15.\nProsecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be\nundone years later because of infidelity to the require­\nments of AEDPA and the teachings of Strickland. The\nprospect that a plea deal will afterwards be unraveled\nwhen a court second-guesses counsel’s decisions while\nfailing to accord the latitude Strickland mandates or\ndisregarding the structure dictated by AEDPA could lead\nprosecutors to forgo plea bargains that would benefit\ndefendants, a result favorable to no one.\n   Whether before, during, or after trial, when the Sixth\nAmendment applies, the formulation of the standard is the\nsame: reasonable competence in representing the accused.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 688. In applying and defining\nthis standard substantial deference must be accorded to\ncounsel’s judgment. Id., at 689. But at different stages of\nthe case that deference may be measured in different\nways.\n   In the case of an early plea, neither the prosecution nor\nthe defense may know with much certainty what course\n10                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe case may take. It follows that each side, of necessity,\nrisks consequences that may arise from contingencies or\ncircumstances yet unperceived. The absence of a devel­\noped or an extensive record and the circumstance that\nneither the prosecution nor the defense case has been well\ndefined create a particular risk that an after-the-fact\nassessment will run counter to the deference that must be\naccorded counsel’s judgment and perspective when the\nplea was negotiated, offered, and entered.\n   Prosecutors in the present case faced the cost of litiga­\ntion and the risk of trying their case without Moore’s\nconfession to the police. Moore’s counsel could reasonably\nbelieve that a swift plea bargain would allow Moore to\ntake advantage of the State’s aversion to these hazards.\nAnd whenever cases involve multiple defendants, there is\na chance that prosecutors might convince one defendant\nto testify against another in exchange for a better deal.\nMoore’s plea eliminated that possibility and ended an\nongoing investigation. Delaying the plea for further pro­\nceedings would have given the State time to uncover\nadditional incriminating evidence that could have formed\nthe basis of a capital prosecution. It must be remem­\nbered, after all, that Moore’s claim that it was an accident\nwhen he shot the victim through the temple might be\ndisbelieved.\n   It is not clear how the successful exclusion of the confes­\nsion would have affected counsel’s strategic calculus. The\nprosecution had at its disposal two witnesses able to relate\nanother confession. True, Moore’s brother and the girl­\nfriend of his accomplice might have changed their ac­\ncounts in a manner favorable to Moore. But the record\nbefore the state court reveals no reason to believe that\neither witness would violate the legal obligation to convey\nthe content of Moore’s confession. And to the extent that\nhis accomplice’s girlfriend had an ongoing interest in the\nmatter, she might have been tempted to put more blame,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot less, on Moore. Then, too, the accomplices themselves\nmight have decided to implicate Moore to a greater extent\nthan his own confession did, say by indicating that Moore\nshot the victim deliberately, not accidentally. All these\npossibilities are speculative. What counsel knew at the\ntime was that the existence of the two witnesses to an\nadditional confession posed a serious strategic concern.\n  Moore’s prospects at trial were thus anything but cer­\ntain. Even now, he does not deny any involvement in the\nkidnaping and killing. In these circumstances, and with a\npotential capital charge lurking, Moore’s counsel made a\nreasonable choice to opt for a quick plea bargain. At the\nvery least, the state court would not have been unreason­\nable to so conclude. Cf. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 664 (2004) (explaining that state courts enjoy “more\nleeway” under AEDPA in applying general standards).\n  The Court of Appeals’ contrary holding rests on a case\nthat did not involve ineffective assistance of counsel:\nArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). To reach\nthat result, it transposed that case into a novel context;\nand novelty alone—at least insofar as it renders the rele­\nvant rule less than “clearly established”—provides a rea­\nson to reject it under AEDPA. See Yarborough, supra, at\n666 (“Section 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeas\ncourts introduced rules not clearly established under the\nguise of extensions to existing law . . .[, although c]ertain\nprinciples are fundamental enough that when new factual\npermutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule\nwill be beyond doubt”). And the transposition is improper\neven on its own terms. According to the Court of Appeals,\n“Fulminante stands for the proposition that the admission\nof an additional confession ordinarily reinforces and cor­\nroborates the others and is therefore prejudicial.” 574\nF. 3d, at 1111. Based on that reading, the Court of Ap­\npeals held that the state court’s decision “was contrary to\nFulminante.” Id., at 1102. But Fulminante may not be so\n12                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincorporated into the Strickland performance inquiry.\n   A state-court adjudication of the performance of coun-\nsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to”\nFulminante, for Fulminante—which involved the admis­\nsion of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment—says nothing about the Strickland standard\nof effectiveness. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 694\n(2002) (“A federal habeas court may issue the writ under\nthe ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule\ndifferent from the governing law set forth in our cases, or\nif it decides a case differently than we have done on a set\nof materially indistinguishable facts”). The Fulminante\nprejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation,\nwhereas Strickland seeks to define one. The state court\naccepted counsel’s view that seeking to suppress Moore’s\nsecond confession would have been “fruitless.” It would\nnot have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could\nincorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a\nsubject with which Fulminante is in no way concerned.\n   A finding of constitutionally adequate performance\nunder Strickland cannot be contrary to Fulminante. The\nstate court likely reached the correct result under Strick\nland. And under §2254(d), that it reached a reasonable\none is sufficient. See Richter, ante, at 19.\n                               B\n   The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would\nhave been unreasonable for the state postconviction court\nto have found no prejudice in counsel’s failure to suppress\nMoore’s confession to police. To prevail on prejudice before\nthe state court Moore had to demonstrate “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).\n   Deference to the state court’s prejudice determination is\nall the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin plea negotiations described above: The stakes for defen­\ndants are high, and many elect to limit risk by forgoing\nthe right to assert their innocence. A defendant who\naccepts a plea bargain on counsel’s advice does not neces­\nsarily suffer prejudice when his counsel fails to seek sup­\npression of evidence, even if it would be reversible error\nfor the court to admit that evidence.\n   The state court here reasonably could have determined\nthat Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even\nif his second confession had been ruled inadmissible. By\nthe time the plea agreement cut short investigation of\nMoore’s crimes, the State’s case was already formidable\nand included two witnesses to an admissible confession.\nHad the prosecution continued to investigate, its case\nmight well have become stronger. At the same time,\nMoore faced grave punishments. His decision to plead no\ncontest allowed him to avoid a possible sentence of life\nwithout parole or death. The bargain counsel struck was\nthus a favorable one—the statutory minimum for the\ncharged offense—and the decision to forgo a challenge to\nthe confession may have been essential to securing that\nagreement.\n   Once again the Court of Appeals reached a contrary\nconclusion by pointing to Fulminante: “The state court’s\nfinding that a motion to suppress a recorded confession to\nthe police would have been ‘fruitless’ . . . was without\nquestion contrary to clearly established federal law as set\nforth in Fulminante.” 574 F. 3d, at 1112. And again there\nis no sense in which the state court’s finding could be\ncontrary to Fulminante, for Fulminante says nothing\nabout prejudice for Strickland purposes, nor does it con­\ntemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.\n   The Court of Appeals appears to have treated Fulmi\nnante as a per se rule of prejudice, or something close to\nit, in all cases involving suppressible confessions. It is\nnot. In Fulminante five Justices made the uncontroversial\n14                   PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobservation that many confessions are powerful evidence.\nSee, e.g., 499 U. S., at 296. Fulminante’s prejudice analy­\nsis arose on direct review following an acknowledged\nconstitutional error at trial. The State therefore had the\nburden of showing that it was “clear beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant\nguilty absent the error.” Neder v. United States, 527 U. S.\n1, 18 (1999) (paraphrasing Fulminante, supra). That\nstandard cannot apply to determinations of whether in­\nadequate assistance of counsel prejudiced a defendant who\nentered into a plea agreement. Many defendants reasona­\nbly enter plea agreements even though there is a signifi­\ncant probability—much more than a reasonable doubt—\nthat they would be acquitted if they proceeded to trial.\nThus, the question in the present case is not whether\nMoore was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that he would\nstill be convicted if the extra confession were suppressed.\nIt is whether Moore established the reasonable probability\nthat he would not have entered his plea but for his coun­\nsel’s deficiency, Hill, supra, at 59, and more to the point,\nwhether a state court’s decision to the contrary would be\nunreasonable.\n    To the extent Fulminante’s application of the harmless­\nerror standard sheds any light on the present case, it\nsuggests that the state court’s prejudice determination\nwas reasonable. Fulminante found that an improperly\nadmitted confession was not harmless under Chapman v.\nCalifornia, 386 U. S. 18 (1967) because the remaining\nevidence against the defendant was weak. The additional\nevidence consisted primarily of a second confession that\nFulminante had made to the informant’s fiancée. But\nmany of its details were not corroborated, the fiancée had\nnot reported the confession for a long period of time, the\nState had indicated that both confessions were essential to\nits case, and the fiancée potentially “had a motive to lie.”\n499 U. S., at 300. Moore’s plea agreement, by contrast,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nended the government’s investigation well before trial, yet\nthe evidence against Moore was strong. The accounts of\nMoore’s second confession to his brother and his accom­\nplice’s girlfriend corroborated each other, were given to\npeople without apparent reason to lie, and were reported\nwithout delay.\n   The State gave no indication that its felony-murder\nprosecution depended on the admission of the police con­\nfession, and Moore does not now deny that he kidnaped\nand killed Rogers. Given all this, an unconstitutional\nadmission of Moore’s confession to police might well have\nbeen found harmless even on direct review if Moore had\ngone to trial after the denial of a suppression motion.\n   Other than for its discussion of the basic proposition\nthat a confession is often powerful evidence, Fulminante is\nnot relevant to the present case. The state postconviction\ncourt reasonably could have concluded that Moore was\nnot prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Under AEDPA, that\nfinding ends federal review. See Richter, ante, at 19.\n   Judge Berzon’s concurring opinion in the Court of Ap­\npeals does not provide a basis for issuance of the writ. The\nconcurring opinion would have found the state court’s\nprejudice determination unreasonable in light of Kimmel\nman. It relied on Kimmelman to find that Moore suffered\nprejudice for Strickland purposes because there was\na reasonable possibility that he would have obtained a\nbetter plea agreement but for his counsel’s errors. But\nKimmelman concerned a conviction following a bench\ntrial, so it did not establish, much less clearly establish,\nthe appropriate standard for prejudice in cases involving\nplea bargains. See 477 U. S., at 389. That standard was\nestablished in Hill, which held that a defendant who\nenters a plea agreement must show “a reasonable prob­\nability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have\npleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.”\n474 U. S., at 59. Moore’s failure to make that showing\n16                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforecloses relief under AEDPA.\n                               IV\n   There are certain differences between inadequate assis­\ntance of counsel claims in cases where there was a full\ntrial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea\nwas entered even before the prosecution decided upon all\nof the charges. A trial provides the full written record and\nfactual background that serve to limit and clarify some of\nthe choices counsel made. Still, hindsight cannot suffice\nfor relief when counsel’s choices were reasonable and\nlegitimate based on predictions of how the trial would\nproceed. See Richter, ante, at 18.\n   Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate,\nand often more so, where a plea has been entered without\na full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution\ndecided on the charges. The added uncertainty that re­\nsults when there is no extended, formal record and no\nactual history to show how the charges have played out at\ntrial works against the party alleging inadequate assis­\ntance. Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty. There is a\nmost substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffec­\ntive assistance. The plea process brings to the criminal\njustice system a stability and a certainty that must not be\nundermined by the prospect of collateral challenges in\ncases not only where witnesses and evidence have disap­\npeared, but also in cases where witnesses and evidence\nwere not presented in the first place. The substantial\nburden to show ineffective assistance of counsel, the bur­\nden the claimant must meet to avoid the plea, has not\nbeen met in this case.\n   The state postconviction court’s decision involved no\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.\nBecause the Court of Appeals erred in finding otherwise,\nits judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n               Cite as: 562 U.

Argued October 12, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011\nRespondent Moore and two accomplices attacked and bloodied Kenneth\n  Rogers, tied him up, and threw him in the trunk of a car before driv\n  ing into the Oregon countryside, where Moore fatally shot him. Af\n  terwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moore’s brother and the ac\n  complice’s girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that\n  Moore had accidentally shot him. Moore and the accomplice repeated\n  this account to the police. On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to\n  plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sen\n  tence for that offense. He later sought postconviction relief in state\n  court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of coun\n  sel. He complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his\n  confession to police in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore con\n  sidered before accepting the plea offer. The court concluded the sup\n  pression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moore’s other\n  admissible confession to two witnesses. Counsel gave that as his rea\n  son for not making the motion. He added that he had advised Moore\n  that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore\n  could be charged with aggravated murder. That crime was punish\n  able by death or life in prison without parole. These facts led the\n  state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assis\n  tance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.\n  Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective\n  assistance claim. The District Court denied the petition, but the\n  Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court’s conclusion was\n  an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of\n  Strickland and was contrary to Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279.\nHeld: Moore was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth\n2                           PREMO v.

C. §2254(d), federal habeas relief may not be\n    granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on\n    the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state-court decision\n    denying relief involves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly es\n    tablished Federal law, as determined by” this Court. The relevant\n    federal law is the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under\n    Strickland, which requires a showing of “both deficient performance\n    by counsel and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4–6.\n      (b) The state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of\n    either part of the Strickland rule. Pp. 6–16.\n         (1) The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept\n    as a justification for counsel’s action that suppression would have\n    been futile in light of Moore’s other admissible confession to two wit\n    nesses. This explanation confirms that counsel’s representation was\n    adequate under Strickland, so it is unnecessary to consider the rea\n    sonableness of his other justification—that a suppression motion\n    would have failed. Plea bargains involve complex negotiations suf\n    fused with uncertainty, and defense counsel must make strategic\n    choices in balancing opportunities—pleading to a lesser charge and\n    obtaining a lesser sentence—and risks—that the plea bargain might\n    come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not\n    stronger. Failure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can cre\n    ate at least two problems. First, the potential for distortions and im\n    balance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too\n    real; and habeas courts must be mindful of their limited role, to as\n    sess deficiency in light of information then available to counsel. Sec\n    ond, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may\n    bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect be\n    cause prosecutors must have assurances that a plea will not be un\n    done in court years later. In applying and defining the Strickland\n    standard—reasonable competence in representing the accused—\n    substantial deference must be accorded to counsel’s judgment. The\n    absence of a developed and extensive record and well-defined prose\n    cution or defense case creates a particular risk at the early plea\n    stage. Here, Moore’s prospects at trial were anything but certain.\n    Counsel knew that the two witnesses presented a serious strategic\n    concern and that delaying the plea for further proceedings might al\n    low the State to uncover additional incriminating evidence in support\n    of a capital prosecution. Under these circumstances, counsel made a\n    reasonable choice. At the very least, the state court would not have\n    been unreasonable to so conclude. The Court of Appeals relied fur\n    ther on Fulminante, but a state-court adjudication of counsel’s per\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Pp. 6–12.\n       (2) The state court also reasonably could have concluded that\n  Moore was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. To prevail in state\n  court, he had to demonstrate “a reasonable probability that, but for\n  counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have in\n  sisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59. Deference\n  to the state court’s prejudice determination is significant, given the\n  uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations. That court reasonably\n  could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea\n  agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.\n  The State’s case was already formidable with two witnesses to an\n  admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the in\n  vestigation continued. Moore also faced the possibility of grave pun\n  ishments. Counsel’s bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime\n  of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the con\n  fession may have been essential to securing that agreement. Again,\n  the state court’s finding could not be contrary to Fulminante, which\n  does not speak to Strickland’s prejudice standard or contemplate\n  prejudice in the plea bargain context. To the extent Fulminante’s\n  harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that\n  the state court’s prejudice determination was reasonable.

C. §2254(d), the instruction that federal habeas\ncorpus relief may not be granted with respect to any claim\na state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among\nother exceptions, the state court’s decision denying relief\ninvolves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly estab­\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” And, as in Richter, the relevant\nclearly established law derives from Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), which provides the standard\nfor inadequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment. Richter involves a California conviction and\n2                     PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naddresses the adequacy of representation when counsel\ndid not consult or use certain experts in pretrial prepara­\ntion and at trial. The instant case involves an unrelated\nOregon conviction and concerns the adequacy of represen­\ntation in providing an assessment of a plea bargain with­\nout first seeking suppression of a confession assumed to\nhave been improperly obtained.\n                             I\n  On December 7, 1995, respondent Randy Moore and two\nconfederates attacked Kenneth Rogers at his home and\nbloodied him before tying him with duct tape and throw­\ning him in the trunk of a car. They drove into the Oregon\ncountryside, where Moore shot Rogers in the temple,\nkilling him.\n  Afterwards, Moore and one of his accomplices told two\npeople—Moore’s brother and the accomplice’s girlfriend—\nabout the crimes. According to Moore’s brother, Moore\nand his accomplice admitted:\n    “[T]o make an example and put some scare into Mr.\n    Rogers . . ., they had blind-folded him [and] duct taped\n    him and put him in the trunk of the car and took him\n    out to a place that’s a little remote . . . . [T]heir intent\n    was to leave him there and make him walk home . . .\n    [Moore] had taken the revolver from Lonnie and at\n    the time he had taken it, Mr. Rogers had slipped\n    backwards on the mud and the gun discharged.” App.\n    157–158.\n  Moore and his accomplice repeated this account to the\npolice. On the advice of counsel Moore agreed to plead no\ncontest to felony murder in exchange for a sentence of 300\nmonths, the minimum sentence allowed by law for the\noffense.\n  Moore later filed for postconviction relief in an Oregon\nstate court, alleging that he had been denied his right to\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffective assistance of counsel. He complained that his\nlawyer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to\npolice in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore consid­\nered before accepting the plea offer. After an evidentiary\nhearing, the Oregon court concluded a “motion to suppress\nwould have been fruitless” in light of the other admissible\nconfession by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify.\nId., at 140. As the court noted, Moore’s trial counsel ex­\nplained why he did not move to exclude Moore’s confession\nto police:\n    “Mr. Moore and I discussed the possibility of filing a\n    Motion to Suppress and concluded that it would be\n    unavailing, because . . . he had previously made a full\n    confession to his brother and to [his accomplice’s girl­\n    friend], either one of whom could have been called as\n    a witness at any time to repeat his confession in full\n    detail.” Jordan Affidavit (Feb. 26, 1999), App. to Pet.\n    for Cert. 70, ¶ 4.\nCounsel added that he had made Moore aware of the\npossibility of being charged with aggravated murder,\nwhich carried a potential death sentence, as well as the\npossibility of a sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole. See Ore. Rev. Stat. §163.105(1)(a) (1995). The\nintense and serious abuse to the victim before the shooting\nmight well have led the State to insist on a strong re­\nsponse. In light of these facts the Oregon court concluded\nMoore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder Strickland.\n  Moore filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Oregon, renewing\nhis ineffective-assistance claim. The District Court denied\nthe petition, finding sufficient evidence to support the\nOregon court’s conclusion that suppression would not have\nmade a difference.\n  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\n4                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed. Moore v. Czerniak, 574\nF. 3d 1092 (2009). In its view the state court’s conclusion\nthat counsel’s action did not constitute ineffective assis­\ntance was an unreasonable application of clearly estab­\nlished law in light of Strickland and was contrary to\nArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). Six judges\ndissented from denial of rehearing en banc. 574 F. 3d, at\n1162.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas\ncorpus relief for persons in state custody is defined by 28\nU. S. C. §2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of\n§2254(d) states:\n       “An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim—\n       “(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       “(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un­\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n  AEDPA prohibits federal habeas relief for any claim\nadjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the\nexceptions listed in §2254(d) obtains. Relevant here is\n§2254(d)(1)’s exception “permitting relitigation where the\nearlier state decision resulted from an ‘unreasonable\napplication of’ clearly established federal law.” Richter,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nante, at 11. The applicable federal law consists of the\nrules for determining when a criminal defendant has\nreceived inadequate representation as defined in Strick\nland.\n  To establish ineffective assistance of counsel “a defen­\ndant must show both deficient performance by counsel and\nprejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 10). In addressing this standard and its\nrelationship to AEDPA, the Court today in Richter, ante,\nat 14–16, gives the following explanation:\n      “To establish deficient performance, a person chal­\n    lenging a conviction must show that ‘counsel’s repre­\n    sentation fell below an objective standard of rea­\n    sonableness.’ [Strickland,] 466 U. S., at 688. A court\n    considering a claim of ineffective assistance must\n    apply a ‘strong presumption’ that counsel’s represen­\n    tation was within the ‘wide range’ of reasonable pro­\n    fessional assistance. Id., at 689. The challenger’s\n    burden is to show ‘that counsel made errors so serious\n    that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”\n    guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.’\n    Id., at 687.\n      “With respect to prejudice, a challenger must\n    demonstrate ‘a reasonable probability that, but for\n    counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n    proceeding would have been different.’ . . .\n      “ ‘Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an\n    easy task.’ Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n    (2010) (slip op., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim\n    can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and\n    forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial [or in\n    pretrial proceedings], and so the Strickland standard\n    must be applied with scrupulous care, lest ‘intrusive\n    post-trial inquiry’ threaten the integrity of the very\n    adversary process the right to counsel is meant to\n6                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    serve. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under\n    de novo review, the standard for judging counsel’s\n    representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a\n    later reviewing court, the attorney observed the rele­\n    vant proceedings, knew of materials outside the re­\n    cord, and interacted with the client, with opposing\n    counsel, and with the judge. It is ‘all too tempting’ to\n    ‘second-guess counsel’s assistance after conviction or\n    adverse sentence.’ Id., at 689; see also Bell v. Cone,\n    535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506\n    U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an at­\n    torney’s representation amounted to incompetence\n    under ‘prevailing professional norms,’ not whether it\n    deviated from best practices or most common custom.\n    Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\n       “Establishing that a state court’s application of\n    Strickland was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the\n    more difficult. The standards created by Strickland\n    and §2254(d) are both ‘highly deferential,’ id., at 689;\n    Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and\n    when the two apply in tandem, review is ‘doubly’ so,\n    Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strick\n    land standard is a general one, so the range of rea­\n    sonable applications is substantial. 556 U. S., at ___\n    (slip op., at 11). Federal habeas courts must guard\n    against the danger of equating unreasonableness un­\n    der Strickland with unreasonableness under §2254(d).\n    When §2254(d) applies, the question is not whether\n    counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is\n    whether there is any reasonable argument that coun­\n    sel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.”\n                            III\n  The question becomes whether Moore’s counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of\nMoore’s confession to police before advising Moore regard­\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the plea. Finding that any “motion to suppress would\nhave been fruitless,” the state postconviction court con­\ncluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance\nof counsel. App. 140. The state court did not specify\nwhether this was because there was no deficient perform­\nance under Strickland or because Moore suffered no\nStrickland prejudice, or both. To overcome the limitation\nimposed by § 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to con­\nclude that both findings would have involved an unrea­\nsonable application of clearly established federal law. See\nRichter, ante, at 19–20. In finding that this standard was\nmet, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court deci­\nsion was not an unreasonable application of either part of\nthe Strickland rule.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant defer­\nence to counsel’s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude\nit would have been unreasonable to find that the defense\nattorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment pur­\nposes. Knowles, supra, at ––– (slip op., at 11); Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. Counsel gave this explanation for his\ndecision to discuss the plea bargain without first challeng­\ning Moore’s confession to the police: that suppression\nwould serve little purpose in light of Moore’s other full and\nadmissible confession, to which both his brother and his\naccomplice’s girlfriend could testify. The state court would\nnot have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.\n   Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any\nmotion to suppress was likely to fail. Reviewing the rea­\nsonableness of that justification is complicated by the\npossibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that\nwould have supported its position: The Court of Appeals\nassumed that a motion would have succeeded because the\nwarden did not argue otherwise. Of course that is not the\nsame as a concession that no competent attorney would\n8                     PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthink a motion to suppress would have failed, which is the\nrelevant question under Strickland. See Kimmelman v.\nMorrison, 477 U. S. 365, 382 (1986); Richter, ante, at 19–\n20. It is unnecessary to consider whether counsel’s second\njustification was reasonable, however, since the first and\nindependent explanation—that suppression would have\nbeen futile—confirms that his representation was ade­\nquate under Strickland, or at least that it would\nhave been reasonable for the state court to reach that\nconclusion.\n   Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an\nearly plea respond to certain basic premises in the law and\nits function. Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is\ntoo easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not\napparent to a competent attorney when actions and advice\nleading to the plea took place. Plea bargains are the\nresult of complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty,\nand defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices\nin balancing opportunities and risks. The opportunities, of\ncourse, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a\nlesser sentence, as compared with what might be the\noutcome not only at trial but also from a later plea offer if\nthe case grows stronger and prosecutors find stiffened\nresolve. A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the\nchance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea bargain\nmight come before the prosecution finds its case is getting\nweaker, not stronger. The State’s case can begin to fall\napart as stories change, witnesses become unavailable,\nand new suspects are identified.\n   These considerations make strict adherence to the\nStrickland standard all the more essential when reviewing\nthe choices an attorney made at the plea bargain stage.\nFailure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can\ncreate at least two problems in the plea context. First, the\npotential for the distortions and imbalance that can inhere\nin a hindsight perspective may become all too real. The\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nart of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial\nadvocacy and it presents questions farther removed from\nimmediate judicial supervision. There are, moreover,\nspecial difficulties in evaluating the basis for counsel’s\njudgment: An attorney often has insights borne of past\ndealings with the same prosecutor or court, and the record\nat the pretrial stage is never as full as it is after a trial. In\ndetermining how searching and exacting their review\nmust be, habeas courts must respect their limited role\nin determining whether there was manifest deficiency in\nlight of information then available to counsel. Lockhart v.\nFretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). AEDPA compounds\nthe imperative of judicial caution.\n   Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary\nfoundation may bring instability to the very process the\ninquiry seeks to protect. Strickland allows a defendant “to\nescape rules of waiver and forfeiture,” Richter, ante, at 15.\nProsecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be\nundone years later because of infidelity to the require­\nments of AEDPA and the teachings of Strickland. The\nprospect that a plea deal will afterwards be unraveled\nwhen a court second-guesses counsel’s decisions while\nfailing to accord the latitude Strickland mandates or\ndisregarding the structure dictated by AEDPA could lead\nprosecutors to forgo plea bargains that would benefit\ndefendants, a result favorable to no one.\n   Whether before, during, or after trial, when the Sixth\nAmendment applies, the formulation of the standard is the\nsame: reasonable competence in representing the accused.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 688. In applying and defining\nthis standard substantial deference must be accorded to\ncounsel’s judgment. Id., at 689. But at different stages of\nthe case that deference may be measured in different\nways.\n   In the case of an early plea, neither the prosecution nor\nthe defense may know with much certainty what course\n10                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe case may take. It follows that each side, of necessity,\nrisks consequences that may arise from contingencies or\ncircumstances yet unperceived. The absence of a devel­\noped or an extensive record and the circumstance that\nneither the prosecution nor the defense case has been well\ndefined create a particular risk that an after-the-fact\nassessment will run counter to the deference that must be\naccorded counsel’s judgment and perspective when the\nplea was negotiated, offered, and entered.\n   Prosecutors in the present case faced the cost of litiga­\ntion and the risk of trying their case without Moore’s\nconfession to the police. Moore’s counsel could reasonably\nbelieve that a swift plea bargain would allow Moore to\ntake advantage of the State’s aversion to these hazards.\nAnd whenever cases involve multiple defendants, there is\na chance that prosecutors might convince one defendant\nto testify against another in exchange for a better deal.\nMoore’s plea eliminated that possibility and ended an\nongoing investigation. Delaying the plea for further pro­\nceedings would have given the State time to uncover\nadditional incriminating evidence that could have formed\nthe basis of a capital prosecution. It must be remem­\nbered, after all, that Moore’s claim that it was an accident\nwhen he shot the victim through the temple might be\ndisbelieved.\n   It is not clear how the successful exclusion of the confes­\nsion would have affected counsel’s strategic calculus. The\nprosecution had at its disposal two witnesses able to relate\nanother confession. True, Moore’s brother and the girl­\nfriend of his accomplice might have changed their ac­\ncounts in a manner favorable to Moore. But the record\nbefore the state court reveals no reason to believe that\neither witness would violate the legal obligation to convey\nthe content of Moore’s confession. And to the extent that\nhis accomplice’s girlfriend had an ongoing interest in the\nmatter, she might have been tempted to put more blame,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot less, on Moore. Then, too, the accomplices themselves\nmight have decided to implicate Moore to a greater extent\nthan his own confession did, say by indicating that Moore\nshot the victim deliberately, not accidentally. All these\npossibilities are speculative. What counsel knew at the\ntime was that the existence of the two witnesses to an\nadditional confession posed a serious strategic concern.\n  Moore’s prospects at trial were thus anything but cer­\ntain. Even now, he does not deny any involvement in the\nkidnaping and killing. In these circumstances, and with a\npotential capital charge lurking, Moore’s counsel made a\nreasonable choice to opt for a quick plea bargain. At the\nvery least, the state court would not have been unreason­\nable to so conclude. Cf. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 664 (2004) (explaining that state courts enjoy “more\nleeway” under AEDPA in applying general standards).\n  The Court of Appeals’ contrary holding rests on a case\nthat did not involve ineffective assistance of counsel:\nArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). To reach\nthat result, it transposed that case into a novel context;\nand novelty alone—at least insofar as it renders the rele­\nvant rule less than “clearly established”—provides a rea­\nson to reject it under AEDPA. See Yarborough, supra, at\n666 (“Section 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeas\ncourts introduced rules not clearly established under the\nguise of extensions to existing law . . .[, although c]ertain\nprinciples are fundamental enough that when new factual\npermutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule\nwill be beyond doubt”). And the transposition is improper\neven on its own terms. According to the Court of Appeals,\n“Fulminante stands for the proposition that the admission\nof an additional confession ordinarily reinforces and cor­\nroborates the others and is therefore prejudicial.” 574\nF. 3d, at 1111. Based on that reading, the Court of Ap­\npeals held that the state court’s decision “was contrary to\nFulminante.” Id., at 1102. But Fulminante may not be so\n12                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincorporated into the Strickland performance inquiry.\n   A state-court adjudication of the performance of coun-\nsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to”\nFulminante, for Fulminante—which involved the admis­\nsion of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment—says nothing about the Strickland standard\nof effectiveness. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 694\n(2002) (“A federal habeas court may issue the writ under\nthe ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule\ndifferent from the governing law set forth in our cases, or\nif it decides a case differently than we have done on a set\nof materially indistinguishable facts”). The Fulminante\nprejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation,\nwhereas Strickland seeks to define one. The state court\naccepted counsel’s view that seeking to suppress Moore’s\nsecond confession would have been “fruitless.” It would\nnot have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could\nincorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a\nsubject with which Fulminante is in no way concerned.\n   A finding of constitutionally adequate performance\nunder Strickland cannot be contrary to Fulminante. The\nstate court likely reached the correct result under Strick\nland. And under §2254(d), that it reached a reasonable\none is sufficient. See Richter, ante, at 19.\n                               B\n   The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would\nhave been unreasonable for the state postconviction court\nto have found no prejudice in counsel’s failure to suppress\nMoore’s confession to police. To prevail on prejudice before\nthe state court Moore had to demonstrate “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).\n   Deference to the state court’s prejudice determination is\nall the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin plea negotiations described above: The stakes for defen­\ndants are high, and many elect to limit risk by forgoing\nthe right to assert their innocence. A defendant who\naccepts a plea bargain on counsel’s advice does not neces­\nsarily suffer prejudice when his counsel fails to seek sup­\npression of evidence, even if it would be reversible error\nfor the court to admit that evidence.\n   The state court here reasonably could have determined\nthat Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even\nif his second confession had been ruled inadmissible. By\nthe time the plea agreement cut short investigation of\nMoore’s crimes, the State’s case was already formidable\nand included two witnesses to an admissible confession.\nHad the prosecution continued to investigate, its case\nmight well have become stronger. At the same time,\nMoore faced grave punishments. His decision to plead no\ncontest allowed him to avoid a possible sentence of life\nwithout parole or death. The bargain counsel struck was\nthus a favorable one—the statutory minimum for the\ncharged offense—and the decision to forgo a challenge to\nthe confession may have been essential to securing that\nagreement.\n   Once again the Court of Appeals reached a contrary\nconclusion by pointing to Fulminante: “The state court’s\nfinding that a motion to suppress a recorded confession to\nthe police would have been ‘fruitless’ . . . was without\nquestion contrary to clearly established federal law as set\nforth in Fulminante.” 574 F. 3d, at 1112. And again there\nis no sense in which the state court’s finding could be\ncontrary to Fulminante, for Fulminante says nothing\nabout prejudice for Strickland purposes, nor does it con­\ntemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.\n   The Court of Appeals appears to have treated Fulmi\nnante as a per se rule of prejudice, or something close to\nit, in all cases involving suppressible confessions. It is\nnot. In Fulminante five Justices made the uncontroversial\n14                   PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobservation that many confessions are powerful evidence.\nSee, e.g., 499 U. S., at 296. Fulminante’s prejudice analy­\nsis arose on direct review following an acknowledged\nconstitutional error at trial. The State therefore had the\nburden of showing that it was “clear beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant\nguilty absent the error.” Neder v. United States, 527 U. S.\n1, 18 (1999) (paraphrasing Fulminante, supra). That\nstandard cannot apply to determinations of whether in­\nadequate assistance of counsel prejudiced a defendant who\nentered into a plea agreement. Many defendants reasona­\nbly enter plea agreements even though there is a signifi­\ncant probability—much more than a reasonable doubt—\nthat they would be acquitted if they proceeded to trial.\nThus, the question in the present case is not whether\nMoore was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that he would\nstill be convicted if the extra confession were suppressed.\nIt is whether Moore established the reasonable probability\nthat he would not have entered his plea but for his coun­\nsel’s deficiency, Hill, supra, at 59, and more to the point,\nwhether a state court’s decision to the contrary would be\nunreasonable.\n    To the extent Fulminante’s application of the harmless­\nerror standard sheds any light on the present case, it\nsuggests that the state court’s prejudice determination\nwas reasonable. Fulminante found that an improperly\nadmitted confession was not harmless under Chapman v.\nCalifornia, 386 U. S. 18 (1967) because the remaining\nevidence against the defendant was weak. The additional\nevidence consisted primarily of a second confession that\nFulminante had made to the informant’s fiancée. But\nmany of its details were not corroborated, the fiancée had\nnot reported the confession for a long period of time, the\nState had indicated that both confessions were essential to\nits case, and the fiancée potentially “had a motive to lie.”\n499 U. S., at 300. Moore’s plea agreement, by contrast,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nended the government’s investigation well before trial, yet\nthe evidence against Moore was strong. The accounts of\nMoore’s second confession to his brother and his accom­\nplice’s girlfriend corroborated each other, were given to\npeople without apparent reason to lie, and were reported\nwithout delay.\n   The State gave no indication that its felony-murder\nprosecution depended on the admission of the police con­\nfession, and Moore does not now deny that he kidnaped\nand killed Rogers. Given all this, an unconstitutional\nadmission of Moore’s confession to police might well have\nbeen found harmless even on direct review if Moore had\ngone to trial after the denial of a suppression motion.\n   Other than for its discussion of the basic proposition\nthat a confession is often powerful evidence, Fulminante is\nnot relevant to the present case. The state postconviction\ncourt reasonably could have concluded that Moore was\nnot prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Under AEDPA, that\nfinding ends federal review. See Richter, ante, at 19.\n   Judge Berzon’s concurring opinion in the Court of Ap­\npeals does not provide a basis for issuance of the writ. The\nconcurring opinion would have found the state court’s\nprejudice determination unreasonable in light of Kimmel\nman. It relied on Kimmelman to find that Moore suffered\nprejudice for Strickland purposes because there was\na reasonable possibility that he would have obtained a\nbetter plea agreement but for his counsel’s errors. But\nKimmelman concerned a conviction following a bench\ntrial, so it did not establish, much less clearly establish,\nthe appropriate standard for prejudice in cases involving\nplea bargains. See 477 U. S., at 389. That standard was\nestablished in Hill, which held that a defendant who\nenters a plea agreement must show “a reasonable prob­\nability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have\npleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.”\n474 U. S., at 59. Moore’s failure to make that showing\n16                    PREMO v. MOORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforecloses relief under AEDPA.\n                               IV\n   There are certain differences between inadequate assis­\ntance of counsel claims in cases where there was a full\ntrial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea\nwas entered even before the prosecution decided upon all\nof the charges. A trial provides the full written record and\nfactual background that serve to limit and clarify some of\nthe choices counsel made. Still, hindsight cannot suffice\nfor relief when counsel’s choices were reasonable and\nlegitimate based on predictions of how the trial would\nproceed. See Richter, ante, at 18.\n   Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate,\nand often more so, where a plea has been entered without\na full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution\ndecided on the charges. The added uncertainty that re­\nsults when there is no extended, formal record and no\nactual history to show how the charges have played out at\ntrial works against the party alleging inadequate assis­\ntance. Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty. There is a\nmost substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffec­\ntive assistance. The plea process brings to the criminal\njustice system a stability and a certainty that must not be\nundermined by the prospect of collateral challenges in\ncases not only where witnesses and evidence have disap­\npeared, but also in cases where witnesses and evidence\nwere not presented in the first place. The substantial\nburden to show ineffective assistance of counsel, the bur­\nden the claimant must meet to avoid the plea, has not\nbeen met in this case.\n   The state postconviction court’s decision involved no\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.\nBecause the Court of Appeals erred in finding otherwise,\nits judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n               Cite as: 562 U.

Washington, 466 U.

Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).\nAs Moore’s counsel confirmed at oral argument, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 32, Moore never declared that, better informed,\nhe would have resisted the plea bargain and opted for\ntrial. For that reason, I concur in the Court’s judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/182991/", "sha1": "1a0e998104408ff37a137027f24ba768c896f84a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-01-19T07:35:29"}
