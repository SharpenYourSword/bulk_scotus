RICHTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u2013587.      Argued October 12, 2010\u2014Decided January 19, 2011\nIn 1994, deputies called to drug dealer Johnson\u2019s California home found\n  Johnson wounded and Klein fatally wounded. Johnson claimed that\n  he was shot in his bedroom by respondent Richter\u2019s codefendant,\n  Branscombe; that he found Klein on the living room couch; and that\n  his gun safe, a pistol, and cash were missing. His account was cor\n  roborated by evidence at the scene, including, relevant here, spent\n  shell casings, blood spatters, and blood pooled in the bedroom door\n  way. Investigators took a blood sample from a wall near the bedroom\n  door, but not from the blood pool. A search of Richter\u2019s home turned\n  up the safe and ammunition matching evidence at the scene. After\n  his arrest on murder and other charges, Richter initially denied his\n  involvement, but later admitted disposing of Johnson\u2019s and\n  Branscombe\u2019s guns. The prosecution initially built its case on John\n  son\u2019s testimony and the circumstantial evidence, but it adjusted its\n  approach after Richter\u2019s counsel, in his opening statement, outlined\n  the theory that Branscombe shot Johnson in self-defense and that\n  Klein was killed in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway, and\n  stressed the lack of forensic support for the prosecution\u2019s case. The\n  prosecution then decided to call an expert in blood pattern evidence,\n  who testified that it was unlikely that Klein had been shot outside\n  the living room and then moved to the couch, and a serologist, who\n  testified that the blood sample taken near the blood pool could be\n  Johnson\u2019s but not Klein\u2019s. Under cross-examination, she conceded\n  that she had not tested the sample for cross-contamination and that\n  a degraded sample would make it difficult to tell if it had blood of\n  Klein\u2019s type. Defense counsel called Richter to tell his conflicting\n  version of events and called other witnesses to corroborate Richter\u2019s\n  version. Richter was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n2                      HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    He later sought habeas relief from the California Supreme Court, as\n    serting, inter alia, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance,\n    see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, when he failed to pre\n    sent expert testimony on blood evidence, because it could have dis\n    closed the blood pool\u2019s source and bolstered Richter\u2019s theory. He also\n    offered affidavits from forensics experts to support his claim. The\n    court denied the petition in a one-sentence summary order. Subse\n    quently, he reasserted his state claims in a federal habeas petition.\n    The District Court denied his petition. A Ninth Circuit panel af\n    firmed, but the en banc court reversed. Initially it questioned\n    whether 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)\u2014which, as amended by the Antiterror\n    ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), limits the\n    availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously \u201cadjudicated\n    on the merits\u201d in state court\u2014applied to Richter\u2019s petition, since the\n    State Supreme Court issued only a summary denial. But it found the\n    state-court decision unreasonable anyway. In its view, trial counsel\n    was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in planning\n    a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prose\n    cution might\u2014and later did\u2014offer.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2254(d) applies to Richter\u2019s petition, even though the\n state court\u2019s order was unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the\n court\u2019s reasoning. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (a) By its terms, \u00a72254(d) bars relitigation of a claim \u201cadjudicated\n on the merits\u201d in state court unless, among other exceptions, the ear\n lier state-court \u201cdecision\u201d involved \u201can unreasonable application\u201d of\n \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by\u201d this Court,\n \u00a72254(d)(1). Nothing in its text\u2014which refers only to a \u201cdecision\u201d re\n sulting \u201cfrom an adjudication\u201d\u2014requires a statement of reasons.\n Where the state-court decision has no explanation, the habeas peti\n tioner must still show there was no reasonable basis for the state\n court to deny relief. There is no merit to the assertion that applying\n \u00a72254(d) when state courts issue summary rulings will encourage\n those courts to withhold explanations. The issuance of summary dis\n positions can enable state judiciaries to concentrate resources where\n most needed. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) Nor is there merit to Richter\u2019s argument that \u00a72254(d) does\n not apply because the California Supreme Court did not say it was\n adjudicating his claim \u201con the merits.\u201d When a state court has de\n nied relief, adjudication on the merits can be presumed absent any\n contrary indication or state-law procedural principles. The presump\n tion may be overcome by a more likely explanation for the state\n court\u2019s decision, but Richter does not make that showing here.

Richter was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the\nNinth Circuit. Pp. 10\u201324.\n      (a) That court failed to accord the required deference to the deci\nsion of a state court adjudicating the same claims later presented in\nthe federal habeas petition. Its opinion shows an improper under\nstanding of \u00a72254(d)\u2019s unreasonableness standard and operation in\nthe context of a Strickland claim. Asking whether the state court\u2019s\napplication of Strickland\u2019s standard was unreasonable is different\nfrom asking whether defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below that\nstandard. Under AEDPA, a state court must be granted a deference\nand latitude that are not in operation in a case involving direct re\nview under Strickland. A state court\u2019s determination that a claim\nlacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as \u201cfair-minded ju\nrists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of that decision. Yarborough\nv. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664. And the more general the rule being\nconsidered, \u201cthe more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in\ncase-by-case determinations.\u201d Ibid. The Ninth Circuit explicitly con\nducted a de novo review and found a Strickland violation; it then de\nclared without further explanation that the state court\u2019s contrary de\ncision was unreasonable. But \u00a72254(d) requires a habeas court to\ndetermine what arguments or theories supported, or could have sup\nported, the state-court decision; and then to ask whether it is possible\nfair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories\nare inconsistent with a prior decision of this Court. AEDPA\u2019s unrea\nsonableness standard is not a test of the confidence of a federal ha\nbeas court in the conclusion it would reach as a de novo matter. Even\na strong case for relief does not make the state court\u2019s contrary con\nclusion unreasonable. Section 2254(d) is designed to confirm that\nstate courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal\nlenges to state convictions. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that Richter demon\nstrated an unreasonable application of Strickland by the state court.\nPp. 14\u201323.\n        (1) Richter could have secured relief in state court only by\nshowing both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that\nprejudice resulted. To be deficient, counsel\u2019s representation must\nhave fallen \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 688; and there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that\ncounsel\u2019s representation is within the \u201cwide range\u201d of reasonable pro\nfessional assistance, id., at 689. The question is whether counsel\nmade errors so fundamental that counsel was not functioning as the\ncounsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Prejudice requires\ndemonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unpro\nfessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ\n4                      HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ent.\u201d Id., at 694. \u201cSurmounting Strickland\u2019s high bar is never . . .\n    easy.\u201d Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S.___, ___. Strickland can func\n    tion as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture. The question is\n    whether an attorney\u2019s representation amounted to incompetence un\n    der prevailing professional norms, not whether it deviated from best\n    practices or most common custom. Establishing that a state court\u2019s\n    application of Strickland was unreasonable under \u00a72254(d) is even\n    more difficult, since both standards are \u201chighly deferential,\u201d 466 U. S,\n    at 689, and since Strickland\u2019s general standard has a substantial\n    range of reasonable applications. The question under \u00a72254(d) is not\n    whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable, but whether there is any\n    reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential\n    standard. Pp. 14\u201316.\n           (2) The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that because Richter\u2019s\n    attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced ex\n    pert evidence, the State Supreme Court could not reasonably have\n    concluded counsel provided adequate representation.\n       A state court could reasonably conclude that a competent attorney\n    could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence ex\n    perts. Rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys\n    will be limited to any one technique or approach. There were any\n    number of experts whose insight might have been useful to the de\n    fense. Counsel is entitled to balance limited resources in accord with\n    effective trial tactics and strategies. In finding otherwise the Ninth\n    Circuit failed to \u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s chal\n    lenged conduct\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective\n    at the time.\u201d Strickland, supra, at 689. Given the many factual dif\n    ferences between the prosecution and defense versions of events, it\n    was far from evident at the time of trial that the blood source was\n    central to Richter\u2019s case. And relying on \u201cthe harsh light of hind\n    sight\u201d to cast doubt on a trial that took place over 15 years ago is pre\n    cisely what Strickland and AEDPA seek to prevent. See Bell v. Cone,\n    535 U. S. 685, 702. Even had the value of expert testimony been ap\n    parent, it would be reasonable to conclude that a competent attorney\n    might elect not to use it here, where counsel had reason to question\n    the truth of his client\u2019s account. Making blood evidence a central is\n    sue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert\n    analysis, possibly destroying Richter\u2019s case, or distracted the jury\n    with esoteric questions of forensic science. Defense counsel\u2019s opening\n    statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evi\n    dence, but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out\n    as well as hoped. In light of the record here there was no basis to\n    rule that the state court\u2019s determination was unreasonable.\n       The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inac\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                        5\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  curate account of counsel\u2019s actual thinking, since Strickland exam\n  ined only the objective reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions. As to\n  whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing ex\n  pert testimony as a response to the prosecution\u2019s, an attorney may\n  not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or\n  for failing to prepare for remote possibilities. Here, even if counsel\n  was mistaken, the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic\n  testimony until the eve of trial. Thus, it is at least debatable whether\n  counsel\u2019s error was so fundamental as to call the trial\u2019s fairness into\n  doubt. Even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecution\u2019s tactic,\n  Richter would still need to show it was indisputable that Strickland\n  required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on\n  cross-examination to discredit the witnesses, but Strickland imposes\n  no such requirement. And while it is possible an isolated error can\n  constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious, it is dif\n  ficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsel\u2019s overall per\n  formance reflects active and capable advocacy. Pp. 16\u201322.\n          (3) The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that Richter had\n  established prejudice under Strickland, which asks whether it is\n  \u201creasonably likely\u201d the verdict would have been different, 466 U. S.,\n  at 696, not whether a court can be certain counsel\u2019s performance had\n  no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been\n  established had counsel acted differently. There must be a substan\n  tial likelihood of a different result. The State Supreme Court could\n  have reasonably concluded that Richter\u2019s prejudice evidence fell short\n  of this standard. His expert serology evidence established only a\n  theoretical possibility of Klein\u2019s blood being in the blood pool; and at\n  trial, defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prose\n  cution\u2019s expert. It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab\n  lished prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other\n  conclusions of the prosecution\u2019s experts, e.g., that the blood sample\n  matched Johnson\u2019s blood type. There was, furthermore, sufficient\n  conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to Richter\u2019s guilt, in\n  cluding, e.g., the items found at his home.

Judges\nmust be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions\nfor the writ, a commitment that entails substantial judi\ncial resources. Those resources are diminished and mis\nspent, however, and confidence in the writ and the law it\nvindicates undermined, if there is judicial disregard for\nthe sound and established principles that inform its\nproper issuance. That judicial disregard is inherent in the\nopinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here\nunder review. The Court of Appeals, in disagreement with\nthe contrary conclusions of the Supreme Court of the State\nof California and of a United States District Court, or\ndered habeas corpus relief granted to set aside the convic\ntion of Joshua Richter, respondent here. This was clear\nerror.\n   Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), the availability of federal\nhabeas relief is limited with respect to claims previously\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state-court proceedings.\nThe first inquiry this case presents is whether that pro\n2                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvision applies when state-court relief is denied without\nan accompanying statement of reasons. If it does, the\nquestion is whether the Court of Appeals adhered to the\nstatute\u2019s terms, in this case as it relates to ineffective\nassistance claims judged by the standard set forth in\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). A second\ncase decided today, Premo v. Moore, post, p. ___, presents\nsimilar issues. Here, as in that case, it is necessary to\nreverse the Court of Appeals for failing to accord required\ndeference to the decision of a state court.\n\n                            I\n  It is necessary to begin by discussing the details of a\ncrime committed more than a decade and a half ago.\n\n                             A\n   Sometime after midnight on December 20, 1994, sher\niff\u2019s deputies in Sacramento County, California, arrived at\nthe home of a drug dealer named Joshua Johnson. Hours\nbefore, Johnson had been smoking marijuana in the com\npany of Richter and two other men, Christian Branscombe\nand Patrick Klein. When the deputies arrived, however,\nthey found only Johnson and Klein. Johnson was hysteri\ncal and covered in blood. Klein was lying on a couch in\nJohnson\u2019s living room, unconscious and bleeding. Klein\nand Johnson each had been shot twice. Johnson recov\nered; Klein died of his wounds.\n   Johnson gave investigators this account: After falling\nasleep, he awoke to find Richter and Branscombe in his\nbedroom, at which point Branscombe shot him. Johnson\nheard more gunfire in the living room and the sound of his\nassailants leaving. He got up, found Klein bleeding on the\nliving room couch, and called 911. A gun safe, a pistol,\nand $6,000 cash, all of which had been in the bedroom,\nwere missing.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Evidence at the scene corroborated Johnson\u2019s account.\nInvestigators found spent shell casings in the bedroom\n(where Johnson said he had been shot) and in the living\nroom (where Johnson indicated Klein had been shot). In\nthe living room there were two casings, a .32 caliber and a\n.22 caliber. One of the bullets recovered from Klein\u2019s body\nwas a .32 and the other was a .22. In the bedroom there\nwere two more casings, both .32 caliber. In addition detec\ntives found blood spatter near the living room couch and\nbloodstains in the bedroom. Pools of blood had collected in\nthe kitchen and the doorway to Johnson\u2019s bedroom. Inves\ntigators took only a few blood samples from the crime\nscene. One was from a blood splash on the wall near\nthe bedroom doorway, but no sample was taken from the\ndoorway blood pool itself.\n   Investigators searched Richter\u2019s residence and found\nJohnson\u2019s gun safe, two boxes of .22-caliber ammunition,\nand a gun magazine loaded with cartridges of the same\nbrand and type as the boxes. A ballistics expert later\nconcluded the .22-caliber bullet that struck Klein and\nthe .22-caliber shell found in the living room matched the\nammunition found in Richter\u2019s home and bore markings\nconsistent with the model of gun for which the magazine\nwas designed.\n   Richter and Branscombe were arrested. At first Richter\ndenied involvement. He would later admit taking John\nson\u2019s pistol and disposing of it and of the .32-caliber\nweapon Branscombe used to shoot Johnson and Klein.\nRichter\u2019s counsel produced Johnson\u2019s missing pistol, but\nneither of the guns used to shoot Johnson and Klein was\nfound.\n                             B\n  Branscombe and Richter were tried together on charges\nof murder, attempted murder, burglary, and robbery.\nOnly Richter\u2019s case is presented here.\n4                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The prosecution built its case on Johnson\u2019s testimony\nand on circumstantial evidence. Its opening statement\ntook note of the shell casings found at the crime scene and\nthe ammunition and gun safe found at Richter\u2019s residence.\nDefense counsel offered explanations for the circumstan\ntial evidence and derided Johnson as a drug dealer, a\nparanoid, and a trigger-happy gun fanatic who had drawn\na pistol on Branscombe and Richter the last time he had\nseen them. And there were inconsistencies in Johnson\u2019s\nstory. In his 911 call, for instance, Johnson first said\nthere were four or five men who had broken into his\nhouse, not two; and in the call he did not identify Richter\nand Branscombe among the intruders.\n   Blood evidence does not appear to have been part of the\nprosecution\u2019s planned case prior to trial, and investigators\nhad not analyzed the few blood samples taken from the\ncrime scene. But the opening statement from the defense\nled the prosecution to alter its approach. Richter\u2019s attor\nney outlined the theory that Branscombe had fired on\nJohnson in self-defense and that Klein had been killed not\non the living room couch but in the crossfire in the bed\nroom doorway. Defense counsel stressed deficiencies in\nthe investigation, including the absence of forensic support\nfor the prosecution\u2019s version of events.\n   The prosecution took steps to adjust to the counterat\ntack now disclosed. Without advance notice and over the\nobjection of Richter\u2019s attorney, one of the detectives who\ninvestigated the shootings testified for the prosecution as\nan expert in blood pattern evidence. He concluded it was\nunlikely Klein had been shot outside the living room and\nthen moved to the couch, given the patterns of blood on\nKlein\u2019s face, as well as other evidence including \u201chigh\nvelocity\u201d blood spatter near the couch consistent with the\nlocation of a shooting. The prosecution also offered testi\nmony from a serologist. She testified the blood sample\ntaken near the pool by the bedroom door could be John\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nson\u2019s but not Klein\u2019s.\n  Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination probed weaknesses\nin the testimony of these two witnesses. The detective\nwho testified on blood patterns acknowledged that his\ninferences were imprecise, that it was unlikely Klein had\nbeen lying down on the couch when shot, and that he could\nnot say the blood in the living room was from either of\nKlein\u2019s wounds. Defense counsel elicited from the serolo\ngist a concession that she had not tested the bedroom\nblood sample for cross-contamination. She said that if the\nyear-old sample had degraded, it would be difficult to tell\nwhether blood of Klein\u2019s type was also present in the\nsample.\n  For the defense, Richter\u2019s attorney called seven wit\nnesses. Prominent among these was Richter himself.\nRichter testified he and Branscombe returned to Johnson\u2019s\nhouse just before the shootings in order to deliver some\nthing to one of Johnson\u2019s roommates. By Richter\u2019s ac\ncount, Branscombe entered the house alone while Richter\nwaited in the driveway; but after hearing screams and\ngunshots, Richter followed inside. There he saw Klein\nlying not on the couch but in the bedroom doorway, with\nJohnson on the bed and Branscombe standing in the\nmiddle of the room. According to Richter, Branscombe\nsaid he shot at Johnson and Klein after they attacked him.\nOther defense witnesses provided some corroboration for\nRichter\u2019s story. His former girlfriend, for instance, said\nshe saw the gun safe at Richter\u2019s house shortly before the\nshootings.\n  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.\nRichter was sentenced to life without parole. On appeal,\nhis conviction was affirmed. People v. Branscombe, 72\nCal. Rptr. 2d 773 (Cal. App. 1998) (officially depublished).\nThe California Supreme Court denied a petition for re\nview, People v. Branscombe, No. S069751, 1998 Cal.\nLEXIS 4252 (June 24, 1998), and Richter did not file a\n6                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetition for certiorari with this Court.    His conviction\nbecame final.\n                              C\n   Richter later petitioned the California Supreme Court\nfor a writ of habeas corpus. He asserted a number of\ngrounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of coun\nsel. As relevant here, he claimed his counsel was deficient\nfor failing to present expert testimony on serology, pathol\nogy, and blood spatter patterns, testimony that, he argued,\nwould disclose the source of the blood pool in the bedroom\ndoorway. This, he contended, would bolster his theory\nthat Johnson had moved Klein to the couch.\n   He offered affidavits from three types of forensic ex\nperts. First, he provided statements from two blood se\nrologists who said there was a possibility Klein\u2019s blood was\nintermixed with blood of Johnson\u2019s type in the sample\ntaken from near the pool in the bedroom doorway. Second,\nhe provided a statement from a pathologist who said the\nblood pool was too large to have come from Johnson given\nthe nature of his wounds and his own account of his ac\ntions while waiting for the police. Third, he provided a\nstatement from an expert in bloodstain analysis who said\nthe absence of \u201ca large number of satellite droplets\u201d in\nphotographs of the area around the blood in the bedroom\ndoorway was inconsistent with the blood pool coming from\nJohnson as he stood in the doorway. App. 118. Richter\nargued this evidence established the possibility that the\nblood in the bedroom doorway came from Klein, not John\nson. If that were true, he argued, it would confirm his\naccount, not Johnson\u2019s. The California Supreme Court\ndenied Richter\u2019s petition in a one-sentence summary\norder. See In re Richter, No. S082167 (Mar. 28, 2001),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. Richter did not seek certiorari\nfrom this Court.\n   After the California Supreme Court issued its summary\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder denying relief, Richter filed a petition for habeas\ncorpus in United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of California. He reasserted the claims in his\nstate petition. The District Court denied his petition, and\na three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. See Richter v. Hickman, 521 F. 3d 1222\n(2008). The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc\nand reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. See Richter v.\nHickman, 578 F. 3d 944 (2009).\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court of Appeals ques\ntioned whether 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) was applicable to\nRichter\u2019s petition, since the California Supreme Court\nissued only a summary denial when it rejected his Strick\nland claims; but it determined the California decision was\nunreasonable in any event and that Richter was entitled\nto relief. The court held Richter\u2019s trial counsel was defi\ncient for failing to consult experts on blood evidence in\ndetermining and pursuing a trial strategy and in prepar\ning to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might\u2014and\nlater did\u2014offer. Four judges dissented from the en banc\ndecision.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas\ncorpus relief for persons in state custody is provided by 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of\n\u00a72254(d) states:\n      \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim\u2014\n      \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n8                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nAs an initial matter, it is necessary to decide whether\n\u00a72254(d) applies when a state court\u2019s order is unaccompa\nnied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been\ndenied.\n  By its terms \u00a72254(d) bars relitigation of any claim\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state court, subject only to\nthe exceptions in \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and (d)(2). There is no text\nin the statute requiring a statement of reasons. The\nstatute refers only to a \u201cdecision,\u201d which resulted from an\n\u201cadjudication.\u201d As every Court of Appeals to consider the\nissue has recognized, determining whether a state court\u2019s\ndecision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual\nconclusion does not require that there be an opinion from\nthe state court explaining the state court\u2019s reasoning. See\nChadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606 (CA3 2002);\nWright v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 278 F. 3d\n1245, 1253\u20131254 (CA11 2002); Sellan v. Kuhlman, 261\nF. 3d 303, 311\u2013312 (CA2 2001); Bell v. Jarvis, 236 F. 3d\n149, 158\u2013162 (CA4 2000) (en banc); Harris v. Stovall, 212\nF. 3d 940, 943, n. 1 (CA6 2000); Aycox v. Lytle, 196 F. 3d\n1174, 1177\u20131178 (CA10 1999); James v. Bowersox, 187\nF. 3d 866, 869 (CA8 1999). And as this Court has ob\nserved, a state court need not cite or even be aware of our\ncases under \u00a72254(d). Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8\n(2002) (per curiam). Where a state court\u2019s decision is\nunaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner\u2019s\nburden still must be met by showing there was no reason\nable basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so\nwhether or not the state court reveals which of the ele\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments in a multipart claim it found insufficient, for\n\u00a72254(d) applies when a \u201cclaim,\u201d not a component of one,\nhas been adjudicated.\n   There is no merit to the assertion that compliance with\n\u00a72254(d) should be excused when state courts issue sum\nmary rulings because applying \u00a72254(d) in those cases will\nencourage state courts to withhold explanations for their\ndecisions. Opinion-writing practices in state courts are\ninfluenced by considerations other than avoiding scrutiny\nby collateral attack in federal court. Cf. In re Robbins, 18\nCal. 4th 770, 778, n. 1, 959 P. 2d 311, 316, n. 1 (1998)\n(state procedures limiting habeas are \u201ca means of protect\ning the integrity of our own appeal and habeas corpus\nprocess,\u201d rather than a device for \u201cinsulating our judg\nments from federal court review\u201d (emphasis deleted)). At\nthe same time, requiring a statement of reasons could\nundercut state practices designed to preserve the integrity\nof the case-law tradition. The issuance of summary dispo\nsitions in many collateral attack cases can enable a state\njudiciary to concentrate its resources on the cases where\nopinions are most needed. See Brief for California Attor\nneys for Criminal Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (noting\nthat the California Supreme Court disposes of close to\n10,000 cases a year, including more than 3,400 original\nhabeas corpus petitions).\n   There is no merit either in Richter\u2019s argument that\n\u00a72254(d) is inapplicable because the California Supreme\nCourt did not say it was adjudicating his claim \u201con the\nmerits.\u201d The state court did not say it was denying the\nclaim for any other reason. When a federal claim has been\npresented to a state court and the state court has denied\nrelief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or\nstate-law procedural principles to the contrary. Cf. Harris\nv. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 265 (1989) (presumption of a merits\ndetermination when it is unclear whether a decision ap\n10                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npearing to rest on federal grounds was decided on another\nbasis).\n   The presumption may be overcome when there is reason\nto think some other explanation for the state court\u2019s deci\nsion is more likely. See, e.g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501\nU. S. 797, 803 (1991). Richter, however, does not make\nthat showing. He mentions the theoretical possibility that\nthe members of the California Supreme Court may not\nhave agreed on the reasons for denying his petition. It is\npure speculation, however, to suppose that happened in\nthis case. And Richter\u2019s assertion that the mere possibil\nity of a lack of agreement prevents any attribution of\nreasons to the state court\u2019s decision is foreclosed by prece\ndent. See ibid.\n   As has been noted before, the California courts or Legis\nlature can alter the State\u2019s practices or elaborate more\nfully on their import. See Evans v. Chavis, 546 U. S. 189,\n197, 199 (2006). But that has not occurred here. This\nCourt now holds and reconfirms that \u00a72254(d) does not\nrequire a state court to give reasons before its decision can\nbe deemed to have been \u201cadjudicated on the merits.\u201d\nRichter has failed to show that the California Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision did not involve a determination of the\nmerits of his claim. Section 2254(d) applies to his petition.\n                             III\n  Federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims\nsubject to \u00a72254(d) unless it is shown that the earlier state\ncourt\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to\u201d federal law then clearly\nestablished in the holdings of this Court, \u00a72254(d)(1);\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.

In the view of the Court of\nAppeals, the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Rich\nter\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim unreasonably applied the\nholding in Strickland. The Court of Appeals\u2019 lengthy\nopinion, however, discloses an improper understanding of\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s unreasonableness standard and of its operation\nin the context of a Strickland claim.\n  The pivotal question is whether the state court\u2019s appli\ncation of the Strickland standard was unreasonable. This\nis different from asking whether defense counsel\u2019s per\nformance fell below Strickland\u2019s standard. Were that the\ninquiry, the analysis would be no different than if, for\nexample, this Court were adjudicating a Strickland claim\non direct review of a criminal conviction in a United States\ndistrict court. Under AEDPA, though, it is a necessary\npremise that the two questions are different. For purposes\nof \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201can unreasonable application of federal law\nis different from an incorrect application of federal law.\u201d\nWilliams, supra, at 410. A state court must be granted a\ndeference and latitude that are not in operation when the\ncase involves review under the Strickland standard itself.\n  A state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit\nprecludes federal habeas relief so long as \u201cfairminded\njurists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of the state\ncourt\u2019s decision. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,\n664 (2004).        And as this Court has explained,\n\u201c[E]valuating whether a rule application was unreason\nable requires considering the rule\u2019s specificity. The more\ngeneral the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching\noutcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[I]t is\nnot an unreasonable application of clearly established\nFederal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific\nlegal rule that has not been squarely established by this\n12               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt.\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 9\u201310) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here it is not apparent how the Court of Appeals\u2019 analy\nsis would have been any different without AEDPA. The\ncourt explicitly conducted a de novo review, 578 F. 3d, at\n952; and after finding a Strickland violation, it declared,\nwithout further explanation, that the \u201cstate court\u2019s deci\nsion to the contrary constituted an unreasonable applica\ntion of Strickland.\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 969. AEDPA demands\nmore. Under \u00a72254(d), a habeas court must determine\nwhat arguments or theories supported or, as here, could\nhave supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then it\nmust ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could\ndisagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent\nwith the holding in a prior decision of this Court. The\nopinion of the Court of Appeals all but ignored \u201cthe only\nquestion that matters under \u00a72254(d)(1).\u201d Lockyer v.\nAndrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71 (2003).\n   The Court of Appeals appears to have treated the un\nreasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the\nresult it would reach under de novo review: Because the\nCourt of Appeals had little doubt that Richter\u2019s Strickland\nclaim had merit, the Court of Appeals concluded the state\ncourt must have been unreasonable in rejecting it. This\nanalysis overlooks arguments that would otherwise justify\nthe state court\u2019s result and ignores further limitations of\n\u00a72254(d), including its requirement that the state court\u2019s\ndecision be evaluated according to the precedents of this\nCourt. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 11\u201312). It bears repeating that even a strong case\nfor relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclu\nsion was unreasonable. See Lockyer, supra, at 75.\n   If this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it\nwas meant to be. As amended by AEDPA, \u00a72254(d) stops\nshort of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitiga\ntion of claims already rejected in state proceedings. Cf.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

S. 651, 664 (1996) (discussing\nAEDPA\u2019s \u201cmodified res judicata rule\u201d under \u00a72244). It\npreserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there\nis no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the\nstate court\u2019s decision conflicts with this Court\u2019s prece\ndents. It goes no farther. Section 2254(d) reflects the view\nthat habeas corpus is a \u201cguard against extreme malfunc\ntions in the state criminal justice systems,\u201d not a substi\ntute for ordinary error correction through appeal. Jackson\nv. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). As a condition for obtaining\nhabeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner must\nshow that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being pre\nsented in federal court was so lacking in justification that\nthere was an error well understood and comprehended in\nexisting law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis\nagreement.\n   The reasons for this approach are familiar. \u201cFederal\nhabeas review of state convictions frustrates both the\nStates\u2019 sovereign power to punish offenders and their\ngood-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.\u201d\nCalderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555\u2013556 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It \u201cdisturbs the\nState\u2019s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga\ntion, denies society the right to punish some admitted\noffenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree\nmatched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\u201d\nReed, 489 U. S., at 282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal\nhabeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts\nare the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal\nlenges to state convictions. Under the exhaustion re\nquirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state convic\ntion must first attempt to present his claim in state court.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b). If the state court rejects the claim on\nprocedural grounds, the claim is barred in federal court\n14               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunless one of the exceptions to the doctrine of Wainwright\nv. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82\u201384 (1977), applies. And if the\nstate court denies the claim on the merits, the claim is\nbarred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to\n\u00a72254(d) set out in \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and (2) applies. Section\n2254(d) thus complements the exhaustion requirement\nand the doctrine of procedural bar to ensure that state\nproceedings are the central process, not just a preliminary\nstep for a later federal habeas proceeding, see id., at 90.\n   Here, however, the Court of Appeals gave \u00a72254(d) no\noperation or function in its reasoning. Its analysis illus\ntrates a lack of deference to the state court\u2019s determina\ntion and an improper intervention in state criminal proc\nesses, contrary to the purpose and mandate of AEDPA and\nto the now well-settled meaning and function of habeas\ncorpus in the federal system.\n                             IV\n  The conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Richter\ndemonstrated an unreasonable application by the state\ncourt of the Strickland standard now must be discussed.\nTo have been entitled to relief from the California Su\npreme Court, Richter had to show both that his counsel\nprovided deficient assistance and that there was prejudice\nas a result.\n  To establish deficient performance, a person challenging\na conviction must show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U. S.,\nat 688. A court considering a claim of ineffective assis\ntance must apply a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation was within the \u201cwide range\u201d of reasonable\nprofessional assistance. Id., at 689.

Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as\na way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise\nissues not presented at trial, and so the Strickland stan\ndard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest \u201cintrusive\npost-trial inquiry\u201d threaten the integrity of the very ad\nversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 689\u2013690. Even under de novo\nreview, the standard for judging counsel\u2019s representation\nis a most deferential one. Unlike a later reviewing court,\nthe attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of\nmaterials outside the record, and interacted with the\nclient, with opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is \u201call\ntoo tempting\u201d to \u201csecond-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after\nconviction or adverse sentence.\u201d Id., at 689; see also Bell\nv. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell,\n506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an\nattorney\u2019s representation amounted to incompetence\nunder \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d not whether it\ndeviated from best practices or most common custom.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\n   Establishing that a state court\u2019s application of Strick\nland was unreasonable under \u00a72254(d) is all the more\ndifficult.   The standards created by Strickland and\n\u00a72254(d) are both \u201chighly deferential,\u201d id., at 689; Lindh v.\nMurphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and when the two\n16                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napply in tandem, review is \u201cdoubly\u201d so, Knowles, 556 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strickland standard is a gen\neral one, so the range of reasonable applications is sub\nstantial. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Federal habeas\ncourts must guard against the danger of equating unrea\nsonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness\nunder \u00a72254(d). When \u00a72254(d) applies, the question is\nnot whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The ques\ntion is whether there is any reasonable argument that\ncounsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\n                              A\n  With respect to defense counsel\u2019s performance, the\nCourt of Appeals held that because Richter\u2019s attorney had\nnot consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert\nevidence, the California Supreme Court could not rea\nsonably have concluded counsel provided adequate repre\nsentation. This conclusion was erroneous.\n                              1\n   The Court of Appeals first held that Richter\u2019s attorney\nrendered constitutionally deficient service because he did\nnot consult blood evidence experts in developing the basic\nstrategy for Richter\u2019s defense or offer their testimony as\npart of the principal case for the defense. Strickland,\nhowever, permits counsel to \u201cmake a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 691. It was at least arguable that a reasonable\nattorney could decide to forgo inquiry into the blood evi\ndence in the circumstances here.\n   Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and\navailable defense strategy requires consultation with\nexperts or introduction of expert evidence, whether pre\ntrial, at trial, or both. There are, however, \u201ccountless\nways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\nEven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na particular client in the same way.\u201d Id., at 689. Rare are\nthe situations in which the \u201cwide latitude counsel must\nhave in making tactical decisions\u201d will be limited to any\none technique or approach. Ibid. It can be assumed that\nin some cases counsel would be deemed ineffective for\nfailing to consult or rely on experts, but even that formula\ntion is sufficiently general that state courts would have\nwide latitude in applying it. Here it would be well within\nthe bounds of a reasonable judicial determination for the\nstate court to conclude that defense counsel could follow a\nstrategy that did not require the use of experts regarding\nthe pool in the doorway to Johnson\u2019s bedroom.\n   From the perspective of Richter\u2019s defense counsel when\nhe was preparing Richter\u2019s defense, there were any num\nber of hypothetical experts\u2014specialists in psychiatry,\npsychology, ballistics, fingerprints, tire treads, physiology,\nor numerous other disciplines and subdisciplines\u2014whose\ninsight might possibly have been useful. An attorney can\navoid activities that appear \u201cdistractive from more impor\ntant duties.\u201d Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 8). Counsel was entitled to for\nmulate a strategy that was reasonable at the time and to\nbalance limited resources in accord with effective trial\ntactics and strategies. See Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14\u201315); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 383 (2005);\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 525 (2003); Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 699.\n   In concluding otherwise the Court of Appeals failed to\n\u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged\nconduct\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s per\nspective at the time.\u201d Id., at 689. In its view Klein\u2019s\nlocation was \u201cthe single most critical issue in the case\u201d\ngiven the differing theories of the prosecution and the\ndefense, and the source of the blood in the doorway was\ntherefore of central concern. 578 F. 3d, at 953\u2013954. But it\nwas far from a necessary conclusion that this was evident\n18               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the trial. There were many factual differ\nences between prosecution and defense versions of the\nevents on the night of the shootings. It is only because\nforensic evidence has emerged concerning the source of the\nblood pool that the issue could with any plausibility be\nsaid to stand apart. Reliance on \u201cthe harsh light of hind\nsight\u201d to cast doubt on a trial that took place now more\nthan 15 years ago is precisely what Strickland and\nAEDPA seek to prevent. Cone, 535 U. S., at 702; see also\nLockhart, 506 U. S., at 372.\n  Even if it had been apparent that expert blood testi\nmony could support Richter\u2019s defense, it would be reason\nable to conclude that a competent attorney might elect not\nto use it. The Court of Appeals opinion for the en banc\nmajority rests in large part on a hypothesis that reasona\nbly could have been rejected. The hypothesis is that with\nout jeopardizing Richter\u2019s defense, an expert could have\ntestified that the blood in Johnson\u2019s doorway could not\nhave come from Johnson and could have come from Klein,\nthus suggesting that Richter\u2019s version of the shooting was\ncorrect and Johnson\u2019s a fabrication. This theory overlooks\nthe fact that concentrating on the blood pool carried its\nown serious risks. If serological analysis or other forensic\nevidence demonstrated that the blood came from Johnson\nalone, Richter\u2019s story would be exposed as an invention.\nAn attorney need not pursue an investigation that would\nbe fruitless, much less one that might be harmful to the\ndefense. Strickland, supra, at 691. Here Richter\u2019s attor\nney had reason to question the truth of his client\u2019s ac\ncount, given, for instance, Richter\u2019s initial denial of\ninvolvement and the subsequent production of Johnson\u2019s\nmissing pistol.\n  It would have been altogether reasonable to conclude\nthat this concern justified the course Richter\u2019s counsel\npursued. Indeed, the Court of Appeals recognized this risk\ninsofar as it pertained to the suggestion that counsel\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould have had the blood evidence tested. 578 F. 3d, at\n956, n. 9. But the court failed to recognize that making a\ncentral issue out of blood evidence would have increased\nthe likelihood of the prosecution\u2019s producing its own evi\ndence on the blood pool\u2019s origins and composition; and\nonce matters proceeded on this course, there was a serious\nrisk that expert evidence could destroy Richter\u2019s case.\nEven apart from this danger, there was the possibility\nthat expert testimony could shift attention to esoteric\nmatters of forensic science, distract the jury from whether\nJohnson was telling the truth, or transform the case into a\nbattle of the experts. Accord, Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F. 3d\n815, 836 (CA9 1995).\n   True, it appears that defense counsel\u2019s opening state\nment itself inspired the prosecution to introduce expert\nforensic evidence. But the prosecution\u2019s evidence may\nwell have been weakened by the fact that it was assem\nbled late in the process; and in any event the prosecution\u2019s\nresponse shows merely that the defense strategy did not\nwork out as well as counsel had hoped, not that counsel\nwas incompetent.\n   To support a defense argument that the prosecution has\nnot proved its case it sometimes is better to try to cast\npervasive suspicion of doubt than to strive to prove a\ncertainty that exonerates. All that happened here is that\ncounsel pursued a course that conformed to the first op\ntion. If this case presented a de novo review of Strickland,\nthe foregoing might well suffice to reject the claim of\ninadequate counsel, but that is an unnecessary step. The\nCourt of Appeals must be reversed if there was a reason\nable justification for the state court\u2019s decision. In light of\nthe record here there was no basis to rule that the state\ncourt\u2019s determination was unreasonable.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing strategic\nconsiderations like these as an inaccurate account of\ncounsel\u2019s actual thinking. Although courts may not in\n20                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndulge \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d for counsel\u2019s decisionmak\ning that contradicts the available evidence of counsel\u2019s\nactions, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 526\u2013527, neither may they\ninsist counsel confirm every aspect of the strategic basis\nfor his or her actions. There is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d\nthat counsel\u2019s attention to certain issues to the exclusion\nof others reflects trial tactics rather than \u201csheer neglect.\u201d\nYarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 8 (2003) (per curiam).\nAfter an adverse verdict at trial even the most experienced\ncounsel may find it difficult to resist asking whether a\ndifferent strategy might have been better, and, in the\ncourse of that reflection, to magnify their own responsibil\nity for an unfavorable outcome. Strickland, however, calls\nfor an inquiry into the objective reasonableness of coun\nsel\u2019s performance, not counsel\u2019s subjective state of mind.\n466 U. S., at 688.\n                              2\n   The Court of Appeals also found that Richter\u2019s attorney\nwas constitutionally deficient because he had not expected\nthe prosecution to offer expert testimony and therefore\nwas unable to offer expert testimony of his own in re\nsponse.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in suggesting counsel had\nto be prepared for \u201cany contingency,\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 946\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        Strickland does\nnot guarantee perfect representation, only a \u201c \u2018reasonably\ncompetent attorney.\u2019 \u201d 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann\nv. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 770 (1970)); see also Gentry,\nsupra, at 7. Representation is constitutionally ineffective\nonly if it \u201cso undermined the proper functioning of the\nadversarial process\u201d that the defendant was denied a fair\ntrial. Strickland, supra, at 686. Just as there is no expec\ntation that competent counsel will be a flawless strategist\nor tactician, an attorney may not be faulted for a reason\nable miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprepare for what appear to be remote possibilities.\n   Here, Richter\u2019s attorney was mistaken in thinking the\nprosecution would not present forensic testimony. But the\nprosecution itself did not expect to make that presenta-\ntion and had made no preparations for doing so on the eve\nof trial. For this reason alone, it is at least debatable\nwhether counsel\u2019s error was so fundamental as to call the\nfairness of the trial into doubt.\n   Even if counsel should have foreseen that the prosecu\ntion would offer expert evidence, Richter would still need\nto show it was indisputable that Strickland required his\nattorney to act upon that knowledge. Attempting to estab\nlish this, the Court of Appeals held that defense counsel\nshould have offered expert testimony to rebut the evidence\nfrom the prosecution. But Strickland does not enact New\nton\u2019s third law for the presentation of evidence, requiring\nfor every prosecution expert an equal and opposite expert\nfrom the defense.\n   In many instances cross-examination will be sufficient\nto expose defects in an expert\u2019s presentation. When de\nfense counsel does not have a solid case, the best strategy\ncan be to say that there is too much doubt about the\nState\u2019s theory for a jury to convict. And while in some\ninstances \u201ceven an isolated error\u201d can support an ineffec\ntive-assistance claim if it is \u201csufficiently egregious and\nprejudicial,\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986),\nit is difficult to establish ineffective assistance when coun\nsel\u2019s overall performance indicates active and capable\nadvocacy. Here Richter\u2019s attorney represented him with\nvigor and conducted a skillful cross-examination. As\nnoted, defense counsel elicited concessions from the State\u2019s\nexperts and was able to draw attention to weaknesses in\ntheir conclusions stemming from the fact that their analy\nses were conducted long after investigators had left the\ncrime scene. For all of these reasons, it would have been\nreasonable to find that Richter had not shown his attorney\n22               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas deficient under Strickland.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals further concluded that Richter had\nestablished prejudice under Strickland given the expert\nevidence his attorney could have introduced. It held that\nthe California Supreme Court would have been unreason\nable in concluding otherwise. This too was error.\n   In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is\nnot whether a court can be certain counsel\u2019s performance\nhad no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible a\nreasonable doubt might have been established if counsel\nacted differently. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13); Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 693. Instead, Strickland asks whether it is \u201crea\nsonably likely\u201d the result would have been different. Id.,\nat 696. This does not require a showing that counsel\u2019s\nactions \u201cmore likely than not altered the outcome,\u201d but the\ndifference between Strickland\u2019s prejudice standard and a\nmore-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters\n\u201conly in the rarest case.\u201d Id., at 693, 697. The likelihood\nof a different result must be substantial, not just conceiv\nable. Id., at 693.\n   It would not have been unreasonable for the California\nSupreme Court to conclude Richter\u2019s evidence of prejudice\nfell short of this standard. His expert serology evidence\nestablished nothing more than a theoretical possibility\nthat, in addition to blood of Johnson\u2019s type, Klein\u2019s blood\nmay also have been present in a blood sample taken near\nthe bedroom doorway pool. At trial, defense counsel ex\ntracted a concession along these lines from the prosecu\ntion\u2019s expert. The pathology expert\u2019s claim about the size\nof the blood pool could be taken to suggest only that the\nwounded and hysterical Johnson erred in his assessment\nof time or that he bled more profusely than estimated.\nAnd the analysis of the purported blood pattern expert\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindicated no more than that Johnson was not standing up\nwhen the blood pool formed.\n   It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab\nlished prejudice given that he offered no evidence directly\nchallenging other conclusions reached by the prosecution\u2019s\nexperts. For example, there was no dispute that the blood\nsample taken near the doorway pool matched Johnson\u2019s\nblood type. The California Supreme Court reasonably\ncould have concluded that testimony about patterns that\nform when blood drips to the floor or about the rate at\nwhich Johnson was bleeding did not undermine the re\nsults of chemical tests indicating blood type. Nor did\nRichter provide any direct refutation of the State\u2019s expert\ntestimony describing how blood spatter near the couch\nsuggested a shooting in the living room and how the blood\npatterns on Klein\u2019s face were inconsistent with Richter\u2019s\ntheory that Klein had been killed in the bedroom doorway\nand moved to the couch.\n   There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circum\nstantial evidence pointing to Richter\u2019s guilt. It included\nthe gun safe and ammunition found at his home; his flight\nfrom the crime scene; his disposal of the .32-caliber gun\nand of Johnson\u2019s pistol; his shifting story concerning his\ninvolvement; the disappearance prior to the arrival of the\nlaw enforcement officers of the .22-caliber weapon that\nkilled Klein; the improbability of Branscombe\u2019s not being\nwounded in the shootout that resulted in a combined four\nbullet wounds to Johnson and Klein; and the difficulties\nthe intoxicated and twice-shot Johnson would have had in\ncarrying the body of a dying man from bedroom doorway\nto living room couch, not to mention the lack of any obvi\nous reason for him to do so. There was ample basis for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to think any real possibility of\nRichter\u2019s being acquitted was eclipsed by the remaining\nevidence pointing to guilt.\n24               HARRINGTON v.

RICHTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u2013587.      Argued October 12, 2010\u2014Decided January 19, 2011\nIn 1994, deputies called to drug dealer Johnson\u2019s California home found\n  Johnson wounded and Klein fatally wounded. Johnson claimed that\n  he was shot in his bedroom by respondent Richter\u2019s codefendant,\n  Branscombe; that he found Klein on the living room couch; and that\n  his gun safe, a pistol, and cash were missing. His account was cor\n  roborated by evidence at the scene, including, relevant here, spent\n  shell casings, blood spatters, and blood pooled in the bedroom door\n  way. Investigators took a blood sample from a wall near the bedroom\n  door, but not from the blood pool. A search of Richter\u2019s home turned\n  up the safe and ammunition matching evidence at the scene. After\n  his arrest on murder and other charges, Richter initially denied his\n  involvement, but later admitted disposing of Johnson\u2019s and\n  Branscombe\u2019s guns. The prosecution initially built its case on John\n  son\u2019s testimony and the circumstantial evidence, but it adjusted its\n  approach after Richter\u2019s counsel, in his opening statement, outlined\n  the theory that Branscombe shot Johnson in self-defense and that\n  Klein was killed in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway, and\n  stressed the lack of forensic support for the prosecution\u2019s case. The\n  prosecution then decided to call an expert in blood pattern evidence,\n  who testified that it was unlikely that Klein had been shot outside\n  the living room and then moved to the couch, and a serologist, who\n  testified that the blood sample taken near the blood pool could be\n  Johnson\u2019s but not Klein\u2019s. Under cross-examination, she conceded\n  that she had not tested the sample for cross-contamination and that\n  a degraded sample would make it difficult to tell if it had blood of\n  Klein\u2019s type. Defense counsel called Richter to tell his conflicting\n  version of events and called other witnesses to corroborate Richter\u2019s\n  version. Richter was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n2                      HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    He later sought habeas relief from the California Supreme Court, as\n    serting, inter alia, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance,\n    see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, when he failed to pre\n    sent expert testimony on blood evidence, because it could have dis\n    closed the blood pool\u2019s source and bolstered Richter\u2019s theory. He also\n    offered affidavits from forensics experts to support his claim. The\n    court denied the petition in a one-sentence summary order. Subse\n    quently, he reasserted his state claims in a federal habeas petition.\n    The District Court denied his petition. A Ninth Circuit panel af\n    firmed, but the en banc court reversed. Initially it questioned\n    whether 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)\u2014which, as amended by the Antiterror\n    ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), limits the\n    availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously \u201cadjudicated\n    on the merits\u201d in state court\u2014applied to Richter\u2019s petition, since the\n    State Supreme Court issued only a summary denial. But it found the\n    state-court decision unreasonable anyway. In its view, trial counsel\n    was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in planning\n    a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prose\n    cution might\u2014and later did\u2014offer.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2254(d) applies to Richter\u2019s petition, even though the\n state court\u2019s order was unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the\n court\u2019s reasoning. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (a) By its terms, \u00a72254(d) bars relitigation of a claim \u201cadjudicated\n on the merits\u201d in state court unless, among other exceptions, the ear\n lier state-court \u201cdecision\u201d involved \u201can unreasonable application\u201d of\n \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by\u201d this Court,\n \u00a72254(d)(1). Nothing in its text\u2014which refers only to a \u201cdecision\u201d re\n sulting \u201cfrom an adjudication\u201d\u2014requires a statement of reasons.\n Where the state-court decision has no explanation, the habeas peti\n tioner must still show there was no reasonable basis for the state\n court to deny relief. There is no merit to the assertion that applying\n \u00a72254(d) when state courts issue summary rulings will encourage\n those courts to withhold explanations. The issuance of summary dis\n positions can enable state judiciaries to concentrate resources where\n most needed. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) Nor is there merit to Richter\u2019s argument that \u00a72254(d) does\n not apply because the California Supreme Court did not say it was\n adjudicating his claim \u201con the merits.\u201d When a state court has de\n nied relief, adjudication on the merits can be presumed absent any\n contrary indication or state-law procedural principles. The presump\n tion may be overcome by a more likely explanation for the state\n court\u2019s decision, but Richter does not make that showing here.

Richter was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the\nNinth Circuit. Pp. 10\u201324.\n      (a) That court failed to accord the required deference to the deci\nsion of a state court adjudicating the same claims later presented in\nthe federal habeas petition. Its opinion shows an improper under\nstanding of \u00a72254(d)\u2019s unreasonableness standard and operation in\nthe context of a Strickland claim. Asking whether the state court\u2019s\napplication of Strickland\u2019s standard was unreasonable is different\nfrom asking whether defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below that\nstandard. Under AEDPA, a state court must be granted a deference\nand latitude that are not in operation in a case involving direct re\nview under Strickland. A state court\u2019s determination that a claim\nlacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as \u201cfair-minded ju\nrists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of that decision. Yarborough\nv. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664. And the more general the rule being\nconsidered, \u201cthe more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in\ncase-by-case determinations.\u201d Ibid. The Ninth Circuit explicitly con\nducted a de novo review and found a Strickland violation; it then de\nclared without further explanation that the state court\u2019s contrary de\ncision was unreasonable. But \u00a72254(d) requires a habeas court to\ndetermine what arguments or theories supported, or could have sup\nported, the state-court decision; and then to ask whether it is possible\nfair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories\nare inconsistent with a prior decision of this Court. AEDPA\u2019s unrea\nsonableness standard is not a test of the confidence of a federal ha\nbeas court in the conclusion it would reach as a de novo matter. Even\na strong case for relief does not make the state court\u2019s contrary con\nclusion unreasonable. Section 2254(d) is designed to confirm that\nstate courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal\nlenges to state convictions. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that Richter demon\nstrated an unreasonable application of Strickland by the state court.\nPp. 14\u201323.\n        (1) Richter could have secured relief in state court only by\nshowing both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that\nprejudice resulted. To be deficient, counsel\u2019s representation must\nhave fallen \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 688; and there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that\ncounsel\u2019s representation is within the \u201cwide range\u201d of reasonable pro\nfessional assistance, id., at 689. The question is whether counsel\nmade errors so fundamental that counsel was not functioning as the\ncounsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Prejudice requires\ndemonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unpro\nfessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ\n4                      HARRINGTON v.

S.___, ___. Strickland can func\n    tion as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture. The question is\n    whether an attorney\u2019s representation amounted to incompetence un\n    der prevailing professional norms, not whether it deviated from best\n    practices or most common custom. Establishing that a state court\u2019s\n    application of Strickland was unreasonable under \u00a72254(d) is even\n    more difficult, since both standards are \u201chighly deferential,\u201d 466 U. S,\n    at 689, and since Strickland\u2019s general standard has a substantial\n    range of reasonable applications. The question under \u00a72254(d) is not\n    whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable, but whether there is any\n    reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential\n    standard. Pp. 14\u201316.\n           (2) The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that because Richter\u2019s\n    attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced ex\n    pert evidence, the State Supreme Court could not reasonably have\n    concluded counsel provided adequate representation.\n       A state court could reasonably conclude that a competent attorney\n    could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence ex\n    perts. Rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys\n    will be limited to any one technique or approach. There were any\n    number of experts whose insight might have been useful to the de\n    fense. Counsel is entitled to balance limited resources in accord with\n    effective trial tactics and strategies. In finding otherwise the Ninth\n    Circuit failed to \u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s chal\n    lenged conduct\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective\n    at the time.\u201d Strickland, supra, at 689. Given the many factual dif\n    ferences between the prosecution and defense versions of events, it\n    was far from evident at the time of trial that the blood source was\n    central to Richter\u2019s case. And relying on \u201cthe harsh light of hind\n    sight\u201d to cast doubt on a trial that took place over 15 years ago is pre\n    cisely what Strickland and AEDPA seek to prevent. See Bell v. Cone,\n    535 U. S. 685, 702. Even had the value of expert testimony been ap\n    parent, it would be reasonable to conclude that a competent attorney\n    might elect not to use it here, where counsel had reason to question\n    the truth of his client\u2019s account. Making blood evidence a central is\n    sue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert\n    analysis, possibly destroying Richter\u2019s case, or distracted the jury\n    with esoteric questions of forensic science. Defense counsel\u2019s opening\n    statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evi\n    dence, but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out\n    as well as hoped. In light of the record here there was no basis to\n    rule that the state court\u2019s determination was unreasonable.\n       The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inac\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                        5\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  curate account of counsel\u2019s actual thinking, since Strickland exam\n  ined only the objective reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions. As to\n  whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing ex\n  pert testimony as a response to the prosecution\u2019s, an attorney may\n  not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or\n  for failing to prepare for remote possibilities. Here, even if counsel\n  was mistaken, the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic\n  testimony until the eve of trial. Thus, it is at least debatable whether\n  counsel\u2019s error was so fundamental as to call the trial\u2019s fairness into\n  doubt. Even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecution\u2019s tactic,\n  Richter would still need to show it was indisputable that Strickland\n  required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on\n  cross-examination to discredit the witnesses, but Strickland imposes\n  no such requirement. And while it is possible an isolated error can\n  constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious, it is dif\n  ficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsel\u2019s overall per\n  formance reflects active and capable advocacy. Pp. 16\u201322.\n          (3) The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that Richter had\n  established prejudice under Strickland, which asks whether it is\n  \u201creasonably likely\u201d the verdict would have been different, 466 U. S.,\n  at 696, not whether a court can be certain counsel\u2019s performance had\n  no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been\n  established had counsel acted differently. There must be a substan\n  tial likelihood of a different result. The State Supreme Court could\n  have reasonably concluded that Richter\u2019s prejudice evidence fell short\n  of this standard. His expert serology evidence established only a\n  theoretical possibility of Klein\u2019s blood being in the blood pool; and at\n  trial, defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prose\n  cution\u2019s expert. It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab\n  lished prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other\n  conclusions of the prosecution\u2019s experts, e.g., that the blood sample\n  matched Johnson\u2019s blood type. There was, furthermore, sufficient\n  conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to Richter\u2019s guilt, in\n  cluding, e.g., the items found at his home.

Judges\nmust be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions\nfor the writ, a commitment that entails substantial judi\ncial resources. Those resources are diminished and mis\nspent, however, and confidence in the writ and the law it\nvindicates undermined, if there is judicial disregard for\nthe sound and established principles that inform its\nproper issuance. That judicial disregard is inherent in the\nopinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here\nunder review. The Court of Appeals, in disagreement with\nthe contrary conclusions of the Supreme Court of the State\nof California and of a United States District Court, or\ndered habeas corpus relief granted to set aside the convic\ntion of Joshua Richter, respondent here. This was clear\nerror.\n   Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), the availability of federal\nhabeas relief is limited with respect to claims previously\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state-court proceedings.\nThe first inquiry this case presents is whether that pro\n2                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvision applies when state-court relief is denied without\nan accompanying statement of reasons. If it does, the\nquestion is whether the Court of Appeals adhered to the\nstatute\u2019s terms, in this case as it relates to ineffective\nassistance claims judged by the standard set forth in\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). A second\ncase decided today, Premo v. Moore, post, p. ___, presents\nsimilar issues. Here, as in that case, it is necessary to\nreverse the Court of Appeals for failing to accord required\ndeference to the decision of a state court.\n\n                            I\n  It is necessary to begin by discussing the details of a\ncrime committed more than a decade and a half ago.\n\n                             A\n   Sometime after midnight on December 20, 1994, sher\niff\u2019s deputies in Sacramento County, California, arrived at\nthe home of a drug dealer named Joshua Johnson. Hours\nbefore, Johnson had been smoking marijuana in the com\npany of Richter and two other men, Christian Branscombe\nand Patrick Klein. When the deputies arrived, however,\nthey found only Johnson and Klein. Johnson was hysteri\ncal and covered in blood. Klein was lying on a couch in\nJohnson\u2019s living room, unconscious and bleeding. Klein\nand Johnson each had been shot twice. Johnson recov\nered; Klein died of his wounds.\n   Johnson gave investigators this account: After falling\nasleep, he awoke to find Richter and Branscombe in his\nbedroom, at which point Branscombe shot him. Johnson\nheard more gunfire in the living room and the sound of his\nassailants leaving. He got up, found Klein bleeding on the\nliving room couch, and called 911. A gun safe, a pistol,\nand $6,000 cash, all of which had been in the bedroom,\nwere missing.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Evidence at the scene corroborated Johnson\u2019s account.\nInvestigators found spent shell casings in the bedroom\n(where Johnson said he had been shot) and in the living\nroom (where Johnson indicated Klein had been shot). In\nthe living room there were two casings, a .32 caliber and a\n.22 caliber. One of the bullets recovered from Klein\u2019s body\nwas a .32 and the other was a .22. In the bedroom there\nwere two more casings, both .32 caliber. In addition detec\ntives found blood spatter near the living room couch and\nbloodstains in the bedroom. Pools of blood had collected in\nthe kitchen and the doorway to Johnson\u2019s bedroom. Inves\ntigators took only a few blood samples from the crime\nscene. One was from a blood splash on the wall near\nthe bedroom doorway, but no sample was taken from the\ndoorway blood pool itself.\n   Investigators searched Richter\u2019s residence and found\nJohnson\u2019s gun safe, two boxes of .22-caliber ammunition,\nand a gun magazine loaded with cartridges of the same\nbrand and type as the boxes. A ballistics expert later\nconcluded the .22-caliber bullet that struck Klein and\nthe .22-caliber shell found in the living room matched the\nammunition found in Richter\u2019s home and bore markings\nconsistent with the model of gun for which the magazine\nwas designed.\n   Richter and Branscombe were arrested. At first Richter\ndenied involvement. He would later admit taking John\nson\u2019s pistol and disposing of it and of the .32-caliber\nweapon Branscombe used to shoot Johnson and Klein.\nRichter\u2019s counsel produced Johnson\u2019s missing pistol, but\nneither of the guns used to shoot Johnson and Klein was\nfound.\n                             B\n  Branscombe and Richter were tried together on charges\nof murder, attempted murder, burglary, and robbery.\nOnly Richter\u2019s case is presented here.\n4                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The prosecution built its case on Johnson\u2019s testimony\nand on circumstantial evidence. Its opening statement\ntook note of the shell casings found at the crime scene and\nthe ammunition and gun safe found at Richter\u2019s residence.\nDefense counsel offered explanations for the circumstan\ntial evidence and derided Johnson as a drug dealer, a\nparanoid, and a trigger-happy gun fanatic who had drawn\na pistol on Branscombe and Richter the last time he had\nseen them. And there were inconsistencies in Johnson\u2019s\nstory. In his 911 call, for instance, Johnson first said\nthere were four or five men who had broken into his\nhouse, not two; and in the call he did not identify Richter\nand Branscombe among the intruders.\n   Blood evidence does not appear to have been part of the\nprosecution\u2019s planned case prior to trial, and investigators\nhad not analyzed the few blood samples taken from the\ncrime scene. But the opening statement from the defense\nled the prosecution to alter its approach. Richter\u2019s attor\nney outlined the theory that Branscombe had fired on\nJohnson in self-defense and that Klein had been killed not\non the living room couch but in the crossfire in the bed\nroom doorway. Defense counsel stressed deficiencies in\nthe investigation, including the absence of forensic support\nfor the prosecution\u2019s version of events.\n   The prosecution took steps to adjust to the counterat\ntack now disclosed. Without advance notice and over the\nobjection of Richter\u2019s attorney, one of the detectives who\ninvestigated the shootings testified for the prosecution as\nan expert in blood pattern evidence. He concluded it was\nunlikely Klein had been shot outside the living room and\nthen moved to the couch, given the patterns of blood on\nKlein\u2019s face, as well as other evidence including \u201chigh\nvelocity\u201d blood spatter near the couch consistent with the\nlocation of a shooting. The prosecution also offered testi\nmony from a serologist. She testified the blood sample\ntaken near the pool by the bedroom door could be John\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nson\u2019s but not Klein\u2019s.\n  Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination probed weaknesses\nin the testimony of these two witnesses. The detective\nwho testified on blood patterns acknowledged that his\ninferences were imprecise, that it was unlikely Klein had\nbeen lying down on the couch when shot, and that he could\nnot say the blood in the living room was from either of\nKlein\u2019s wounds. Defense counsel elicited from the serolo\ngist a concession that she had not tested the bedroom\nblood sample for cross-contamination. She said that if the\nyear-old sample had degraded, it would be difficult to tell\nwhether blood of Klein\u2019s type was also present in the\nsample.\n  For the defense, Richter\u2019s attorney called seven wit\nnesses. Prominent among these was Richter himself.\nRichter testified he and Branscombe returned to Johnson\u2019s\nhouse just before the shootings in order to deliver some\nthing to one of Johnson\u2019s roommates. By Richter\u2019s ac\ncount, Branscombe entered the house alone while Richter\nwaited in the driveway; but after hearing screams and\ngunshots, Richter followed inside. There he saw Klein\nlying not on the couch but in the bedroom doorway, with\nJohnson on the bed and Branscombe standing in the\nmiddle of the room. According to Richter, Branscombe\nsaid he shot at Johnson and Klein after they attacked him.\nOther defense witnesses provided some corroboration for\nRichter\u2019s story. His former girlfriend, for instance, said\nshe saw the gun safe at Richter\u2019s house shortly before the\nshootings.\n  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.\nRichter was sentenced to life without parole. On appeal,\nhis conviction was affirmed. People v. Branscombe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

His conviction\nbecame final.\n                              C\n   Richter later petitioned the California Supreme Court\nfor a writ of habeas corpus. He asserted a number of\ngrounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of coun\nsel. As relevant here, he claimed his counsel was deficient\nfor failing to present expert testimony on serology, pathol\nogy, and blood spatter patterns, testimony that, he argued,\nwould disclose the source of the blood pool in the bedroom\ndoorway. This, he contended, would bolster his theory\nthat Johnson had moved Klein to the couch.\n   He offered affidavits from three types of forensic ex\nperts. First, he provided statements from two blood se\nrologists who said there was a possibility Klein\u2019s blood was\nintermixed with blood of Johnson\u2019s type in the sample\ntaken from near the pool in the bedroom doorway. Second,\nhe provided a statement from a pathologist who said the\nblood pool was too large to have come from Johnson given\nthe nature of his wounds and his own account of his ac\ntions while waiting for the police. Third, he provided a\nstatement from an expert in bloodstain analysis who said\nthe absence of \u201ca large number of satellite droplets\u201d in\nphotographs of the area around the blood in the bedroom\ndoorway was inconsistent with the blood pool coming from\nJohnson as he stood in the doorway. App. 118. Richter\nargued this evidence established the possibility that the\nblood in the bedroom doorway came from Klein, not John\nson. If that were true, he argued, it would confirm his\naccount, not Johnson\u2019s. The California Supreme Court\ndenied Richter\u2019s petition in a one-sentence summary\norder. See In re Richter, No. S082167 (Mar. 28, 2001),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 22a.

He reasserted the claims in his\nstate petition. The District Court denied his petition, and\na three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. See Richter v. Hickman, 521 F. 3d 1222\n(2008). The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc\nand reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. See Richter v.\nHickman, 578 F. 3d 944 (2009).\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court of Appeals ques\ntioned whether 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) was applicable to\nRichter\u2019s petition, since the California Supreme Court\nissued only a summary denial when it rejected his Strick\nland claims; but it determined the California decision was\nunreasonable in any event and that Richter was entitled\nto relief. The court held Richter\u2019s trial counsel was defi\ncient for failing to consult experts on blood evidence in\ndetermining and pursuing a trial strategy and in prepar\ning to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might\u2014and\nlater did\u2014offer. Four judges dissented from the en banc\ndecision.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U.

C. \u00a72254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of\n\u00a72254(d) states:\n      \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim\u2014\n      \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n8                HARRINGTON v.

There is no text\nin the statute requiring a statement of reasons. The\nstatute refers only to a \u201cdecision,\u201d which resulted from an\n\u201cadjudication.\u201d As every Court of Appeals to consider the\nissue has recognized, determining whether a state court\u2019s\ndecision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual\nconclusion does not require that there be an opinion from\nthe state court explaining the state court\u2019s reasoning. See\nChadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606 (CA3 2002);\nWright v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 278 F. 3d\n1245, 1253\u20131254 (CA11 2002); Sellan v.

And as this Court has ob\nserved, a state court need not cite or even be aware of our\ncases under \u00a72254(d). Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8\n(2002) (per curiam). Where a state court\u2019s decision is\nunaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner\u2019s\nburden still must be met by showing there was no reason\nable basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so\nwhether or not the state court reveals which of the ele\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Opinion-writing practices in state courts are\ninfluenced by considerations other than avoiding scrutiny\nby collateral attack in federal court. Cf.

At\nthe same time, requiring a statement of reasons could\nundercut state practices designed to preserve the integrity\nof the case-law tradition. The issuance of summary dispo\nsitions in many collateral attack cases can enable a state\njudiciary to concentrate its resources on the cases where\nopinions are most needed. See Brief for California Attor\nneys for Criminal Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (noting\nthat the California Supreme Court disposes of close to\n10,000 cases a year, including more than 3,400 original\nhabeas corpus petitions).\n   There is no merit either in Richter\u2019s argument that\n\u00a72254(d) is inapplicable because the California Supreme\nCourt did not say it was adjudicating his claim \u201con the\nmerits.\u201d The state court did not say it was denying the\nclaim for any other reason. When a federal claim has been\npresented to a state court and the state court has denied\nrelief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or\nstate-law procedural principles to the contrary. Cf. Harris\nv. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 265 (1989) (presumption of a merits\ndetermination when it is unclear whether a decision ap\n10                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npearing to rest on federal grounds was decided on another\nbasis).\n   The presumption may be overcome when there is reason\nto think some other explanation for the state court\u2019s deci\nsion is more likely. See, e.g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501\nU. S. 797, 803 (1991). Richter, however, does not make\nthat showing. He mentions the theoretical possibility that\nthe members of the California Supreme Court may not\nhave agreed on the reasons for denying his petition. It is\npure speculation, however, to suppose that happened in\nthis case. And Richter\u2019s assertion that the mere possibil\nity of a lack of agreement prevents any attribution of\nreasons to the state court\u2019s decision is foreclosed by prece\ndent. See ibid.\n   As has been noted before, the California courts or Legis\nlature can alter the State\u2019s practices or elaborate more\nfully on their import. See Evans v. Chavis, 546 U. S. 189,\n197, 199 (2006). But that has not occurred here. This\nCourt now holds and reconfirms that \u00a72254(d) does not\nrequire a state court to give reasons before its decision can\nbe deemed to have been \u201cadjudicated on the merits.\u201d\nRichter has failed to show that the California Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision did not involve a determination of the\nmerits of his claim. Section 2254(d) applies to his petition.\n                             III\n  Federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims\nsubject to \u00a72254(d) unless it is shown that the earlier state\ncourt\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to\u201d federal law then clearly\nestablished in the holdings of this Court, \u00a72254(d)(1);\nWilliams v.

In the view of the Court of\nAppeals, the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Rich\nter\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim unreasonably applied the\nholding in Strickland. The Court of Appeals\u2019 lengthy\nopinion, however, discloses an improper understanding of\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s unreasonableness standard and of its operation\nin the context of a Strickland claim.\n  The pivotal question is whether the state court\u2019s appli\ncation of the Strickland standard was unreasonable. This\nis different from asking whether defense counsel\u2019s per\nformance fell below Strickland\u2019s standard. Were that the\ninquiry, the analysis would be no different than if, for\nexample, this Court were adjudicating a Strickland claim\non direct review of a criminal conviction in a United States\ndistrict court. Under AEDPA, though, it is a necessary\npremise that the two questions are different. For purposes\nof \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201can unreasonable application of federal law\nis different from an incorrect application of federal law.\u201d\nWilliams, supra, at 410. A state court must be granted a\ndeference and latitude that are not in operation when the\ncase involves review under the Strickland standard itself.\n  A state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit\nprecludes federal habeas relief so long as \u201cfairminded\njurists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of the state\ncourt\u2019s decision. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,\n664 (2004).        And as this Court has explained,\n\u201c[E]valuating whether a rule application was unreason\nable requires considering the rule\u2019s specificity. The more\ngeneral the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching\noutcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[I]t is\nnot an unreasonable application of clearly established\nFederal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific\nlegal rule that has not been squarely established by this\n12               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt.\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 9\u201310) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here it is not apparent how the Court of Appeals\u2019 analy\nsis would have been any different without AEDPA. The\ncourt explicitly conducted a de novo review, 578 F. 3d, at\n952; and after finding a Strickland violation, it declared,\nwithout further explanation, that the \u201cstate court\u2019s deci\nsion to the contrary constituted an unreasonable applica\ntion of Strickland.\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 969. AEDPA demands\nmore. Under \u00a72254(d), a habeas court must determine\nwhat arguments or theories supported or, as here, could\nhave supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then it\nmust ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could\ndisagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent\nwith the holding in a prior decision of this Court. The\nopinion of the Court of Appeals all but ignored \u201cthe only\nquestion that matters under \u00a72254(d)(1).\u201d Lockyer v.\nAndrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71 (2003).\n   The Court of Appeals appears to have treated the un\nreasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the\nresult it would reach under de novo review: Because the\nCourt of Appeals had little doubt that Richter\u2019s Strickland\nclaim had merit, the Court of Appeals concluded the state\ncourt must have been unreasonable in rejecting it. This\nanalysis overlooks arguments that would otherwise justify\nthe state court\u2019s result and ignores further limitations of\n\u00a72254(d), including its requirement that the state court\u2019s\ndecision be evaluated according to the precedents of this\nCourt. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 11\u201312). It bears repeating that even a strong case\nfor relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclu\nsion was unreasonable. See Lockyer, supra, at 75.\n   If this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it\nwas meant to be. As amended by AEDPA, \u00a72254(d) stops\nshort of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitiga\ntion of claims already rejected in state proceedings. Cf.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

S. 651, 664 (1996) (discussing\nAEDPA\u2019s \u201cmodified res judicata rule\u201d under \u00a72244). It\npreserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there\nis no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the\nstate court\u2019s decision conflicts with this Court\u2019s prece\ndents. It goes no farther. Section 2254(d) reflects the view\nthat habeas corpus is a \u201cguard against extreme malfunc\ntions in the state criminal justice systems,\u201d not a substi\ntute for ordinary error correction through appeal. Jackson\nv. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332, n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). As a condition for obtaining\nhabeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner must\nshow that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being pre\nsented in federal court was so lacking in justification that\nthere was an error well understood and comprehended in\nexisting law beyond any possibility for fairminded dis\nagreement.\n   The reasons for this approach are familiar. \u201cFederal\nhabeas review of state convictions frustrates both the\nStates\u2019 sovereign power to punish offenders and their\ngood-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.\u201d\nCalderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555\u2013556 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It \u201cdisturbs the\nState\u2019s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga\ntion, denies society the right to punish some admitted\noffenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree\nmatched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\u201d\nReed, 489 U. S., at 282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal\nhabeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts\nare the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal\nlenges to state convictions. Under the exhaustion re\nquirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state convic\ntion must first attempt to present his claim in state court.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b). If the state court rejects the claim on\nprocedural grounds, the claim is barred in federal court\n14               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunless one of the exceptions to the doctrine of Wainwright\nv. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82\u201384 (1977), applies. And if the\nstate court denies the claim on the merits, the claim is\nbarred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to\n\u00a72254(d) set out in \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and (2) applies. Section\n2254(d) thus complements the exhaustion requirement\nand the doctrine of procedural bar to ensure that state\nproceedings are the central process, not just a preliminary\nstep for a later federal habeas proceeding, see id., at 90.\n   Here, however, the Court of Appeals gave \u00a72254(d) no\noperation or function in its reasoning. Its analysis illus\ntrates a lack of deference to the state court\u2019s determina\ntion and an improper intervention in state criminal proc\nesses, contrary to the purpose and mandate of AEDPA and\nto the now well-settled meaning and function of habeas\ncorpus in the federal system.\n                             IV\n  The conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Richter\ndemonstrated an unreasonable application by the state\ncourt of the Strickland standard now must be discussed.\nTo have been entitled to relief from the California Su\npreme Court, Richter had to show both that his counsel\nprovided deficient assistance and that there was prejudice\nas a result.\n  To establish deficient performance, a person challenging\na conviction must show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U. S.,\nat 688. A court considering a claim of ineffective assis\ntance must apply a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation was within the \u201cwide range\u201d of reasonable\nprofessional assistance. Id., at 689.

It is not enough \u201cto show that the errors had\nsome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d\nId., at 693. Counsel\u2019s errors must be \u201cso serious as to\ndeprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is\nreliable.\u201d Id., at 687.\n   \u201cSurmounting Strickland\u2019s high bar is never an easy\ntask.\u201d Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as\na way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise\nissues not presented at trial, and so the Strickland stan\ndard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest \u201cintrusive\npost-trial inquiry\u201d threaten the integrity of the very ad\nversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 689\u2013690. Even under de novo\nreview, the standard for judging counsel\u2019s representation\nis a most deferential one. Unlike a later reviewing court,\nthe attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of\nmaterials outside the record, and interacted with the\nclient, with opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is \u201call\ntoo tempting\u201d to \u201csecond-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after\nconviction or adverse sentence.\u201d Id., at 689; see also Bell\nv. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell,\n506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an\nattorney\u2019s representation amounted to incompetence\nunder \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d not whether it\ndeviated from best practices or most common custom.\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\n   Establishing that a state court\u2019s application of Strick\nland was unreasonable under \u00a72254(d) is all the more\ndifficult.   The standards created by Strickland and\n\u00a72254(d) are both \u201chighly deferential,\u201d id., at 689; Lindh v.\nMurphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and when the two\n16                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napply in tandem, review is \u201cdoubly\u201d so, Knowles, 556 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strickland standard is a gen\neral one, so the range of reasonable applications is sub\nstantial. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Federal habeas\ncourts must guard against the danger of equating unrea\nsonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness\nunder \u00a72254(d). When \u00a72254(d) applies, the question is\nnot whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The ques\ntion is whether there is any reasonable argument that\ncounsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\n                              A\n  With respect to defense counsel\u2019s performance, the\nCourt of Appeals held that because Richter\u2019s attorney had\nnot consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert\nevidence, the California Supreme Court could not rea\nsonably have concluded counsel provided adequate repre\nsentation. This conclusion was erroneous.\n                              1\n   The Court of Appeals first held that Richter\u2019s attorney\nrendered constitutionally deficient service because he did\nnot consult blood evidence experts in developing the basic\nstrategy for Richter\u2019s defense or offer their testimony as\npart of the principal case for the defense. Strickland,\nhowever, permits counsel to \u201cmake a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 691. It was at least arguable that a reasonable\nattorney could decide to forgo inquiry into the blood evi\ndence in the circumstances here.\n   Criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and\navailable defense strategy requires consultation with\nexperts or introduction of expert evidence, whether pre\ntrial, at trial, or both. There are, however, \u201ccountless\nways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\nEven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

Rare are\nthe situations in which the \u201cwide latitude counsel must\nhave in making tactical decisions\u201d will be limited to any\none technique or approach. Ibid. It can be assumed that\nin some cases counsel would be deemed ineffective for\nfailing to consult or rely on experts, but even that formula\ntion is sufficiently general that state courts would have\nwide latitude in applying it. Here it would be well within\nthe bounds of a reasonable judicial determination for the\nstate court to conclude that defense counsel could follow a\nstrategy that did not require the use of experts regarding\nthe pool in the doorway to Johnson\u2019s bedroom.\n   From the perspective of Richter\u2019s defense counsel when\nhe was preparing Richter\u2019s defense, there were any num\nber of hypothetical experts\u2014specialists in psychiatry,\npsychology, ballistics, fingerprints, tire treads, physiology,\nor numerous other disciplines and subdisciplines\u2014whose\ninsight might possibly have been useful. An attorney can\navoid activities that appear \u201cdistractive from more impor\ntant duties.\u201d Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 8). Counsel was entitled to for\nmulate a strategy that was reasonable at the time and to\nbalance limited resources in accord with effective trial\ntactics and strategies. See Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14\u201315); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 383 (2005);\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 525 (2003); Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 699.\n   In concluding otherwise the Court of Appeals failed to\n\u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged\nconduct\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s per\nspective at the time.\u201d Id., at 689. In its view Klein\u2019s\nlocation was \u201cthe single most critical issue in the case\u201d\ngiven the differing theories of the prosecution and the\ndefense, and the source of the blood in the doorway was\ntherefore of central concern. 578 F. 3d, at 953\u2013954. But it\nwas far from a necessary conclusion that this was evident\n18               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the trial. There were many factual differ\nences between prosecution and defense versions of the\nevents on the night of the shootings. It is only because\nforensic evidence has emerged concerning the source of the\nblood pool that the issue could with any plausibility be\nsaid to stand apart. Reliance on \u201cthe harsh light of hind\nsight\u201d to cast doubt on a trial that took place now more\nthan 15 years ago is precisely what Strickland and\nAEDPA seek to prevent. Cone, 535 U. S., at 702; see also\nLockhart, 506 U. S., at 372.\n  Even if it had been apparent that expert blood testi\nmony could support Richter\u2019s defense, it would be reason\nable to conclude that a competent attorney might elect not\nto use it. The Court of Appeals opinion for the en banc\nmajority rests in large part on a hypothesis that reasona\nbly could have been rejected. The hypothesis is that with\nout jeopardizing Richter\u2019s defense, an expert could have\ntestified that the blood in Johnson\u2019s doorway could not\nhave come from Johnson and could have come from Klein,\nthus suggesting that Richter\u2019s version of the shooting was\ncorrect and Johnson\u2019s a fabrication. This theory overlooks\nthe fact that concentrating on the blood pool carried its\nown serious risks. If serological analysis or other forensic\nevidence demonstrated that the blood came from Johnson\nalone, Richter\u2019s story would be exposed as an invention.\nAn attorney need not pursue an investigation that would\nbe fruitless, much less one that might be harmful to the\ndefense. Strickland, supra, at 691. Here Richter\u2019s attor\nney had reason to question the truth of his client\u2019s ac\ncount, given, for instance, Richter\u2019s initial denial of\ninvolvement and the subsequent production of Johnson\u2019s\nmissing pistol.\n  It would have been altogether reasonable to conclude\nthat this concern justified the course Richter\u2019s counsel\npursued. Indeed, the Court of Appeals recognized this risk\ninsofar as it pertained to the suggestion that counsel\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould have had the blood evidence tested. 578 F. 3d, at\n956, n. 9. But the court failed to recognize that making a\ncentral issue out of blood evidence would have increased\nthe likelihood of the prosecution\u2019s producing its own evi\ndence on the blood pool\u2019s origins and composition; and\nonce matters proceeded on this course, there was a serious\nrisk that expert evidence could destroy Richter\u2019s case.\nEven apart from this danger, there was the possibility\nthat expert testimony could shift attention to esoteric\nmatters of forensic science, distract the jury from whether\nJohnson was telling the truth, or transform the case into a\nbattle of the experts. Accord, Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F. 3d\n815, 836 (CA9 1995).\n   True, it appears that defense counsel\u2019s opening state\nment itself inspired the prosecution to introduce expert\nforensic evidence. But the prosecution\u2019s evidence may\nwell have been weakened by the fact that it was assem\nbled late in the process; and in any event the prosecution\u2019s\nresponse shows merely that the defense strategy did not\nwork out as well as counsel had hoped, not that counsel\nwas incompetent.\n   To support a defense argument that the prosecution has\nnot proved its case it sometimes is better to try to cast\npervasive suspicion of doubt than to strive to prove a\ncertainty that exonerates. All that happened here is that\ncounsel pursued a course that conformed to the first op\ntion. If this case presented a de novo review of Strickland,\nthe foregoing might well suffice to reject the claim of\ninadequate counsel, but that is an unnecessary step. The\nCourt of Appeals must be reversed if there was a reason\nable justification for the state court\u2019s decision. In light of\nthe record here there was no basis to rule that the state\ncourt\u2019s determination was unreasonable.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing strategic\nconsiderations like these as an inaccurate account of\ncounsel\u2019s actual thinking. Although courts may not in\n20                HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndulge \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d for counsel\u2019s decisionmak\ning that contradicts the available evidence of counsel\u2019s\nactions, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 526\u2013527, neither may they\ninsist counsel confirm every aspect of the strategic basis\nfor his or her actions. There is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d\nthat counsel\u2019s attention to certain issues to the exclusion\nof others reflects trial tactics rather than \u201csheer neglect.\u201d\nYarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 8 (2003) (per curiam).\nAfter an adverse verdict at trial even the most experienced\ncounsel may find it difficult to resist asking whether a\ndifferent strategy might have been better, and, in the\ncourse of that reflection, to magnify their own responsibil\nity for an unfavorable outcome. Strickland, however, calls\nfor an inquiry into the objective reasonableness of coun\nsel\u2019s performance, not counsel\u2019s subjective state of mind.\n466 U. S., at 688.\n                              2\n   The Court of Appeals also found that Richter\u2019s attorney\nwas constitutionally deficient because he had not expected\nthe prosecution to offer expert testimony and therefore\nwas unable to offer expert testimony of his own in re\nsponse.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in suggesting counsel had\nto be prepared for \u201cany contingency,\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 946\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        Strickland does\nnot guarantee perfect representation, only a \u201c \u2018reasonably\ncompetent attorney.\u2019 \u201d 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann\nv. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 770 (1970)); see also Gentry,\nsupra, at 7. Representation is constitutionally ineffective\nonly if it \u201cso undermined the proper functioning of the\nadversarial process\u201d that the defendant was denied a fair\ntrial. Strickland, supra, at 686. Just as there is no expec\ntation that competent counsel will be a flawless strategist\nor tactician, an attorney may not be faulted for a reason\nable miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprepare for what appear to be remote possibilities.\n   Here, Richter\u2019s attorney was mistaken in thinking the\nprosecution would not present forensic testimony. But the\nprosecution itself did not expect to make that presenta-\ntion and had made no preparations for doing so on the eve\nof trial. For this reason alone, it is at least debatable\nwhether counsel\u2019s error was so fundamental as to call the\nfairness of the trial into doubt.\n   Even if counsel should have foreseen that the prosecu\ntion would offer expert evidence, Richter would still need\nto show it was indisputable that Strickland required his\nattorney to act upon that knowledge. Attempting to estab\nlish this, the Court of Appeals held that defense counsel\nshould have offered expert testimony to rebut the evidence\nfrom the prosecution. But Strickland does not enact New\nton\u2019s third law for the presentation of evidence, requiring\nfor every prosecution expert an equal and opposite expert\nfrom the defense.\n   In many instances cross-examination will be sufficient\nto expose defects in an expert\u2019s presentation. When de\nfense counsel does not have a solid case, the best strategy\ncan be to say that there is too much doubt about the\nState\u2019s theory for a jury to convict. And while in some\ninstances \u201ceven an isolated error\u201d can support an ineffec\ntive-assistance claim if it is \u201csufficiently egregious and\nprejudicial,\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986),\nit is difficult to establish ineffective assistance when coun\nsel\u2019s overall performance indicates active and capable\nadvocacy. Here Richter\u2019s attorney represented him with\nvigor and conducted a skillful cross-examination. As\nnoted, defense counsel elicited concessions from the State\u2019s\nexperts and was able to draw attention to weaknesses in\ntheir conclusions stemming from the fact that their analy\nses were conducted long after investigators had left the\ncrime scene. For all of these reasons, it would have been\nreasonable to find that Richter had not shown his attorney\n22               HARRINGTON v. RICHTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas deficient under Strickland.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals further concluded that Richter had\nestablished prejudice under Strickland given the expert\nevidence his attorney could have introduced. It held that\nthe California Supreme Court would have been unreason\nable in concluding otherwise. This too was error.\n   In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is\nnot whether a court can be certain counsel\u2019s performance\nhad no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible a\nreasonable doubt might have been established if counsel\nacted differently. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 13); Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 693. Instead, Strickland asks whether it is \u201crea\nsonably likely\u201d the result would have been different. Id.,\nat 696. This does not require a showing that counsel\u2019s\nactions \u201cmore likely than not altered the outcome,\u201d but the\ndifference between Strickland\u2019s prejudice standard and a\nmore-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters\n\u201conly in the rarest case.\u201d Id., at 693, 697. The likelihood\nof a different result must be substantial, not just conceiv\nable. Id., at 693.\n   It would not have been unreasonable for the California\nSupreme Court to conclude Richter\u2019s evidence of prejudice\nfell short of this standard. His expert serology evidence\nestablished nothing more than a theoretical possibility\nthat, in addition to blood of Johnson\u2019s type, Klein\u2019s blood\nmay also have been present in a blood sample taken near\nthe bedroom doorway pool. At trial, defense counsel ex\ntracted a concession along these lines from the prosecu\ntion\u2019s expert. The pathology expert\u2019s claim about the size\nof the blood pool could be taken to suggest only that the\nwounded and hysterical Johnson erred in his assessment\nof time or that he bled more profusely than estimated.\nAnd the analysis of the purported blood pattern expert\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindicated no more than that Johnson was not standing up\nwhen the blood pool formed.\n   It was also reasonable to find Richter had not estab\nlished prejudice given that he offered no evidence directly\nchallenging other conclusions reached by the prosecution\u2019s\nexperts. For example, there was no dispute that the blood\nsample taken near the doorway pool matched Johnson\u2019s\nblood type. The California Supreme Court reasonably\ncould have concluded that testimony about patterns that\nform when blood drips to the floor or about the rate at\nwhich Johnson was bleeding did not undermine the re\nsults of chemical tests indicating blood type. Nor did\nRichter provide any direct refutation of the State\u2019s expert\ntestimony describing how blood spatter near the couch\nsuggested a shooting in the living room and how the blood\npatterns on Klein\u2019s face were inconsistent with Richter\u2019s\ntheory that Klein had been killed in the bedroom doorway\nand moved to the couch.\n   There was, furthermore, sufficient conventional circum\nstantial evidence pointing to Richter\u2019s guilt. It included\nthe gun safe and ammunition found at his home; his flight\nfrom the crime scene; his disposal of the .32-caliber gun\nand of Johnson\u2019s pistol; his shifting story concerning his\ninvolvement; the disappearance prior to the arrival of the\nlaw enforcement officers of the .22-caliber weapon that\nkilled Klein; the improbability of Branscombe\u2019s not being\nwounded in the shootout that resulted in a combined four\nbullet wounds to Johnson and Klein; and the difficulties\nthe intoxicated and twice-shot Johnson would have had in\ncarrying the body of a dying man from bedroom doorway\nto living room couch, not to mention the lack of any obvi\nous reason for him to do so. There was ample basis for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to think any real possibility of\nRichter\u2019s being acquitted was eclipsed by the remaining\nevidence pointing to guilt.\n24               HARRINGTON v.

Richter was not entitled to the relief ordered\nby the Court of Appeals. The judgment is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.
