In November 2002,\nthe board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for\nparole, basing its decision on the “especially cruel and\ncallous manner” of his commitment offense, App. to Pet.\n2                  SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfor Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilita\ntive programs; his failure to develop marketable skills;\nand three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The\nboard admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psy\nchological report, but it dismissed the report as not credi\nble because it included several inconsistent and erroneous\nstatements.\n   Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nState Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The\nrecord indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence,\nincluding but certainly not limited to the life offense, to\nsupport the board’s denial.” Id., at 42a. Cooke subse\nquently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of\nAppeal and a petition for direct review by the California\nSupreme Court. Both were denied.\n   In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition\npursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254 challenging the parole\nboard’s determination. The District Court denied his\npetition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Cali\nfornia’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected\nby the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some\nevidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that feder\nally protected liberty interest. Cooke v. Solis, 606 F. 3d\n1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court\nhad made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence” under §2254(d)(2) by finding any\nevidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public\nsafety if released. Id., at 1215.\n                            B\n  Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree\nmurder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to\nimprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of\nparole. In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole,\nbut the Governor exercised his authority to review the\ncase and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal.\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nConst., Art. 5, §8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §3041.2 (West\n2000). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime;\nhis extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmi\nnation of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;\nhis failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his\nunrealistic plans for employment and housing after being\nparoled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor con\ncluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given\nhis propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable\nmeans of employment.\n  Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State\nSuperior Court. That court denied Clay’s petition, as did\nthe California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme\nCourt denied review.\n  Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The\nDistrict Court concluded that the Governor’s reliance on\nthe nature of Clay’s long-past commitment offense vio\nlated Clay’s right to due process, and dismissed each of\nthe other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the\nrecord. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that “the Governor’s decision\nwas an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some\nevidence’ rule and was an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented.” Clay v. Kane,\n384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).\n                              II\n  In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that\nthe state courts had misapplied California’s “some evi\ndence” rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either\nthat federal habeas relief is available for an error of state\nlaw, or that correct application of the State’s “some evi\ndence” standard is required by the federal Due Process\nClause. Neither assumption is correct.\n  As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously\n4                  SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprovides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas\ncorpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in\ncustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.’ ” Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal\nhabeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis\nv. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).\n   As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under\nthat provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether\nthere exists a liberty or property interest of which a per\nson has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the\nprocedures followed by the State were constitutionally\nsufficient. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490\nU. S. 454, 460 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that\nCalifornia law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606\nF. 3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that\nholding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.\nSee Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 373–381\n(1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correc\ntional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979).\n   Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state\ninterest created by California law. There is no right under\nthe Federal Constitution to be conditionally released\nbefore the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States\nare under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. Id., at\n7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the\nDue Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindi\ncation—and federal courts will review the application of\nthose constitutionally required procedures. In the context\nof parole, we have held that the procedures required are\nminimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject\nto a parole statute similar to California’s received ade\nquate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be\nheard and was provided a statement of the reasons why\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nparole was denied. 442 U. S., at 16. “The Constitution,”\nwe held, “does not require more.” Ibid. Cooke and Clay\nreceived at least this amount of process: They were al\nlowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the\nevidence against them, were afforded access to their re\ncords in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why\nparole was denied. 606 F. 3d, at 1208–1212; App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§3041, 3041.5\n(West Supp. 2010).\n  That should have been the beginning and the end of the\nfederal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and\nClay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of\nAppeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits\nand concluded that they had unreasonably determined the\nfacts in light of the evidence. See 606 F. 3d, at 1213–1216;\n384 Fed. Appx., at 545–546. Other Ninth Circuit cases\nhave done the same. See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F. 3d\n606, 611 (2010). No opinion of ours supports converting\nCalifornia’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive fed\neral requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the\ninterest in receiving parole when the California standards\nfor parole have been met, and the minimum procedures\nadequate for due-process protection of that interest are\nthose set forth in Greenholtz.* See Hayward v. Marshall,\n——————\n   * Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the\nrevocation of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621225/in-re-rosenkrantz/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657–658, 59 P. 3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Su\npreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in\nSuperintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472\nU. S. 445 (1985). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Califor\nnia’s parole system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first\ncitation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier\nopinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions to revoke parole\nthat had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P. 3d, at 204.\nThe second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discuss\ning the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply\nborrows language from Hill to support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring\n6                       SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n603 F. 3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). Greenholtz did\nnot inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite\nprocedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that\nthe evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern\nhere whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial\nreview (a procedure beyond what the Constitution de\nmands) was correctly applied.\n   It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence”\nrule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, 606 F. 3d,\nat 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court\nmerits review the application of all state-prescribed proce\ndures in cases involving liberty or property interests,\nincluding (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That\nhas never been the law. To the contrary, we have long\nrecognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial\nof due process.” Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21\n(1982); see also Estelle, 502 U. S., at 67–68. Because the\nonly federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant\ninquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not\nwhether the state court decided the case correctly.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there was\nno evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is\nirrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as\n§2254(a) requires. See id., at 67. The short of the matter\nis that the responsibility for assuring that the constitu\ntionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole\nsystem are properly applied rests with California courts,\nand is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’\n——————\na modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ”\n29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U. S., at 455). In\nany event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one\nof federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes\nclose to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved\nby a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised\nonly on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P. 3d, at 205, n. 12.\n              Cite as: 562 U.

The\nboard admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psy\nchological report, but it dismissed the report as not credi\nble because it included several inconsistent and erroneous\nstatements.\n   Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nState Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The\nrecord indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence,\nincluding but certainly not limited to the life offense, to\nsupport the board’s denial.” Id., at 42a. Cooke subse\nquently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of\nAppeal and a petition for direct review by the California\nSupreme Court. Both were denied.\n   In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition\npursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254 challenging the parole\nboard’s determination. The District Court denied his\npetition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Cali\nfornia’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected\nby the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some\nevidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that feder\nally protected liberty interest. Cooke v. Solis, 606 F. 3d\n1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court\nhad made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence” under §2254(d)(2) by finding any\nevidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public\nsafety if released.

The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime;\nhis extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmi\nnation of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;\nhis failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his\nunrealistic plans for employment and housing after being\nparoled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor con\ncluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given\nhis propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable\nmeans of employment.\n  Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State\nSuperior Court. That court denied Clay’s petition, as did\nthe California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme\nCourt denied review.\n  Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The\nDistrict Court concluded that the Governor’s reliance on\nthe nature of Clay’s long-past commitment offense vio\nlated Clay’s right to due process, and dismissed each of\nthe other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the\nrecord. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that “the Governor’s decision\nwas an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some\nevidence’ rule and was an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented.” Clay v. Kane,\n384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).\n                              II\n  In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that\nthe state courts had misapplied California’s “some evi\ndence” rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either\nthat federal habeas relief is available for an error of state\nlaw, or that correct application of the State’s “some evi\ndence” standard is required by the federal Due Process\nClause. Neither assumption is correct.\n  As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously\n4                  SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprovides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas\ncorpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in\ncustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.’ ” Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal\nhabeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis\nv. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780 (1990)).\n   As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under\nthat provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether\nthere exists a liberty or property interest of which a per\nson has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the\nprocedures followed by the State were constitutionally\nsufficient. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490\nU. S. 454, 460 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that\nCalifornia law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606\nF. 3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that\nholding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.\nSee Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369, 373–381\n(1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correc\ntional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 12 (1979).\n   Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state\ninterest created by California law. There is no right under\nthe Federal Constitution to be conditionally released\nbefore the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States\nare under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. Id., at\n7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the\nDue Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindi\ncation—and federal courts will review the application of\nthose constitutionally required procedures. In the context\nof parole, we have held that the procedures required are\nminimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject\nto a parole statute similar to California’s received ade\nquate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be\nheard and was provided a statement of the reasons why\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nparole was denied. 442 U. S., at 16. “The Constitution,”\nwe held, “does not require more.” Ibid. Cooke and Clay\nreceived at least this amount of process: They were al\nlowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the\nevidence against them, were afforded access to their re\ncords in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why\nparole was denied. 606 F. 3d, at 1208–1212; App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§3041, 3041.5\n(West Supp. 2010).\n  That should have been the beginning and the end of the\nfederal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and\nClay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of\nAppeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits\nand concluded that they had unreasonably determined the\nfacts in light of the evidence. See 606 F. 3d, at 1213–1216;\n384 Fed. Appx., at 545–546. Other Ninth Circuit cases\nhave done the same. See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F. 3d\n606, 611 (2010). No opinion of ours supports converting\nCalifornia’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive fed\neral requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the\ninterest in receiving parole when the California standards\nfor parole have been met, and the minimum procedures\nadequate for due-process protection of that interest are\nthose set forth in Greenholtz.* See Hayward v. Marshall,\n——————\n   * Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the\nrevocation of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz,\n29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59 P. 3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Su\npreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in\nSuperintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472\nU. S. 445 (1985). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Califor\nnia’s parole system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first\ncitation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier\nopinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions to revoke parole\nthat had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P. 3d, at 204.\nThe second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discuss\ning the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply\nborrows language from Hill to support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring\n6                       SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n603 F. 3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). Greenholtz did\nnot inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite\nprocedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that\nthe evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern\nhere whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial\nreview (a procedure beyond what the Constitution de\nmands) was correctly applied.\n   It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence”\nrule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, 606 F. 3d,\nat 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court\nmerits review the application of all state-prescribed proce\ndures in cases involving liberty or property interests,\nincluding (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That\nhas never been the law. To the contrary, we have long\nrecognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial\nof due process.” Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21\n(1982); see also Estelle, 502 U. S., at 67–68. Because the\nonly federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant\ninquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not\nwhether the state court decided the case correctly.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there was\nno evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is\nirrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as\n§2254(a) requires. See id., at 67. The short of the matter\nis that the responsibility for assuring that the constitu\ntionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole\nsystem are properly applied rests with California courts,\nand is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’\n——————\na modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ”\n29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U. S., at 455). In\nany event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one\nof federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes\nclose to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved\nby a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised\nonly on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P. 3d, at 205, n. 12.\n              Cite as: 562 U.

See In re Rosenkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59\nP. 3d 174, 205 (2002). The Ninth Circuit, however, has\ndetermined that for California’s parole system, as for\nNebraska’s, Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and\nCorrectional Complex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), is the controlling\nprecedent. Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F. 3d 546, 559–561\n(2010) (en banc)).
