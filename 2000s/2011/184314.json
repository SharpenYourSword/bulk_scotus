Argued December 8, 2010\u2014Decided January 24, 2011\r\nRegulation Z\u2014promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board (Board) pur\r\n  suant to its authority under the Truth in Lending Act\u2014requires\r\n  credit card issuers to disclose certain information to cardholders. The\r\n  version of the regulation in effect at the time this dispute arose\r\n  obliges issuers to provide to cardholders an \u201c[i]nitial disclosure\r\n  statement,\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7226.6, specifying \u201ceach periodic rate that may\r\n  be used to compute the finance charge,\u201d \u00a7226.6(a)(2). It also imposes\r\n  \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d \u00a7226.9, including notice to\r\n  cardholders \u201c[w]henever any term required to be disclosed under\r\n  \u00a7226.6 is changed,\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(1). When \u201ca periodic rate or other fi\r\n  nance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\n  default,\u201d notice must be given \u201cbefore the effective date of the\r\n  change.\u201d Ibid.\r\n     At the time respondent McCoy filed suit, he was the holder of a\r\n  credit card issued by petitioner Chase Bank. The cardholder agree\r\n  ment provided, in relevant part, that McCoy was eligible for \u201cPre\r\n  ferred rates\u201d as long as he met certain conditions. If any of those\r\n  conditions were not met, Chase reserved the right to raise the rate,\r\n  up to a pre-set maximum, and to apply the change to both existing\r\n  and new balances. McCoy alleges that Chase increased his interest\r\n  rate due to his delinquency or default and applied that increase ret\r\n  roactively, and that this action violated Regulation Z because Chase\r\n  did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect. The\r\n  District Court dismissed his complaint, holding that because the in\r\n  crease did not constitute a \u201cchange in terms\u201d under \u00a7226.9(c), Chase\r\n  was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that Regulation\r\n2                  CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    Z requires issuers to provide notice of an interest-rate increase prior\r\n    to its effective date.\r\nHeld: At the time of the transactions at issue, Regulation Z did not re\r\n quire Chase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice before\r\n implementing the agreement term allowing it to raise his interest\r\n rate, up to a pre-set maximum, following delinquency or default.\r\n Pp. 7\u201319.\r\n    (a) This case requires the Court to determine the meaning of a\r\n regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory authority.\r\n However, Regulation Z\u2019s text is unclear with respect to the crucial in\r\n terpretive question at issue: whether a change to an interest rate,\r\n pursuant to previously-disclosed contractual provision, constitutes a\r\n change to a \u201cterm required to be disclosed under \u00a7226.6\u201d requiring a\r\n subsequent disclosure under \u00a7226.9(c)(1). Because of this ambiguity,\r\n the Court must look to the Board\u2019s own interpretation of the regula\r\n tion for guidance in deciding this case. Pp. 7\u201312.\r\n    (b) The Board has made clear in its amicus brief to this Court that,\r\n in its view, Chase was not required to give McCoy notice of the inter\r\n est rate increase under the applicable version of Regulation Z. This\r\n Court defers to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, ad\r\n vanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is \u201cplainly errone\r\n ous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.\r\n 452, 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Auer, the Court de\r\n ferred to the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of his own regula\r\n tion, presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at the\r\n Court\u2019s invitation. The Court held that the fact that the interpreta\r\n tion came in a legal brief did not, \u201cin the circumstances of th[at] case,\r\n make it unworthy of deference.\u201d Id., at 462. The interpretation was\r\n \u201cin no sense a post hoc rationalization advanced by an agency seeking\r\n to defend past agency action against attack,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation\r\n marks and alteration omitted), and there was \u201cno reason to suspect\r\n that the interpretation [did] not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and consid\r\n ered judgment on the matter in question,\u201d ibid. The brief submitted\r\n by the Board here, at the Court\u2019s invitation, is no different. As in\r\n Auer, there is no reason to believe that the Board\u2019s interpretation is a\r\n \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d taken as a litigation position, for the Board\r\n is not a party to this case. And its interpretation is neither \u201cplainly\r\n erroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the indeterminate text of Regula\r\n tion Z. Thus, there is no reason to suspect that the Board\u2019s position\r\n in its amicus brief reflects anything other than its fair and considered\r\n judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute\r\n arose. That Congress and the Board may currently hold a different\r\n view does not mean that deference is not warranted to the Board\u2019s\r\n understanding of what the applicable version of Regulation Z re\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  quired. Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the inter\r\n  pretation in the agency amicus brief is warranted. Pp. 12\u201316.\r\n     (c) McCoy errs in arguing that deference to a legal brief is inappro\r\n  priate because the interpretation of Regulation Z in the Official Staff\r\n  Commentary commands a different result. While Commentary\r\n  promulgated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z may\r\n  warrant deference as a general matter, the Commentary explaining\r\n  the requirements at issue in this case largely replicates the ambigu\r\n  ity present in the regulatory text, and therefore offers no reason to\r\n  disregard the interpretation advanced in the Board\u2019s amicus brief.\r\n  Pp. 16\u201319.\r\n559 F. 3d 963, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\r\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. \u00a71601 et\r\nseq.\u2014requires that issuers of credit cards provide card\u00ad\r\nholders with an \u201c[i]nitial disclosure statement\u201d specifying,\r\ninter alia, \u201ceach periodic rate\u201d associated with the account.\r\n12 CFR \u00a7226.6(a)(2) (2008). The regulation also imposes\r\n\u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d including notice to\r\ncardholders \u201c[w]henever any term required to be disclosed\r\nunder \u00a7226.6 is changed.\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(1). This case presents\r\nthe question whether Regulation Z requires an issuer to\r\nnotify a cardholder of an interest-rate increase instituted\r\npursuant to a provision of the cardholder agreement giv\u00ad\r\ning the issuer discretion to increase the rate, up to a\r\nstated maximum, in the event of the cardholder\u2019s delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default. We conclude that the version of Reg-\r\nulation Z applicable in this case does not require such\r\nnotice.\r\n2                CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                               I\r\n\r\n                               A\r\n\r\n   Congress passed TILA to promote consumers\u2019 \u201cinformed\r\nuse of credit\u201d by requiring \u201cmeaningful disclosure of credit\r\nterms,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71601(a), and granted the Board the\r\nauthority to issue regulations to achieve TILA\u2019s purposes,\r\n\u00a71604(a). Pursuant to this authority, the Board promul\u00ad\r\ngated Regulation Z, which requires credit card issuers to\r\ndisclose certain information to consumers.1 Two provi\u00ad\r\nsions of Regulation Z are at issue in this case. The first,\r\n12 CFR \u00a7226.6, explains what information credit card\r\nissuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the\r\n\u201c[i]nitial disclosure statement,\u201d including \u201ceach periodic\r\nrate that may be used to compute the finance charge.\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.6(a)(2). The second, \u00a7226.9, imposes upon issuers\r\ncertain \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d including\r\na requirement to provide notice \u201c[w]henever any term\r\nrequired to be disclosed under \u00a7226.6 is changed.\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(1). As a general matter, notice of a change in\r\nterms has to be provided 15 days in advance of the effec\u00ad\r\ntive date of the change. Ibid. When \u201ca periodic rate or\r\nother finance charge is increased because of the con\u00ad\r\nsumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d however, notice only need\r\nbe given \u201cbefore the effective date of the change.\u201d Ibid.\r\nRegulation Z also explains that no notice is required under\r\n\u00a7226.9 when the change in terms \u201cresults from . . . the\r\nconsumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an increase\r\nin the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(2).\r\n   The official interpretation of Regulation Z (Official Staff\r\nCommentary or Commentary) promulgated by the Board\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 As discussed more fully below, see infra, at 4\u20135, in 2009 the Board\r\n\r\namended Regulation Z, such that the provisions discussed in this\r\nopinion are no longer in effect. However, because the pre-2009 provi\u00ad\r\nsions are the ones applicable to the case before us, we will refer to them\r\nin the present tense.\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexplains these requirements further: Section 226.9(c)(1)\u2019s\r\nnotice-of-change requirement does not apply \u201cif the spe\u00ad\r\ncific change is set forth initially, such as . . . an increase\r\nthat occurs when the consumer has been under an agree\u00ad\r\nment to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in\r\norder to keep a particular rate and the account balance\r\nfalls below the specified minimum.\u201d 12 CFR pt. 226, Supp.\r\nI, Comment 9(c)\u20131, p. 506 (2008) (hereinafter Comment\r\n9(c)\u20131). On the other hand, the Commentary explains,\r\n\u201cnotice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to\r\nincrease the rate at its discretion but does not include\r\nspecific terms for an increase (for example, when an in\u00ad\r\ncrease may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation\r\nright to increase the periodic rate).\u201d Ibid. As to the timing\r\nrequirements, the Commentary states: \u201c[A] notice of\r\nchange in terms is required, but it may be mailed or deliv\u00ad\r\nered as late as the effective date of the change . . . [i]f\r\nthere is an increased periodic rate or any other finance\r\ncharge attributable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\ndefault.\u201d Id., Comment 9(c)(1)\u20133, at 507 (hereinafter\r\nComment 9(c)(1)\u20133).\r\n   At least as early as 2004, the Board began considering\r\nrevisions to Regulation Z. The new regulations the Board\r\neventually issued do not apply to the present case, but the\r\ndetails of their promulgation provide useful background\r\nin considering the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the\r\nversion of Regulation Z we address here. In 2004 the\r\nBoard issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking\r\nannouncing its intent to consider revisions. 69 Fed. Reg.\r\n70925 (2004). In so doing, the Board described how it\r\nunderstood the notice requirements to function at that\r\ntime:\r\n    \u201c[A]dvance notice is not required in all cases. For ex\u00ad\r\n    ample, if the interest rate or other finance charge in\u00ad\r\n    creases due to a consumer\u2019s default or delinquency,\r\n4             CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    notice is required, but need not be given in advance.\r\n    12 CFR 226.9(c)(1); comment 9(c)(1)\u20133.         And no\r\n    change-in-terms notice is required if the creditor\r\n    specifies in advance the circumstances under which\r\n    an increase to the finance charge or an annual fee will\r\n    occur. Comment 9(c)\u20131. For example, some credit\r\n    card account agreements permit the card issuer to in\u00ad\r\n    crease the interest rate if the consumer pays late . . . .\r\n    Under Regulation Z, because the circumstances are\r\n    specified in advance in the account agreement, the\r\n    creditor need not provide a change-in-terms notice 15\r\n    days in advance of the increase; the new rate will ap\u00ad\r\n    pear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which\r\n    the increase occurs.\u201d Id., at 70931\u201370932.\r\nThe Board asked for public comment on whether these\r\n\u201cexisting disclosure rules\u201d were \u201cadequate to enable con\u00ad\r\nsumers to make timely decisions about how to manage\r\ntheir accounts.\u201d Id., at 70932.\r\n   Subsequently, in 2007, the Board published proposed\r\namendments to Regulation Z and the Commentary. 72\r\nFed. Reg. 32948. One amendment would have required 45\r\ndays\u2019 advance written notice when \u201c(i) [a] rate is increased\r\ndue to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default; or (ii) [a]\r\nrate is increased as a penalty for one or more events spec\u00ad\r\nified in the account agreement, such as making a late\r\npayment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds\r\nthe credit limit.\u201d     Id., at 33058 (proposed 12 CFR\r\n\u00a7226.9(g)). The Board explained that, under the amend\u00ad\r\nments, \u201ccreditors would no longer be permitted to provide\r\nfor the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the\r\noccurrence of certain events specified in the contract.\u201d 72\r\nFed. Reg. 33012.\r\n   In January 2009, the Board promulgated a final rule\r\nimplementing many of the proposed changes, scheduled to\r\nbe effective July 1, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 5244. Most sali\u00ad\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nently, the Board included a new provision, \u00a7226.9(g),\r\nwhich requires 45 days\u2019 advance notice of increases in\r\nrates due to cardholder delinquency or default, or as a\r\npenalty, including penalties for \u201cevents specified in the\r\naccount agreement, such as making a late payment . . . .\u201d\r\n12 CFR \u00a7226.9(g) (2010). In May 2009, Congress en\u00ad\r\nacted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and\r\nDisclosure Act (Credit CARD Act or Act), 123 Stat. 1734.\r\nThe Act amended TILA, in relevant part, to require 45\r\ndays\u2019 advance notice of most increases in credit card an\u00ad\r\nnual percentage rates. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71637(i) (2006 ed.,\r\nSupp. III). Because the Credit CARD Act\u2019s notice re\u00ad\r\nquirements with respect to interest-rate increases largely\r\nmirror the requirements in the new version of the regu-\r\nlation, the Board changed the effective date of those\r\nrequirements to August 20, 2009, to coincide with the\r\nstatutory schedule. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36077\u201336079. The\r\ntransactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case,\r\nhowever, arose prior to enactment of the Act and the\r\npromulgation of the new regulatory provisions.\r\n                            B\r\n  Respondent James A. McCoy brought this action in the\r\nSuperior Court of Orange County, California on behalf of\r\nhimself and others similarly situated against petitioner\r\nChase Bank USA, N. A.; Chase removed the action to the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71441. At the time of the\r\ntransactions at issue, McCoy was the holder of a credit\r\ncard issued by Chase. The cardholder agreement between\r\nthe parties (Agreement) provides, in relevant part, that\r\nMcCoy is eligible for \u201cPreferred rates,\u201d but that to keep\r\nsuch rates he has to meet certain conditions, including\r\nmaking \u201cat least the required minimum payments when\r\ndue on [his] Account and on all other loans or accounts\r\nwith [Chase] and [his] other creditors.\u201d Brief for Respon\u00ad\r\n6                CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndent 8, n. 2; see also 559 F. 3d 963, 972, n. 1 (CA9 2009)\r\n(Cudahy, J., dissenting). If any of the conditions in the\r\nAgreement are not met, Chase reserves the right to\r\n\u201cchange [McCoy\u2019s] interest rate and impose a Non-\r\nPreferred rate up to the maximum Non-Preferred rate\r\ndescribed in the Pricing Schedule\u201d and to apply any\r\nchanges \u201cto existing as well as new balances . . . effective\r\nwith the billing cycle ending on the review date.\u201d Brief for\r\nRespondent 8, n. 2.\r\n  McCoy\u2019s complaint alleges that Chase increased his\r\ninterest rate due to his delinquency or default, and applied\r\nthat increase retroactively. McCoy asserts that the rate\r\nincrease violates Regulation Z because, pursuant to the\r\nAgreement, Chase did not notify him of the increase until\r\nafter it had taken effect.2 The District Court dismissed\r\nMcCoy\u2019s complaint, holding that because the increase did\r\nnot constitute a \u201cchange in terms\u201d as contemplated by\r\n\u00a7226.9(c), Chase was not required to notify him of the\r\nincrease before implementing it. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\r\n37a\u201347a.\r\n  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\r\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding\r\nthat Regulation Z requires issuers to provide notice of an\r\ninterest-rate increase prior to its effective date. See 559\r\nF. 3d, at 969. Concluding that the text of Regulation Z is\r\nambiguous and that the agency commentary accompany\u00ad\r\ning the 2004 request for comments and the 2007 proposed\r\namendments favors neither party\u2019s interpretation, the\r\ncourt relied primarily on the Official Staff Commentary; in\r\nparticular, the court noted that Comment 9(c)\u20131 requires\r\nno notice of a change in terms if the \u201cspecific change\u201d at\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  2 McCoy also asserted various state-law claims that are not before us.\r\n\r\nWe note that McCoy\u2019s complaint provides little detail regarding the\r\ntransactions at issue in this case. The parties, however, are in agree\u00ad\r\nment as to the essential facts alleged.\r\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nissue is set forth in the initial agreement. See id., at 965\u2013\r\n967. The court found, however, that because the Agree\u00ad\r\nment vests Chase with discretion to impose any Non-\r\nPreferred rate it chooses (up to the specified maximum)\r\nupon McCoy\u2019s default, the Agreement \u201cprovides McCoy\r\nwith no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive\r\ninterest rate Chase will choose to charge him if he de\u00ad\r\nfaults.\u201d Id., at 967. Accordingly, the court held that be\u00ad\r\ncause the Agreement does not alert McCoy to the \u201cspecific\r\nchange\u201d that will occur if he defaults, Chase was obliged to\r\ngive notice of that change prior to its effective date. Ibid.\r\nRelying primarily on the 2004 notice of proposed rulemak\u00ad\r\ning and the 2007 proposed amendments, the dissenting\r\njudge concluded that Regulation Z does not require notice\r\nof an interest-rate increase in the circumstances of this\r\ncase. See id., at 972\u2013979 (opinion of Cudahy, J.).\r\n  After the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, the United States Court\r\nof Appeals for the First Circuit decided the same question\r\nin Chase\u2019s favor. See Shaner v. Chase Bank USA, N. A.,\r\n587 F. 3d 488 (2009). The First Circuit relied in part on\r\nan amicus brief submitted by the Board at the court\u2019s\r\nrequest, in which the agency advanced the same interpre\u00ad\r\ntation of Regulation Z that it now does before this Court.\r\nId., at 493. We granted certiorari to resolve this division\r\nin authority.3 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\r\n                             II\r\n  In order to decide this case, we must determine whether\r\nan interest-rate increase constitutes a \u201cchange in terms\u201d\r\nunder Regulation Z, when the change is made pursuant to\r\na provision in the cardholder agreement allowing the\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has also\r\n\r\nrejected the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, though on a different\r\nquestion than the one presented in this case. See Swanson v. Bank of\r\nAmerica, N. A., 559 F. 3d 653, reh\u2019g denied, 563 F. 3d 634 (2009)\r\n(disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Regulation Z).\r\n8             CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nissuer to increase the rate, up to a stated maximum, in the\r\nevent of the cardholder\u2019s delinquency or default. Accord\u00ad\r\ningly, this case calls upon us to determine the meaning of\r\na regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory\r\nauthority. The parties dispute the proper interpretation of\r\nthe regulation itself, as well as whether we should accord\r\ndeference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its regulation.\r\nAs explained below, we conclude that the text of the regu\u00ad\r\nlation is ambiguous, and that deference is warranted to\r\nthe interpretation of that text advanced by the Board in\r\nits amicus brief.\r\n                               A\r\n  Our analysis begins with the text of Regulation Z in\r\neffect at the time this dispute arose. First, \u00a7226.6 requires\r\nan \u201c[i]nitial disclosure statement\u201d:\r\n      \u201cThe creditor shall disclose to the consumer, in ter\u00ad\r\n    minology consistent with that to be used on the peri\u00ad\r\n    odic statement, each of the following items, to the\r\n    extent applicable:\r\n      \u201c(a) Finance charge.       The circumstances under\r\n    which a finance charge will be imposed and an expla\u00ad\r\n    nation of how it will be determined, as follows:\r\n        .           .           .          .          .\r\n      \u201c(2) A disclosure of each periodic rate that may be\r\n    used to compute the finance charge, the range of bal\u00ad\r\n    ances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding\r\n    annual percentage rate. When different periodic rates\r\n    apply to different types of transactions, the types of\r\n    transactions to which the periodic rates apply shall\r\n    also be disclosed.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)\r\nSecond, \u00a7226.9(c) requires certain \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure\r\nrequirements\u201d:\r\n     \u201cChange in terms\u2014(1) Written notice required.\r\n    Whenever any term required to be disclosed under\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    \u00a7226.6 is changed or the required minimum periodic\r\n    payment is increased, the creditor shall mail or de\u00ad\r\n    liver written notice of the change to each consumer\r\n    who may be affected. The notice shall be mailed or\r\n    delivered at least 15 days prior to the effective date of\r\n    the change. The 15-day timing requirement does not\r\n    apply if the change has been agreed to by the con\u00ad\r\n    sumer, or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is\r\n    increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\n    default; the notice shall be given, however, before the\r\n    effective date of the change.\r\n       \u201c(2) Notice not required. No notice under this sec\u00ad\r\n    tion is required when the change . . . results from . . .\r\n    the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an\r\n    increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d\r\n   The question is whether the increase in McCoy\u2019s inter\u00ad\r\nest rate constitutes a change to a \u201cterm required to be\r\ndisclosed under \u00a7226.6,\u201d requiring a subsequent disclosure\r\nunder \u00a7226.9(c)(1). One of the initial terms that must be\r\ndisclosed under \u00a7226.6 is \u201ceach periodic rate that may be\r\nused to compute the finance charge . . . and the corre\u00ad\r\nsponding annual percentage rate.\u201d \u00a7226.6(a)(2). McCoy\r\nargues that, because an increase in the interest rate in\u00ad\r\ncreases the \u201cperiodic rate\u201d applicable to his account, such\r\nan increase constitutes a change in terms within the\r\nmeaning of \u00a7226.9(c)(1). As further support, McCoy points\r\nto two provisions in \u00a7226.9(c): first, that notice of an in\u00ad\r\ncrease in the interest rate must be provided \u201cbefore the\r\neffective date of the change\u201d when the increase is due to\r\n\u201cthe consumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(1); and\r\nsecond, that no notice is required of a change resulting\r\n\u201cfrom the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than\r\nan increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge),\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(2).   Accordingly, because \u00a7226.9(c) includes\r\ninterest-rate increases due to delinquency or default,\r\n10               CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nMcCoy argues that the plain text of the regulation indi\u00ad\r\ncates that a change in the periodic rate due to such default\r\nis a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice under \u00a7226.9(c)(1).\r\n   We recognize that McCoy\u2019s argument has some force;\r\nread in isolation, the language quoted above certainly\r\nsuggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an\r\ninterest-rate increase imposed pursuant to cardholder\r\ndelinquency or default. But McCoy\u2019s analysis begs the key\r\nquestion: whether the increase actually changed a \u201cterm\u201d\r\nof the Agreement that was \u201crequired to be disclosed under\r\n\u00a7226.6.\u201d If not, \u00a7226.9(c)\u2019s subsequent notice requirement\r\nwith respect to a \u201cchange in terms\u201d does not apply. Chase\r\nargues precisely this: The increase did not change a term\r\nin the Agreement, but merely implemented one that had\r\nbeen initially disclosed, as required. This interpretation,\r\nthough not commanded by the text of the regulation, is\r\nreasonable. Section 226.6(a)(2) requires initial disclosure\r\nof \u201ceach periodic rate that may be used to compute the\r\nfinance charge.\u201d The Agreement itself discloses both the\r\ninitial rate (Preferred rate) and the maximum rate to be\r\nimposed in the event of default (Non-Preferred rate). See\r\nBrief for Respondent 8, n. 2; Brief for Petitioner 13\u201314.4\r\nAccordingly, it is plausible to understand the Agreement\r\nto initially disclose \u201ceach periodic rate\u201d to be applied to the\r\naccount, and Chase arguably did not \u201cchange\u201d those rates\r\nas a result of McCoy\u2019s default. Instead, Chase merely\r\nimplemented the previously disclosed term specifying the\r\nNon-Preferred rate.5\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  4 The Pricing Schedule referred to in the Agreement is not contained\r\nin the case record, nor are its contents apparent from the parties\u2019 briefs,\r\nbut neither side disputes that it specified a maximum Non-Preferred\r\nrate applicable to the Agreement.\r\n   5 We are not persuaded by McCoy\u2019s argument that, although Chase\r\n\r\ndid not change a \u201ccontract term\u201d when it raised his interest rate pursu\u00ad\r\nant to the terms of the Agreement, it changed a \u201ccredit term,\u201d thereby\r\ntriggering \u00a7226.9(c)\u2019s notice requirement.

S. ____ (2011)                   11\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   This reading still leaves the question why \u00a7226.9(c)(1)\r\nrefers to interest-rate increases resulting from delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default if such increases do not constitute a\r\n\u201cchange in terms.\u201d One reasonable explanation Chase\r\noffers is that \u00a7226.9(c)(1) refers to interest-rate increases\r\nthat were not specifically outlined in the agreement\u2019s\r\ninitial terms (unlike those in the present Agreement). For\r\nexample, credit card agreements routinely include a \u201cres\u00ad\r\nervation of rights\u201d provision giving the issuer discretion to\r\nchange the terms of the contract, often as a means of\r\nresponding to events that raise doubts about the card\u00ad\r\nholder\u2019s creditworthiness. An issuer may exercise this\r\ngeneral contract-modification authority and raise the\r\ninterest rate applicable to the account to address any\r\nheightened risk. See Brief for Petitioner 6. In such a case,\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(1) is best read to require that notice must be\r\ngiven prior to the effective date of the increase, because\r\nthe unilateral increase instituted by the issuer actually\r\nchanged a term\u2014the interest rate\u2014in a manner not spe\u00ad\r\ncifically contemplated by the agreement.6 See Comment\r\n9(c)\u20131 (providing that notice is required if the agreement\r\n\u201cdoes not include specific terms for an increase (for exam\u00ad\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ntion Z does not refer to, let alone distinguish between, \u201ccontract terms\u201d\r\nand \u201ccredit terms,\u201d and McCoy\u2019s repeated citations to TILA\u2019s broad\r\npolicy statement do not convince us that such a distinction is war\u00ad\r\nranted. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71601(a) (\u201cIt is the purpose of this subchapter\r\nto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer\r\nwill be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available\r\nto him and avoid the uninformed use of credit\u201d).\r\n   6 The Government offers an alternative example. Assume that the\r\n\r\nagreement is similar to the one at issue here, with a specified maxi\u00ad\r\nmum level to which the interest rate can be increased if the cardholder\r\ndefaults. If default occurs but the issuer raises the rate above the\r\ncontractual maximum, notice must be given prior to the effective date\r\nbecause the issuer actually changed the term of the contract initially\r\nspecifying the maximum rate possible. See Brief for United States as\r\nAmicus Curiae 14\u201315.\r\n12            CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v.

We need not decide which party\u2019s\r\ninterpretation is more persuasive, however; both are\r\nplausible, and the text alone does not permit a more de\u00ad\r\nfinitive reading. Accordingly, we find Regulation Z to be\r\nambiguous as to the question presented, and must there\u00ad\r\nfore look to the Board\u2019s own interpretation of the regula\u00ad\r\ntion for guidance in deciding this case.

S., at\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  7 We note that, in reaching its decision, the Ninth Circuit did not\r\n\r\nhave the benefit of briefing from the Board. The Ninth Circuit appar\u00ad\r\nently did not solicit the views of the Board in the proceedings below, see\r\nBrief for Petitioner 16, and the First Circuit did not solicit the Board\u2019s\r\nviews in Shaner v. Chase Bank USA, N.

A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n461\u2013462. Responding to the petitioners\u2019 objection that the\r\nagency\u2019s interpretation came in a legal brief, we held that\r\nthis fact did not, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, make\r\nit unworthy of deference.\u201d Id., at 462. We observed that\r\n\u201c[t]he Secretary\u2019s position is in no sense a \u2018post hoc ration\u00ad\r\nalizatio[n]\u2019 advanced by an agency seeking to defend past\r\nagency action against attack.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.\r\nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988)). We\r\nadded: \u201cThere is simply no reason to suspect that the\r\ninterpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and con\u00ad\r\nsidered judgment on the matter in question.\u201d Auer, 519\r\nU. S., at 462.\r\n   The brief submitted by the Board in the present case, at\r\nour invitation, is no different. As in Auer, there is no\r\nreason to believe that the interpretation advanced by the\r\nBoard is a \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d taken as a litigation\r\nposition. The Board is not a party to this case. And as is\r\nevident from our discussion of Regulation Z itself, see Part\r\nII\u2013A, supra, the Board\u2019s interpretation is neither \u201cplainly\r\nerroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the indeterminate text\r\nof the regulation. In short, there is no reason to suspect\r\nthat the position the Board takes in its amicus brief re\u00ad\r\nflects anything other than the agency\u2019s fair and considered\r\njudgment as to what the regulation required at the time\r\nthis dispute arose.\r\n   McCoy may well be correct in asserting that it is better\r\npolicy to oblige credit-card issuers to give advance notice\r\nof a rate increase; after all, both Congress and the Board\r\nhave recently indicated that such a requirement is war\u00ad\r\nranted. See Credit CARD Act, \u00a7101(a)(1), 123 Stat. 1735\u2013\r\n1736; 12 CFR \u00a7226.9(g) (2009). That Congress and the\r\nBoard may currently hold such views does not mean,\r\nhowever, that deference is not warranted to the Board\u2019s\r\ndifferent understanding of what the pre-2009 version of\r\nRegulation Z required. To the contrary, the interpretation\r\nthe Board advances in its amicus brief is entirely consis\u00ad\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntent with its past views. The 2004 notice of rulemaking\r\nand the 2007 proposed amendments to Regulation Z make\r\nclear that, prior to 2009, the Board\u2019s fair and considered\r\njudgment was that \u201cno change-in-terms notice is required\r\nif the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances\r\nunder which an increase . . . will occur,\u201d 69 Fed. Reg.\r\n70931, and \u201cimmediate application of penalty pricing upon\r\nthe occurrence of certain events specified in the contract\u201d\r\nwas permissible, 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.\r\n   Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the\r\ninterpretation in the Board\u2019s amicus brief is warranted.\r\nThe cases McCoy cites in which we declined to apply Auer\r\ndo not suggest that deference is unwarranted here. In\r\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), we declined to\r\ndefer because\u2014in sharp contrast to the present case\u2014\r\nthe regulation in question did \u201clittle more than restate the\r\nterms of the statute\u201d pursuant to which the regulation was\r\npromulgated. Id., at 257. Accordingly, no deference was\r\nwarranted to an agency interpretation of what were, in\r\nfact, Congress\u2019 words. Ibid. In contrast, at the time of the\r\ntransactions in this case, TILA itself included no require\u00ad\r\nments with respect to the disclosure of a change in credit\r\nterms. In Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576\r\n(2000), we declined to apply Auer deference because the\r\nregulation in question was unambiguous, and adopting the\r\nagency\u2019s contrary interpretation would \u201cpermit the agency,\r\nunder the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de\r\nfacto a new regulation.\u201d 529 U. S., at 588. In light of\r\nRegulation Z\u2019s ambiguity, there is no such danger here.\r\nAnd our statement in Christensen that \u201cdeference is war\u00ad\r\nranted only when the language of the regulation is am\u00ad\r\nbiguous,\u201d ibid., is perfectly consonant with Auer itself; if\r\nthe text of a regulation is unambiguous, a conflicting\r\nagency interpretation advanced in an amicus brief will\r\nnecessarily be \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\r\nregulation\u201d in question.

Accordingly, under our prece\u00ad\r\ndent deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own\r\nregulation, as presented in the agency\u2019s amicus brief, is\r\nwholly appropriate.\r\n                             C\r\n  McCoy further argues that deference to a legal brief is\r\ninappropriate because the interpretation of Regulation Z\r\nin the Official Staff Commentary commands a different\r\nresult. To be sure, the Official Staff Commentary promul\u00ad\r\ngated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z\r\nmay warrant deference as a general matter. See Anderson\r\nBros. Ford v. Valencia, 452 U. S. 205, 219 (1981) (holding\r\nthat \u201cthe Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation\u201d\r\nshould generally \u201cbe accepted by the courts\u201d); Milhollin,\r\n444 U.

We find, however,\r\nthat the Commentary at issue here largely replicates the\r\nambiguity present in the regulatory text, and therefore it\r\noffers us nothing to which we can defer with respect to the\r\nprecise interpretive question before us.9 Cf. Smith v.

[i]f there is an\r\nincreased periodic rate or any other finance charge attri\u00ad\r\nbutable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default.\u201d This\r\nexposition of the regulation does not add any clarity to the\r\nregulatory text, which expresses the same requirement.\r\nSee \u00a7226.9(c)(1) (2008) (\u201c[I]f a periodic rate or other fi\u00ad\r\nnance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default . . . notice shall be given . . . before the\r\neffective date of the change\u201d). And like \u00a7226.9(c), Com\u00ad\r\nment 9(c) is entitled \u201cChange in terms.\u201d Accordingly,\r\nChase\u2019s plausible interpretation of \u00a7226.9(c)(1) is equally\r\napplicable to Comment 9(c)(1)\u20133: On Chase\u2019s view, be\u00ad\r\ncause the interest-rate increase at issue in this case did\r\nnot constitute a \u201cchange in terms,\u201d the disclosure require\u00ad\r\nments in the regulation and Commentary simply do not\r\ncome into play. See supra, at 10\u201311.\r\n   Comment 9(c)\u20131 is also ambiguous, though the most\r\nplausible reading supports Chase\u2019s position more than it\r\ndoes McCoy\u2019s. The Comment begins: \u201cNo notice of a\r\nchange in terms need be given if the specific change is set\r\nforth initially\u201d in the agreement. We do not find that the\r\nComment\u2019s addition of the modifier \u201cspecific\u201d to the word\r\n\u201cchange\u201d enables us to determine, any more than we could\r\nin light of the text of the regulation, see supra, at 12,\r\nwhether the interest-rate increase at issue in this case\r\nwas a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice. According to\r\nChase, as long as the agreement explains that delinquency\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\r\nissue authoritative interpretations for other purposes. \r\n\r\n18               CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nor default might trigger an increased interest rate and\r\nstates the maximum level to which the rate could be in\u00ad\r\ncreased, the \u201cspecific change\u201d that ensues upon default has\r\nbeen set forth initially and no additional notice is required\r\nbefore implementation. McCoy argues to the contrary:\r\nUnder Comment 9(c)\u20131, any new rate imposed after delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default must be disclosed prior to the effective\r\ndate, if the particular rate (rather than the maximum\r\nrate) was not specifically mentioned in the agreement. On\r\nthe whole, then, the Official Staff Commentary\u2019s explana\u00ad\r\ntion of Regulation Z does not resolve the uncertainty in the\r\nregulatory text, and offers us no reason to disregard\r\nthe interpretation advanced in the Board\u2019s amicus brief.10\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   10 In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit focused on the examples\r\n\r\nComment 9(c)\u20131 provides of changes that, if set forth initially, require\r\nno further disclosure when put into effect:\r\n\u201cNo notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is\r\nset forth initially, such as: Rate increases under a properly disclosed\r\nvariable-rate plan, a rate increase that occurs when an employee has\r\nbeen under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment,\r\nor an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an\r\nagreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order\r\nto keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the\r\nspecified minimum.\u201d\r\n   The Ninth Circuit concluded that, in contrast to each of these three\r\nexamples, \u201cthe increase here occurs at Chase\u2019s discretion.\u201d 559 F. 3d\r\n963, 966 (2009). That is, once the triggering event\u2014McCoy\u2019s default\u2014\r\noccurred, Chase had the latitude to increase the interest rate as it saw\r\nfit (up to the limit specified in the Pricing Schedule).\r\n   We are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Certainly,\r\nunder a \u201cvariable-rate\u201d plan the interest rate fluctuates according to an\r\nexternal variable easily discernable by the cardholder (like the Federal\r\nPrime rate), and the issuer has no discretion. See ibid. But the Com\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s second and third examples do not appear to be significantly\r\ndifferent from this case: The agreement contains a preset rate, but it\r\nalso provides that, on the occurrence of a predefined event (terminating\r\nemployment or a low account balance), the rate will increase.\r\n   Moreover, Comment 9(c)\u20131 further states that notice is needed \u201cif the\r\ncontract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but\r\ndoes not include specific terms for an increase\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cwhen an\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

We are not convinced.\r\nMcCoy may be correct that the Board established the\r\nOfficial Staff Commentary so as to centralize its opinion\u00ad\r\nmaking process and avoid \u201coverburdening the industry\r\nwith excessive detail and multiple research sources.\u201d 46\r\nFed. Reg. 50288. But his suggestion that, if we accord\r\ndeference to an amicus brief, all other \u201cunofficial\u201d sources\r\nwill be fair game is of no moment. Today we decide only\r\nthat the amicus brief submitted by the Board is entitled to\r\ndeference in light of \u201cthe circumstances of this case.\u201d\r\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 462.\r\n  Accordingly, we conclude that, at the time of the trans\u00ad\r\nactions at issue in this case, Regulation Z did not require\r\nChase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice\r\nbefore it implemented the Agreement term allowing it to\r\nraise his interest rate following delinquency or default.\r\n                        *   *    *\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed,\r\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consis\u00ad\r\ntent with this opinion.\r\n                                          It is so ordered.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nincrease may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation right to\r\nincrease the periodic rate.\u201d It would seem that the narrower latitude\r\nChase had under the Agreement to set the precise new rate within a\r\nspecified range after McCoy defaulted is not the kind of \u201cdiscretion\u201d the\r\nlast example of Comment 9(c)\u20131 contemplates. In short, analogizing to\r\nthe Comment\u2019s examples suggests that Chase\u2019s action in setting a new\r\nrate was most likely a \u201cspecific change\u201d that the Agreement itself\r\ncontemplated, and subsequent disclosure was not clearly required.\r\n",

Argued December 8, 2010\u2014Decided January 24, 2011\r\nRegulation Z\u2014promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board (Board) pur\r\n  suant to its authority under the Truth in Lending Act\u2014requires\r\n  credit card issuers to disclose certain information to cardholders. The\r\n  version of the regulation in effect at the time this dispute arose\r\n  obliges issuers to provide to cardholders an \u201c[i]nitial disclosure\r\n  statement,\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7226.6, specifying \u201ceach periodic rate that may\r\n  be used to compute the finance charge,\u201d \u00a7226.6(a)(2). It also imposes\r\n  \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d \u00a7226.9, including notice to\r\n  cardholders \u201c[w]henever any term required to be disclosed under\r\n  \u00a7226.6 is changed,\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(1). When \u201ca periodic rate or other fi\r\n  nance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\n  default,\u201d notice must be given \u201cbefore the effective date of the\r\n  change.\u201d Ibid.\r\n     At the time respondent McCoy filed suit, he was the holder of a\r\n  credit card issued by petitioner Chase Bank. The cardholder agree\r\n  ment provided, in relevant part, that McCoy was eligible for \u201cPre\r\n  ferred rates\u201d as long as he met certain conditions. If any of those\r\n  conditions were not met, Chase reserved the right to raise the rate,\r\n  up to a pre-set maximum, and to apply the change to both existing\r\n  and new balances. McCoy alleges that Chase increased his interest\r\n  rate due to his delinquency or default and applied that increase ret\r\n  roactively, and that this action violated Regulation Z because Chase\r\n  did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect. The\r\n  District Court dismissed his complaint, holding that because the in\r\n  crease did not constitute a \u201cchange in terms\u201d under \u00a7226.9(c), Chase\r\n  was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that Regulation\r\n2                  CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    Z requires issuers to provide notice of an interest-rate increase prior\r\n    to its effective date.\r\nHeld: At the time of the transactions at issue, Regulation Z did not re\r\n quire Chase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice before\r\n implementing the agreement term allowing it to raise his interest\r\n rate, up to a pre-set maximum, following delinquency or default.\r\n Pp. 7\u201319.\r\n    (a) This case requires the Court to determine the meaning of a\r\n regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory authority.\r\n However, Regulation Z\u2019s text is unclear with respect to the crucial in\r\n terpretive question at issue: whether a change to an interest rate,\r\n pursuant to previously-disclosed contractual provision, constitutes a\r\n change to a \u201cterm required to be disclosed under \u00a7226.6\u201d requiring a\r\n subsequent disclosure under \u00a7226.9(c)(1). Because of this ambiguity,\r\n the Court must look to the Board\u2019s own interpretation of the regula\r\n tion for guidance in deciding this case. Pp. 7\u201312.\r\n    (b) The Board has made clear in its amicus brief to this Court that,\r\n in its view, Chase was not required to give McCoy notice of the inter\r\n est rate increase under the applicable version of Regulation Z. This\r\n Court defers to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, ad\r\n vanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is \u201cplainly errone\r\n ous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S.\r\n 452, 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Auer, the Court de\r\n ferred to the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of his own regula\r\n tion, presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at the\r\n Court\u2019s invitation. The Court held that the fact that the interpreta\r\n tion came in a legal brief did not, \u201cin the circumstances of th[at] case,\r\n make it unworthy of deference.\u201d Id., at 462. The interpretation was\r\n \u201cin no sense a post hoc rationalization advanced by an agency seeking\r\n to defend past agency action against attack,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation\r\n marks and alteration omitted), and there was \u201cno reason to suspect\r\n that the interpretation [did] not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and consid\r\n ered judgment on the matter in question,\u201d ibid. The brief submitted\r\n by the Board here, at the Court\u2019s invitation, is no different. As in\r\n Auer, there is no reason to believe that the Board\u2019s interpretation is a\r\n \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d taken as a litigation position, for the Board\r\n is not a party to this case. And its interpretation is neither \u201cplainly\r\n erroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the indeterminate text of Regula\r\n tion Z. Thus, there is no reason to suspect that the Board\u2019s position\r\n in its amicus brief reflects anything other than its fair and considered\r\n judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute\r\n arose. That Congress and the Board may currently hold a different\r\n view does not mean that deference is not warranted to the Board\u2019s\r\n understanding of what the applicable version of Regulation Z re\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the inter\r\n  pretation in the agency amicus brief is warranted. Pp. 12\u201316.\r\n     (c) McCoy errs in arguing that deference to a legal brief is inappro\r\n  priate because the interpretation of Regulation Z in the Official Staff\r\n  Commentary commands a different result. While Commentary\r\n  promulgated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z may\r\n  warrant deference as a general matter, the Commentary explaining\r\n  the requirements at issue in this case largely replicates the ambigu\r\n  ity present in the regulatory text, and therefore offers no reason to\r\n  disregard the interpretation advanced in the Board\u2019s amicus brief.\r\n  Pp. 16\u201319.\r\n559 F. 3d 963, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\r\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. \u00a71601(a), and granted the Board the\r\nauthority to issue regulations to achieve TILA\u2019s purposes,\r\n\u00a71604(a). Pursuant to this authority, the Board promul\u00ad\r\ngated Regulation Z, which requires credit card issuers to\r\ndisclose certain information to consumers.1 Two provi\u00ad\r\nsions of Regulation Z are at issue in this case. The first,\r\n12 CFR \u00a7226.6, explains what information credit card\r\nissuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the\r\n\u201c[i]nitial disclosure statement,\u201d including \u201ceach periodic\r\nrate that may be used to compute the finance charge.\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.6(a)(2). The second, \u00a7226.9, imposes upon issuers\r\ncertain \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d including\r\na requirement to provide notice \u201c[w]henever any term\r\nrequired to be disclosed under \u00a7226.6 is changed.\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(1). As a general matter, notice of a change in\r\nterms has to be provided 15 days in advance of the effec\u00ad\r\ntive date of the change. Ibid. When \u201ca periodic rate or\r\nother finance charge is increased because of the con\u00ad\r\nsumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d however, notice only need\r\nbe given \u201cbefore the effective date of the change.\u201d Ibid.\r\nRegulation Z also explains that no notice is required under\r\n\u00a7226.9 when the change in terms \u201cresults from . . . the\r\nconsumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an increase\r\nin the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(2).\r\n   The official interpretation of Regulation Z (Official Staff\r\nCommentary or Commentary) promulgated by the Board\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 As discussed more fully below, see infra, at 4\u20135, in 2009 the Board\r\n\r\namended Regulation Z, such that the provisions discussed in this\r\nopinion are no longer in effect. However, because the pre-2009 provi\u00ad\r\nsions are the ones applicable to the case before us, we will refer to them\r\nin the present tense.\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexplains these requirements further: Section 226.9(c)(1)\u2019s\r\nnotice-of-change requirement does not apply \u201cif the spe\u00ad\r\ncific change is set forth initially, such as . . . an increase\r\nthat occurs when the consumer has been under an agree\u00ad\r\nment to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in\r\norder to keep a particular rate and the account balance\r\nfalls below the specified minimum.\u201d 12 CFR pt. 226, Supp.\r\nI, Comment 9(c)\u20131, p. 506 (2008) (hereinafter Comment\r\n9(c)\u20131). On the other hand, the Commentary explains,\r\n\u201cnotice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to\r\nincrease the rate at its discretion but does not include\r\nspecific terms for an increase (for example, when an in\u00ad\r\ncrease may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation\r\nright to increase the periodic rate).\u201d Ibid. As to the timing\r\nrequirements, the Commentary states: \u201c[A] notice of\r\nchange in terms is required, but it may be mailed or deliv\u00ad\r\nered as late as the effective date of the change . . . [i]f\r\nthere is an increased periodic rate or any other finance\r\ncharge attributable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\ndefault.\u201d Id., Comment 9(c)(1)\u20133, at 507 (hereinafter\r\nComment 9(c)(1)\u20133).\r\n   At least as early as 2004, the Board began considering\r\nrevisions to Regulation Z. The new regulations the Board\r\neventually issued do not apply to the present case, but the\r\ndetails of their promulgation provide useful background\r\nin considering the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the\r\nversion of Regulation Z we address here. In 2004 the\r\nBoard issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking\r\nannouncing its intent to consider revisions. 69 Fed. Reg.\r\n70925 (2004). In so doing, the Board described how it\r\nunderstood the notice requirements to function at that\r\ntime:\r\n    \u201c[A]dvance notice is not required in all cases. For ex\u00ad\r\n    ample, if the interest rate or other finance charge in\u00ad\r\n    creases due to a consumer\u2019s default or delinquency,\r\n4             CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    notice is required, but need not be given in advance.\r\n    12 CFR 226.9(c)(1); comment 9(c)(1)\u20133.         And no\r\n    change-in-terms notice is required if the creditor\r\n    specifies in advance the circumstances under which\r\n    an increase to the finance charge or an annual fee will\r\n    occur. Comment 9(c)\u20131. For example, some credit\r\n    card account agreements permit the card issuer to in\u00ad\r\n    crease the interest rate if the consumer pays late . . . .\r\n    Under Regulation Z, because the circumstances are\r\n    specified in advance in the account agreement, the\r\n    creditor need not provide a change-in-terms notice 15\r\n    days in advance of the increase; the new rate will ap\u00ad\r\n    pear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which\r\n    the increase occurs.\u201d Id., at 70931\u201370932.\r\nThe Board asked for public comment on whether these\r\n\u201cexisting disclosure rules\u201d were \u201cadequate to enable con\u00ad\r\nsumers to make timely decisions about how to manage\r\ntheir accounts.\u201d Id., at 70932.\r\n   Subsequently, in 2007, the Board published proposed\r\namendments to Regulation Z and the Commentary. 72\r\nFed. Reg. 32948. One amendment would have required 45\r\ndays\u2019 advance written notice when \u201c(i) [a] rate is increased\r\ndue to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default; or (ii) [a]\r\nrate is increased as a penalty for one or more events spec\u00ad\r\nified in the account agreement, such as making a late\r\npayment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds\r\nthe credit limit.\u201d     Id., at 33058 (proposed 12 CFR\r\n\u00a7226.9(g)). The Board explained that, under the amend\u00ad\r\nments, \u201ccreditors would no longer be permitted to provide\r\nfor the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the\r\noccurrence of certain events specified in the contract.\u201d 72\r\nFed. Reg. 33012.\r\n   In January 2009, the Board promulgated a final rule\r\nimplementing many of the proposed changes, scheduled to\r\nbe effective July 1, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 5244.

In May 2009, Congress en\u00ad\r\nacted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and\r\nDisclosure Act (Credit CARD Act or Act), 123 Stat. 1734.\r\nThe Act amended TILA, in relevant part, to require 45\r\ndays\u2019 advance notice of most increases in credit card an\u00ad\r\nnual percentage rates. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71637(i) (2006 ed.,\r\nSupp. III). Because the Credit CARD Act\u2019s notice re\u00ad\r\nquirements with respect to interest-rate increases largely\r\nmirror the requirements in the new version of the regu-\r\nlation, the Board changed the effective date of those\r\nrequirements to August 20, 2009, to coincide with the\r\nstatutory schedule. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36077\u201336079. The\r\ntransactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case,\r\nhowever, arose prior to enactment of the Act and the\r\npromulgation of the new regulatory provisions.\r\n                            B\r\n  Respondent James A. McCoy brought this action in the\r\nSuperior Court of Orange County, California on behalf of\r\nhimself and others similarly situated against petitioner\r\nChase Bank USA, N. A.; Chase removed the action to the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71441. At the time of the\r\ntransactions at issue, McCoy was the holder of a credit\r\ncard issued by Chase. The cardholder agreement between\r\nthe parties (Agreement) provides, in relevant part, that\r\nMcCoy is eligible for \u201cPreferred rates,\u201d but that to keep\r\nsuch rates he has to meet certain conditions, including\r\nmaking \u201cat least the required minimum payments when\r\ndue on [his] Account and on all other loans or accounts\r\nwith [Chase] and [his] other creditors.\u201d Brief for Respon\u00ad\r\n6                CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndent 8, n. 2; see also 559 F. 3d 963, 972, n. 1 (CA9 2009)\r\n(Cudahy, J., dissenting). If any of the conditions in the\r\nAgreement are not met, Chase reserves the right to\r\n\u201cchange [McCoy\u2019s] interest rate and impose a Non-\r\nPreferred rate up to the maximum Non-Preferred rate\r\ndescribed in the Pricing Schedule\u201d and to apply any\r\nchanges \u201cto existing as well as new balances . . . effective\r\nwith the billing cycle ending on the review date.\u201d Brief for\r\nRespondent 8, n. 2.\r\n  McCoy\u2019s complaint alleges that Chase increased his\r\ninterest rate due to his delinquency or default, and applied\r\nthat increase retroactively. McCoy asserts that the rate\r\nincrease violates Regulation Z because, pursuant to the\r\nAgreement, Chase did not notify him of the increase until\r\nafter it had taken effect.2 The District Court dismissed\r\nMcCoy\u2019s complaint, holding that because the increase did\r\nnot constitute a \u201cchange in terms\u201d as contemplated by\r\n\u00a7226.9(c), Chase was not required to notify him of the\r\nincrease before implementing it. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\r\n37a\u201347a.\r\n  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\r\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding\r\nthat Regulation Z requires issuers to provide notice of an\r\ninterest-rate increase prior to its effective date. See 559\r\nF. 3d, at 969. Concluding that the text of Regulation Z is\r\nambiguous and that the agency commentary accompany\u00ad\r\ning the 2004 request for comments and the 2007 proposed\r\namendments favors neither party\u2019s interpretation, the\r\ncourt relied primarily on the Official Staff Commentary; in\r\nparticular, the court noted that Comment 9(c)\u20131 requires\r\nno notice of a change in terms if the \u201cspecific change\u201d at\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  2 McCoy also asserted various state-law claims that are not before us.\r\n\r\nWe note that McCoy\u2019s complaint provides little detail regarding the\r\ntransactions at issue in this case. The parties, however, are in agree\u00ad\r\nment as to the essential facts alleged.\r\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nissue is set forth in the initial agreement. See id., at 965\u2013\r\n967. The court found, however, that because the Agree\u00ad\r\nment vests Chase with discretion to impose any Non-\r\nPreferred rate it chooses (up to the specified maximum)\r\nupon McCoy\u2019s default, the Agreement \u201cprovides McCoy\r\nwith no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive\r\ninterest rate Chase will choose to charge him if he de\u00ad\r\nfaults.\u201d Id., at 967. Accordingly, the court held that be\u00ad\r\ncause the Agreement does not alert McCoy to the \u201cspecific\r\nchange\u201d that will occur if he defaults, Chase was obliged to\r\ngive notice of that change prior to its effective date. Ibid.\r\nRelying primarily on the 2004 notice of proposed rulemak\u00ad\r\ning and the 2007 proposed amendments, the dissenting\r\njudge concluded that Regulation Z does not require notice\r\nof an interest-rate increase in the circumstances of this\r\ncase. See id., at 972\u2013979 (opinion of Cudahy, J.).\r\n  After the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, the United States Court\r\nof Appeals for the First Circuit decided the same question\r\nin Chase\u2019s favor. See Shaner v. Chase Bank USA, N. A.,\r\n587 F. 3d 488 (2009). The First Circuit relied in part on\r\nan amicus brief submitted by the Board at the court\u2019s\r\nrequest, in which the agency advanced the same interpre\u00ad\r\ntation of Regulation Z that it now does before this Court.\r\nId., at 493. We granted certiorari to resolve this division\r\nin authority.3 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\r\n                             II\r\n  In order to decide this case, we must determine whether\r\nan interest-rate increase constitutes a \u201cchange in terms\u201d\r\nunder Regulation Z, when the change is made pursuant to\r\na provision in the cardholder agreement allowing the\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has also\r\n\r\nrejected the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, though on a different\r\nquestion than the one presented in this case. See Swanson v. Bank of\r\nAmerica, N. A., 559 F. 3d 653, reh\u2019g denied, 563 F. 3d 634 (2009)\r\n(disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Regulation Z).\r\n8             CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nissuer to increase the rate, up to a stated maximum, in the\r\nevent of the cardholder\u2019s delinquency or default. Accord\u00ad\r\ningly, this case calls upon us to determine the meaning of\r\na regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory\r\nauthority. The parties dispute the proper interpretation of\r\nthe regulation itself, as well as whether we should accord\r\ndeference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its regulation.\r\nAs explained below, we conclude that the text of the regu\u00ad\r\nlation is ambiguous, and that deference is warranted to\r\nthe interpretation of that text advanced by the Board in\r\nits amicus brief.\r\n                               A\r\n  Our analysis begins with the text of Regulation Z in\r\neffect at the time this dispute arose. First, \u00a7226.6 requires\r\nan \u201c[i]nitial disclosure statement\u201d:\r\n      \u201cThe creditor shall disclose to the consumer, in ter\u00ad\r\n    minology consistent with that to be used on the peri\u00ad\r\n    odic statement, each of the following items, to the\r\n    extent applicable:\r\n      \u201c(a) Finance charge.       The circumstances under\r\n    which a finance charge will be imposed and an expla\u00ad\r\n    nation of how it will be determined, as follows:\r\n        .           .           .          .          .\r\n      \u201c(2) A disclosure of each periodic rate that may be\r\n    used to compute the finance charge, the range of bal\u00ad\r\n    ances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding\r\n    annual percentage rate. When different periodic rates\r\n    apply to different types of transactions, the types of\r\n    transactions to which the periodic rates apply shall\r\n    also be disclosed.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)\r\nSecond, \u00a7226.9(c) requires certain \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure\r\nrequirements\u201d:\r\n     \u201cChange in terms\u2014(1) Written notice required.\r\n    Whenever any term required to be disclosed under\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    \u00a7226.6 is changed or the required minimum periodic\r\n    payment is increased, the creditor shall mail or de\u00ad\r\n    liver written notice of the change to each consumer\r\n    who may be affected. The notice shall be mailed or\r\n    delivered at least 15 days prior to the effective date of\r\n    the change. The 15-day timing requirement does not\r\n    apply if the change has been agreed to by the con\u00ad\r\n    sumer, or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is\r\n    increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or\r\n    default; the notice shall be given, however, before the\r\n    effective date of the change.\r\n       \u201c(2) Notice not required. No notice under this sec\u00ad\r\n    tion is required when the change . . . results from . . .\r\n    the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an\r\n    increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d\r\n   The question is whether the increase in McCoy\u2019s inter\u00ad\r\nest rate constitutes a change to a \u201cterm required to be\r\ndisclosed under \u00a7226.6,\u201d requiring a subsequent disclosure\r\nunder \u00a7226.9(c)(1). One of the initial terms that must be\r\ndisclosed under \u00a7226.6 is \u201ceach periodic rate that may be\r\nused to compute the finance charge . . . and the corre\u00ad\r\nsponding annual percentage rate.\u201d \u00a7226.6(a)(2). McCoy\r\nargues that, because an increase in the interest rate in\u00ad\r\ncreases the \u201cperiodic rate\u201d applicable to his account, such\r\nan increase constitutes a change in terms within the\r\nmeaning of \u00a7226.9(c)(1). As further support, McCoy points\r\nto two provisions in \u00a7226.9(c): first, that notice of an in\u00ad\r\ncrease in the interest rate must be provided \u201cbefore the\r\neffective date of the change\u201d when the increase is due to\r\n\u201cthe consumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d \u00a7226.9(c)(1); and\r\nsecond, that no notice is required of a change resulting\r\n\u201cfrom the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than\r\nan increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge),\u201d\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(2).   Accordingly, because \u00a7226.9(c) includes\r\ninterest-rate increases due to delinquency or default,\r\n10               CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nMcCoy argues that the plain text of the regulation indi\u00ad\r\ncates that a change in the periodic rate due to such default\r\nis a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice under \u00a7226.9(c)(1).\r\n   We recognize that McCoy\u2019s argument has some force;\r\nread in isolation, the language quoted above certainly\r\nsuggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an\r\ninterest-rate increase imposed pursuant to cardholder\r\ndelinquency or default. But McCoy\u2019s analysis begs the key\r\nquestion: whether the increase actually changed a \u201cterm\u201d\r\nof the Agreement that was \u201crequired to be disclosed under\r\n\u00a7226.6.\u201d If not, \u00a7226.9(c)\u2019s subsequent notice requirement\r\nwith respect to a \u201cchange in terms\u201d does not apply. Chase\r\nargues precisely this: The increase did not change a term\r\nin the Agreement, but merely implemented one that had\r\nbeen initially disclosed, as required. This interpretation,\r\nthough not commanded by the text of the regulation, is\r\nreasonable. Section 226.6(a)(2) requires initial disclosure\r\nof \u201ceach periodic rate that may be used to compute the\r\nfinance charge.\u201d The Agreement itself discloses both the\r\ninitial rate (Preferred rate) and the maximum rate to be\r\nimposed in the event of default (Non-Preferred rate). See\r\nBrief for Respondent 8, n. 2; Brief for Petitioner 13\u201314.4\r\nAccordingly, it is plausible to understand the Agreement\r\nto initially disclose \u201ceach periodic rate\u201d to be applied to the\r\naccount, and Chase arguably did not \u201cchange\u201d those rates\r\nas a result of McCoy\u2019s default. Instead, Chase merely\r\nimplemented the previously disclosed term specifying the\r\nNon-Preferred rate.5\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  4 The Pricing Schedule referred to in the Agreement is not contained\r\nin the case record, nor are its contents apparent from the parties\u2019 briefs,\r\nbut neither side disputes that it specified a maximum Non-Preferred\r\nrate applicable to the Agreement.\r\n   5 We are not persuaded by McCoy\u2019s argument that, although Chase\r\n\r\ndid not change a \u201ccontract term\u201d when it raised his interest rate pursu\u00ad\r\nant to the terms of the Agreement, it changed a \u201ccredit term,\u201d thereby\r\ntriggering \u00a7226.9(c)\u2019s notice requirement.

S. ____ (2011)                   11\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   This reading still leaves the question why \u00a7226.9(c)(1)\r\nrefers to interest-rate increases resulting from delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default if such increases do not constitute a\r\n\u201cchange in terms.\u201d One reasonable explanation Chase\r\noffers is that \u00a7226.9(c)(1) refers to interest-rate increases\r\nthat were not specifically outlined in the agreement\u2019s\r\ninitial terms (unlike those in the present Agreement). For\r\nexample, credit card agreements routinely include a \u201cres\u00ad\r\nervation of rights\u201d provision giving the issuer discretion to\r\nchange the terms of the contract, often as a means of\r\nresponding to events that raise doubts about the card\u00ad\r\nholder\u2019s creditworthiness. An issuer may exercise this\r\ngeneral contract-modification authority and raise the\r\ninterest rate applicable to the account to address any\r\nheightened risk. See Brief for Petitioner 6. In such a case,\r\n\u00a7226.9(c)(1) is best read to require that notice must be\r\ngiven prior to the effective date of the increase, because\r\nthe unilateral increase instituted by the issuer actually\r\nchanged a term\u2014the interest rate\u2014in a manner not spe\u00ad\r\ncifically contemplated by the agreement.6 See Comment\r\n9(c)\u20131 (providing that notice is required if the agreement\r\n\u201cdoes not include specific terms for an increase (for exam\u00ad\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ntion Z does not refer to, let alone distinguish between, \u201ccontract terms\u201d\r\nand \u201ccredit terms,\u201d and McCoy\u2019s repeated citations to TILA\u2019s broad\r\npolicy statement do not convince us that such a distinction is war\u00ad\r\nranted. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71601(a) (\u201cIt is the purpose of this subchapter\r\nto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer\r\nwill be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available\r\nto him and avoid the uninformed use of credit\u201d).\r\n   6 The Government offers an alternative example. Assume that the\r\n\r\nagreement is similar to the one at issue here, with a specified maxi\u00ad\r\nmum level to which the interest rate can be increased if the cardholder\r\ndefaults. If default occurs but the issuer raises the rate above the\r\ncontractual maximum, notice must be given prior to the effective date\r\nbecause the issuer actually changed the term of the contract initially\r\nspecifying the maximum rate possible.

We need not decide which party\u2019s\r\ninterpretation is more persuasive, however; both are\r\nplausible, and the text alone does not permit a more de\u00ad\r\nfinitive reading. Accordingly, we find Regulation Z to be\r\nambiguous as to the question presented, and must there\u00ad\r\nfore look to the Board\u2019s own interpretation of the regula\u00ad\r\ntion for guidance in deciding this case.

S., at\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  7 We note that, in reaching its decision, the Ninth Circuit did not\r\n\r\nhave the benefit of briefing from the Board. The Ninth Circuit appar\u00ad\r\nently did not solicit the views of the Board in the proceedings below, see\r\nBrief for Petitioner 16, and the First Circuit did not solicit the Board\u2019s\r\nviews in Shaner v. Chase Bank USA, N. A., 587 F. 3d 488 (2009), until\r\nafter the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case, see Order in No.\r\n09\u20131157 (CA1, Aug. 4, 2009).\r\n  8 This is consistent with the view the Board advanced in its amicus\r\n\r\nbrief to the First Circuit, in which the Board noted that it \u201chas in\u00ad\r\nterpreted the applicable provisions of Regulation Z not to require a\r\npre-effective date change-in-terms notice for an increase in annual per\u00ad\r\ncentage rate when the contingency that will trigger a rate increase and\r\nthe specific consequences for the consumer\u2019s rate are set forth in the\r\ninitial card member agreement.\u201d App. to Brief for United States as\r\nAmicus Curiae 2a.\r\n14            CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n461\u2013462. Responding to the petitioners\u2019 objection that the\r\nagency\u2019s interpretation came in a legal brief, we held that\r\nthis fact did not, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, make\r\nit unworthy of deference.\u201d Id., at 462. We observed that\r\n\u201c[t]he Secretary\u2019s position is in no sense a \u2018post hoc ration\u00ad\r\nalizatio[n]\u2019 advanced by an agency seeking to defend past\r\nagency action against attack.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.\r\nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988)). We\r\nadded: \u201cThere is simply no reason to suspect that the\r\ninterpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and con\u00ad\r\nsidered judgment on the matter in question.\u201d Auer, 519\r\nU. S., at 462.\r\n   The brief submitted by the Board in the present case, at\r\nour invitation, is no different. As in Auer, there is no\r\nreason to believe that the interpretation advanced by the\r\nBoard is a \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d taken as a litigation\r\nposition. The Board is not a party to this case. And as is\r\nevident from our discussion of Regulation Z itself, see Part\r\nII\u2013A, supra, the Board\u2019s interpretation is neither \u201cplainly\r\nerroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the indeterminate text\r\nof the regulation. In short, there is no reason to suspect\r\nthat the position the Board takes in its amicus brief re\u00ad\r\nflects anything other than the agency\u2019s fair and considered\r\njudgment as to what the regulation required at the time\r\nthis dispute arose.\r\n   McCoy may well be correct in asserting that it is better\r\npolicy to oblige credit-card issuers to give advance notice\r\nof a rate increase; after all, both Congress and the Board\r\nhave recently indicated that such a requirement is war\u00ad\r\nranted. See Credit CARD Act, \u00a7101(a)(1), 123 Stat. 1735\u2013\r\n1736; 12 CFR \u00a7226.9(g) (2009). That Congress and the\r\nBoard may currently hold such views does not mean,\r\nhowever, that deference is not warranted to the Board\u2019s\r\ndifferent understanding of what the pre-2009 version of\r\nRegulation Z required. To the contrary, the interpretation\r\nthe Board advances in its amicus brief is entirely consis\u00ad\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntent with its past views. The 2004 notice of rulemaking\r\nand the 2007 proposed amendments to Regulation Z make\r\nclear that, prior to 2009, the Board\u2019s fair and considered\r\njudgment was that \u201cno change-in-terms notice is required\r\nif the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances\r\nunder which an increase . . . will occur,\u201d 69 Fed. Reg.\r\n70931, and \u201cimmediate application of penalty pricing upon\r\nthe occurrence of certain events specified in the contract\u201d\r\nwas permissible, 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.\r\n   Under Auer, therefore, it is clear that deference to the\r\ninterpretation in the Board\u2019s amicus brief is warranted.\r\nThe cases McCoy cites in which we declined to apply Auer\r\ndo not suggest that deference is unwarranted here. In\r\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), we declined to\r\ndefer because\u2014in sharp contrast to the present case\u2014\r\nthe regulation in question did \u201clittle more than restate the\r\nterms of the statute\u201d pursuant to which the regulation was\r\npromulgated. Id., at 257. Accordingly, no deference was\r\nwarranted to an agency interpretation of what were, in\r\nfact, Congress\u2019 words. Ibid. In contrast, at the time of the\r\ntransactions in this case, TILA itself included no require\u00ad\r\nments with respect to the disclosure of a change in credit\r\nterms. In Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576\r\n(2000), we declined to apply Auer deference because the\r\nregulation in question was unambiguous, and adopting the\r\nagency\u2019s contrary interpretation would \u201cpermit the agency,\r\nunder the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de\r\nfacto a new regulation.\u201d 529 U. S., at 588. In light of\r\nRegulation Z\u2019s ambiguity, there is no such danger here.\r\nAnd our statement in Christensen that \u201cdeference is war\u00ad\r\nranted only when the language of the regulation is am\u00ad\r\nbiguous,\u201d ibid., is perfectly consonant with Auer itself; if\r\nthe text of a regulation is unambiguous, a conflicting\r\nagency interpretation advanced in an amicus brief will\r\nnecessarily be \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\r\nregulation\u201d in question. Auer, 519 U. S., at 461 (internal\r\n16               CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, under our prece\u00ad\r\ndent deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own\r\nregulation, as presented in the agency\u2019s amicus brief, is\r\nwholly appropriate.\r\n                             C\r\n  McCoy further argues that deference to a legal brief is\r\ninappropriate because the interpretation of Regulation Z\r\nin the Official Staff Commentary commands a different\r\nresult. To be sure, the Official Staff Commentary promul\u00ad\r\ngated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z\r\nmay warrant deference as a general matter. See Anderson\r\nBros. Ford v. Valencia, 452 U. S. 205, 219 (1981) (holding\r\nthat \u201cthe Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation\u201d\r\nshould generally \u201cbe accepted by the courts\u201d); Milhollin,\r\n444 U. S., at 565 (\u201cUnless demonstrably irrational, Fed\u00ad\r\neral Reserve Board staff opinions construing [TILA] or\r\nRegulation [Z] should be dispositive\u201d). We find, however,\r\nthat the Commentary at issue here largely replicates the\r\nambiguity present in the regulatory text, and therefore it\r\noffers us nothing to which we can defer with respect to the\r\nprecise interpretive question before us.9 Cf. Smith v. City\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   9 We are not persuaded by McCoy\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s own\r\n\r\nregulations make the Official Staff Commentary \u201cthe exclusive source of\r\nauthorized staff opinion.\u201d Brief for Respondent 36 (emphasis added).\r\nIn the regulations McCoy cites the Board has indicated only that the\r\ncentral purpose of the Commentary is to present agency interpretations\r\nthat, if relied upon, provide the basis for invoking the good-faith de\u00ad\r\nfense to liability under TILA. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(f) (precluding\r\nliability for \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity . . .\r\nwith any interpretation . . . by an official or employee . . . duly author\u00ad\r\nized by the Board to issue such interpretations . . . under such proce\u00ad\r\ndures as the Board may prescribe\u201d); 12 CFR pt. 226, App. C (2008)\r\n(\u201c[O]fficial staff interpretations of this regulation . . . provide the\r\nprotection afforded under [\u00a71640(f)]\u201d); id., Supp. I, Introduction \u00b61, p.\r\n451 (same); 46 Fed.

[i]f there is an\r\nincreased periodic rate or any other finance charge attri\u00ad\r\nbutable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default.\u201d This\r\nexposition of the regulation does not add any clarity to the\r\nregulatory text, which expresses the same requirement.\r\nSee \u00a7226.9(c)(1) (2008) (\u201c[I]f a periodic rate or other fi\u00ad\r\nnance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default . . . notice shall be given . . . before the\r\neffective date of the change\u201d). And like \u00a7226.9(c), Com\u00ad\r\nment 9(c) is entitled \u201cChange in terms.\u201d Accordingly,\r\nChase\u2019s plausible interpretation of \u00a7226.9(c)(1) is equally\r\napplicable to Comment 9(c)(1)\u20133: On Chase\u2019s view, be\u00ad\r\ncause the interest-rate increase at issue in this case did\r\nnot constitute a \u201cchange in terms,\u201d the disclosure require\u00ad\r\nments in the regulation and Commentary simply do not\r\ncome into play. See supra, at 10\u201311.\r\n   Comment 9(c)\u20131 is also ambiguous, though the most\r\nplausible reading supports Chase\u2019s position more than it\r\ndoes McCoy\u2019s. The Comment begins: \u201cNo notice of a\r\nchange in terms need be given if the specific change is set\r\nforth initially\u201d in the agreement. We do not find that the\r\nComment\u2019s addition of the modifier \u201cspecific\u201d to the word\r\n\u201cchange\u201d enables us to determine, any more than we could\r\nin light of the text of the regulation, see supra, at 12,\r\nwhether the interest-rate increase at issue in this case\r\nwas a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice. According to\r\nChase, as long as the agreement explains that delinquency\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\r\nissue authoritative interpretations for other purposes. \r\n\r\n18               CHASE BANK USA, N. A. v. MCCOY\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nor default might trigger an increased interest rate and\r\nstates the maximum level to which the rate could be in\u00ad\r\ncreased, the \u201cspecific change\u201d that ensues upon default has\r\nbeen set forth initially and no additional notice is required\r\nbefore implementation. McCoy argues to the contrary:\r\nUnder Comment 9(c)\u20131, any new rate imposed after delin\u00ad\r\nquency or default must be disclosed prior to the effective\r\ndate, if the particular rate (rather than the maximum\r\nrate) was not specifically mentioned in the agreement. On\r\nthe whole, then, the Official Staff Commentary\u2019s explana\u00ad\r\ntion of Regulation Z does not resolve the uncertainty in the\r\nregulatory text, and offers us no reason to disregard\r\nthe interpretation advanced in the Board\u2019s amicus brief.10\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   10 In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit focused on the examples\r\n\r\nComment 9(c)\u20131 provides of changes that, if set forth initially, require\r\nno further disclosure when put into effect:\r\n\u201cNo notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is\r\nset forth initially, such as: Rate increases under a properly disclosed\r\nvariable-rate plan, a rate increase that occurs when an employee has\r\nbeen under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment,\r\nor an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an\r\nagreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order\r\nto keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the\r\nspecified minimum.\u201d\r\n   The Ninth Circuit concluded that, in contrast to each of these three\r\nexamples, \u201cthe increase here occurs at Chase\u2019s discretion.\u201d 559 F. 3d\r\n963, 966 (2009). That is, once the triggering event\u2014McCoy\u2019s default\u2014\r\noccurred, Chase had the latitude to increase the interest rate as it saw\r\nfit (up to the limit specified in the Pricing Schedule).\r\n   We are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Certainly,\r\nunder a \u201cvariable-rate\u201d plan the interest rate fluctuates according to an\r\nexternal variable easily discernable by the cardholder (like the Federal\r\nPrime rate), and the issuer has no discretion. See ibid. But the Com\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s second and third examples do not appear to be significantly\r\ndifferent from this case: The agreement contains a preset rate, but it\r\nalso provides that, on the occurrence of a predefined event (terminating\r\nemployment or a low account balance), the rate will increase.\r\n   Moreover, Comment 9(c)\u20131 further states that notice is needed \u201cif the\r\ncontract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but\r\ndoes not include specific terms for an increase\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cwhen an\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

We are not convinced.\r\nMcCoy may be correct that the Board established the\r\nOfficial Staff Commentary so as to centralize its opinion\u00ad\r\nmaking process and avoid \u201coverburdening the industry\r\nwith excessive detail and multiple research sources.\u201d 46\r\nFed. Reg. 50288. But his suggestion that, if we accord\r\ndeference to an amicus brief, all other \u201cunofficial\u201d sources\r\nwill be fair game is of no moment. Today we decide only\r\nthat the amicus brief submitted by the Board is entitled to\r\ndeference in light of \u201cthe circumstances of this case.\u201d\r\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 462.\r\n  Accordingly, we conclude that, at the time of the trans\u00ad\r\nactions at issue in this case, Regulation Z did not require\r\nChase to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice\r\nbefore it implemented the Agreement term allowing it to\r\nraise his interest rate following delinquency or default.\r\n                        *   *    *\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed,\r\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consis\u00ad\r\ntent with this opinion.\r\n                                          It is so ordered.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nincrease may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation right to\r\nincrease the periodic rate.\u201d It would seem that the narrower latitude\r\nChase had under the Agreement to set the precise new rate within a\r\nspecified range after McCoy defaulted is not the kind of \u201cdiscretion\u201d the\r\nlast example of Comment 9(c)\u20131 contemplates. In short, analogizing to\r\nthe Comment\u2019s examples suggests that Chase\u2019s action in setting a new\r\nrate was most likely a \u201cspecific change\u201d that the Agreement itself\r\ncontemplated, and subsequent disclosure was not clearly required.\r\n</pre>",
