ALABAMA DEPART-\n           MENT OF REVENUE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 09\u2013520.      Argued November 10, 2010\u2014Decided February 22, 2011\nPetitioner (CSX) is an interstate rail carrier that operates, and pays\n  taxes, in Alabama. The State imposes sales and use taxes on rail\n  roads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts their\n  main competitors\u2014interstate motor and water carriers. CSX sued\n  respondents, the Alabama Department of Revenue and its Commis\n  sioner (Alabama), claiming that this tax scheme discriminates\n  against railroads in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and\n  Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4\u2013R Act or Act), which bars four\n  forms of discriminatory taxation, 49 U. S. C. \u00a711501(b). Three of the\n  delineated prohibitions deal with property taxes, \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3),\n  and the fourth is a catch-all provision that forbids a State to\n  \u201c[i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,\u201d\n  \u00a711501(b)(4). The District Court dismissed CSX\u2019s suit as not cogni\n  zable under the 4\u2013R Act on the basis of this Court\u2019s decision in De\n  partment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,\n  and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: CSX may challenge Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes under\n \u00a711501(b)(4). Pp. 5\u201319.\n    (a) CSX is challenging \u201canother tax\u201d within subsection (b)(4)\u2019s plain\n meaning. The Act does not define \u201ctax.\u201d Thus, this Court looks to the\n word\u2019s ordinary definition, which is expansive. A State seeking to\n raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxation on prop\n erty, income, transactions, or activities. \u201c[A]nother tax\u201d is thus best\n understood to encompass any tax a State might impose, on any asset\n or transaction, except the property taxes already addressed in sub\n sections (b)(1)\u2013(3). There is no reason to interpret subsection (b)(4)\n as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes that some States imposed\n2        CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                         REVENUE                                           \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    in lieu of property taxes at the time of the Act\u2019s passage. Moreover,\n    CSX\u2019s complaint, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent view,\n    does protest Alabama\u2019s imposition of taxes on its fuel. The exemp\n    tions the State has given may play a central role in CSX\u2019s argument,\n    but the complaint\u2019s essential subject remains the taxes imposed.\n       The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be said to \u201cdis\n    criminate\u201d against a railroad under subsection (b)(4) where the State\n    has granted exemptions from the tax to other entities (here, the rail\n    road\u2019s competitors). Because the statute does not define \u201cdiscrimi\n    nates,\u201d the Court again looks to the term\u2019s ordinary meaning, which\n    is to fail to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction\n    can be found between those favored and those not favored. To charge\n    one group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4% rate, if the\n    groups are the same in all relevant respects, is to discriminate\n    against the latter. That discrimination continues if the favored\n    group\u2019s rate goes down to 0%, which is all an exemption is. To say\n    that such a tax does not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d is to adopt a definition at odds\n    with the word\u2019s natural meaning. This Court has repeatedly recog\n    nized that tax schemes with exemptions may be discriminatory. See,\n    e.g., Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803. And\n    even Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n    332, on which the Eleventh Circuit heavily relied in dismissing CSX\u2019s\n    suit, made clear that tax exemptions \u201ccould be a variant of tax dis\n    crimination.\u201d Id., at 343. In addition, the statute\u2019s prohibition of dis\n    crimination applies regardless whether the favored entities are inter\n    state or local. The distinctions drawn in the statute are not between\n    interstate and local actors, as Alabama suggests, but between rail\n    roads and all other actors, whether interstate or local. Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) ACF Industries does not require a different result. There, the\n    Court held that railroads could not contest property tax exemptions\n    under subsection (b)(4), reasoning that it would be illogical to permit\n    such a challenge when subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014the \u00a711501 provisions\n    specifically addressing property taxes\u2014permitted States to grant\n    property tax exemptions. Such a reading would \u201csubvert the statu\n    tory plan\u201d and \u201ccontravene the \u2018elementary canon of construction that\n    a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inopera\n    tive.\u2019 \u201d 510 U. S., at 340. Contrary to Alabama\u2019s argument, this\n    structural analysis does not apply here. Subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) spe\n    cifically allow property tax exemptions, but neither they nor any\n    other provision of the Act speaks to non-property exemptions like\n    those at issue here. Because Congress has expressed no intent to\n    \u201callo[w] the States to grant\u201d non-property exemptions, id., at 343,\n    reading subsection (b)(4) to encompass them poses no danger of \u201cnul\n    lify[ing]\u201d a congressional policy choice or otherwise \u201csubverting the\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

Alabama\u2019s other efforts to borrow\n  from ACF Industries\u2019 analysis similarly fail. Also unavailing is Ala\n  bama\u2019s argument that, even if ACF Industries\u2019 reasoning is limited to\n  property tax exemptions, its holding must extend to non-property tax\n  exemptions in order to prevent inconsistent or anomalous results in\n  the treatment of property and non-property taxes.

We consider\nhere whether a railroad may invoke this statute to chal\u00ad\nlenge sales and use taxes that apply to rail carriers\n(among others), but exempt their competitors in the\ntransportation industry. We conclude that the railroad\nmay do so.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization and Regu\u00ad\nlatory Reform Act of 1976 (Act or 4\u2013R Act) to \u201crestore the\nfinancial stability of the railway system of the United\nStates,\u201d among other purposes. \u00a7101(a), 90 Stat. 33.

(CSX) is an inter\u00ad\nstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama and pays taxes\nthere. Alabama imposes a sales tax of 4% on the gross\nreceipts of retail businesses, Ala. Code \u00a740\u201323\u20132(1) (2010\nCum. Supp.), and a use tax of 4% on the storage, use, or\nconsumption of tangible personal property, \u00a740\u201323\u201361(a)\n(2003). Railroads pay these taxes when they purchase or\nconsume diesel fuel. But railroads\u2019 main competitors\u2014\ninterstate motor and water carriers\u2014are generally exempt\nfrom paying sales and use taxes on their fuel (although\nfuel for motor carriers is subject to a separate excise tax).3\n  Alleging that Alabama\u2019s tax scheme discriminates\nagainst railroads in violation of \u00a711501(b)(4) of the 4\u2013R\nAct, CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of\nRevenue and its Commissioner (Alabama or State), in\nFederal District Court. In particular, CSX complained\nthat the State could not impose sales and use taxes on\nrailroads\u2019 purchase and consumption of diesel fuel while\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The first sentence of subsection (c) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding sec\u00ad\n\ntion 1341 of title 28 . . . a district court of the United States has\njurisdiction . . . to prevent a violation of subsection (b) of this section.\u201d\nThe next sentence concerns the relief available for violations of\n\u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1) and (2): \u201cRelief may be granted under this subsection\nonly if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transpor\u00ad\ntation property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value\nto true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the\nsame assessment jurisdiction.\u201d\n   3 State law provides that motor carriers need not pay sales or use\n\ntaxes on diesel fuel so long as they pay a different excise tax of $0.19\nper gallon. Ala. Code \u00a740\u201317\u20132(1) (2003) (primary tax of $0.13 per\ngallon); \u00a740\u201317\u2013220(e) (2010 Cum. Supp.) (additional tax of $0.06 per\ngallon). State law wholly exempts interstate water carriers from sales\nand use taxes on diesel fuel. \u00a740\u201323\u20134(a)(10); \u00a740\u201323\u201362(12).

Appx. 318 (2009). The Elev\u00ad\nenth Circuit rested on its earlier decision in Norfolk\nSouthern R. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550 F. 3d\n1306 (2008), which involved a nearly identical challenge to\nthe application of Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes.\n   In Norfolk Southern, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the\nplaintiff railroad\u2019s challenge, principally in reliance on this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF\nIndustries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332 (1994). In that case, we\nheld that a railroad could not invoke \u00a711501(b)(4) to chal\u00ad\nlenge a generally applicable property tax on the basis that\ncertain non-railroad property was exempt from the tax.\nId., at 335. The Eleventh Circuit recognized that the case\nbefore it involved sales and use taxes\u2014not property taxes,\nwhich the statutory scheme separately addresses. Norfolk\nSouthern, 550 F. 3d, at 1314. The court concluded, how\u00ad\never, that this difference was immaterial, and accordingly\nheld that a railroad could not object to Alabama\u2019s sales\nand use taxes simply because the State provides exemp\u00ad\ntions from them. Id., at 1316.\n   CSX petitioned for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the\nEleventh Circuit had misunderstood ACF Industries and\nnoting a split of authority concerning whether railroads\nmay bring a challenge under \u00a711501(b)(4) to non-property\ntaxes from which their competitors are exempt.4 We\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Compare Norfolk Southern R.

To\ndetermine whether this suit may go forward, we must\ntherefore answer two questions. Is CSX challenging \u201can\u00ad\nother tax\u201d within the meaning of the statute? And, if so,\nmight that tax \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against rail carriers by\nexempting their competitors?5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nton No. R. Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 606 N.

W.\n2d 338, 348 (Iowa 1983) (same).\n   5 We consider here only questions relating to whether CSX can bring\n\na claim for discrimination based on the State\u2019s pattern of tax exemp\u00ad\ntions. We do not consider any issues concerning whether these exemp\u00ad\ntions actually discriminate against CSX. See infra, at 18\u201319, and n. 8.\nAlabama has raised two such issues in this Court. First, Alabama\ncontends that in deciding CSX\u2019s claim, a federal court must consider\nnot only the specific taxes challenged, but also the broader tax scheme.\nBrief for Respondents 58\u201360. Second, the State argues that the court\nmust compare the taxation of CSX not merely to direct competitors\nbut to other commercial entities as well. Id., at 48, n. 7. Most of the\ndissenting opinion is devoted to supporting the State\u2019s argument on\nthis second question. But we leave these and all other issues relating\nto whether Alabama actually has discriminated against CSX to the\ntrial court on remand to address as and when it wishes. No court in\nthis case has previously considered these questions, and the parties\u2019\nbriefs in this Court have only sketchily addressed them. In addition,\nthe parties dispute whether Alabama waived its claim on the second\nissue by initially agreeing that \u201cthe comparison class consists of motor\ncarriers and water carriers,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), and proceeding with the litigation on that basis.\n6      CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

In these circumstances, we look to the word\u2019s\nordinary definition, Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513\nU. S. 179, 187 (1995), and we note what taxpayers have\nlong since discovered\u2014that the meaning of \u201ctax\u201d is expan\u00ad\nsive. A State (or other governmental entity) seeking to\nraise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxa\u00ad\ntion on property, income, transactions, or activities.\n\u201c[A]nother tax,\u201d as used in subsection (b)(4), is best under\u00ad\nstood to refer to all of these\u2014more precisely, to encompass\nany form of tax a State might impose, on any asset or\ntransaction, except the taxes on property previously ad\u00ad\ndressed in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3). See Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Superior, 932 F. 2d 1185, 1186 (CA7 1991) (Sub\u00ad\nsection (b)(4) includes \u201can income tax, a gross-receipts tax,\na use tax, an occupation tax . . . \u2014whatever\u201d). The phrase\n\u201canother tax\u201d is a catch-all.\n   In particular, we see no reason to interpret subsection\n(b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes\u2014known\nas \u201cin lieu\u201d taxes\u2014that some States imposed instead of\nproperty taxes at the time of the Act\u2019s passage. See Brief\nfor Respondents 53\u201355; Brief for State of Washington\net al. as Amici Curiae 20\u201322. The argument in favor of\nthis construction relies on the House Report concerning\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWe think this question of waiver is also best considered by the trial\ncourt.\n  6 As originally enacted, the provision that is now 49 U. S. C.\n\n\u00a711501(b)(4) prohibited the imposition of \u201cany other tax\u201d that discrimi\u00ad\nnates against a railroad. \u00a726c (1976 ed.). The substitution of \u201canother\ntax\u201d occurred when Congress first recodified the Act. In line with\nCongress\u2019s statement that revisions made at that time should not be\nconstrued as having substantive effect, see n. 1, supra, we treat the two\nterms as synonymous.\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe bill, which described subsection (b)(4) as prohibiting\n\u201cthe imposition of . . . the so-called \u2018in lieu tax.\u2019 \u201d H. R.\nRep. No. 94\u2013725, p. 77 (1975). But the Conference Report\non the final bill abandoned the House Report\u2019s narrowing\nlanguage and described the subsection as it was written\u2014\nas prohibiting, without limitation, \u201cthe imposition of any\nother tax which results in the discriminatory treatment of\nany\u201d railroad. S. Conf. Rep. No. 94\u2013595, pp. 165\u2013166\n(1976); accord, S. Rep. No. 94\u2013499, p. 65 (1975). And the\nstatutory language is the real crux of the matter: Subsec\u00ad\ntion (b)(4) speaks both clearly and broadly, and a legisla\u00ad\ntive report misdescribing the provision cannot succeed in\naltering it.7\n   Nor do we agree with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent\nview that CSX does not challenge \u201canother tax\u201d because its\ncomplaint relies on the exemptions the State has given.\nSee Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1315 (\u201cThe language of\nsection (b)(4) prohibits a discriminatory \u2018tax\u2019 not a dis\u00ad\ncriminatory tax exemption\u201d); Brief for American Trucking\nAssns., Inc. as Amicus Curiae 9. What the complaint\nprotests is Alabama\u2019s imposition of taxes on the fuel CSX\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Alabama also invokes the remedial provision of subsection (c), n. 2,\n\nsupra, to urge that we read \u00a711501 as effectively limited to property or\n\u201cin lieu\u201d taxes. According to Alabama, that provision entitles federal\ncourts to grant relief only when States overvalue railroad property\nunder subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2): Federal courts, the State avers,\n\u201chave no power to enjoin the granting of tax exemptions as a violation\nof subsection (b)(4), or, apparently [to remedy] any violation of sub-\nsection (b)(4).\u201d Brief for Respondents 37. But that interpretation of\nsubsection (c)\u2019s remedial provision cannot be right, because it would\nnullify subsection (b)(4) (and, for that matter, subsection (b)(3) as well).\nWe understand subsection (c)\u2019s remedial provision neither as limiting\nthe broad grant of jurisdiction to federal courts to prevent violations of\nsubsection (b) nor as otherwise restricting the scope of that subsection.\nThe remedial provision simply limits the availability of relief when a\nState discriminates in assessing the value of railroad property, as\nproscribed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). That kind of discrimination\nis not at issue here.\n8     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nuses; what the complaint requests is that Alabama cease\nto collect those taxes from CSX. App. 23. The exemptions,\nno doubt, play a central role in CSX\u2019s argument: They\ndemonstrate, in CSX\u2019s view, that the State\u2019s sales and use\ntaxes discriminate against railroads. See id., at 22, \u00b6\u00b624\u2013\n26. But the essential subject of the complaint remains the\ntaxes Alabama levies on CSX.\n   The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be\nsaid to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against a railroad under subsection\n(b)(4) because the State has granted exemptions from the\ntax to other entities (here, the railroad\u2019s competitors). The\nstatute does not define \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d and so we again\nlook to the ordinary meaning of the word. See supra, at 5.\n\u201cDiscrimination\u201d is the \u201cfailure to treat all persons equally\nwhen no reasonable distinction can be found between\nthose favored and those not favored.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic\u00ad\ntionary 534 (9th ed. 2009); accord, id., at 420 (5th ed.\n1979); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\u00ad\ntionary 648 (1976) (\u201cdiscriminates\u201d means \u201cto make a\ndifference in treatment or favor on a class or categorical\nbasis in disregard of individual merit\u201d). To charge one\ngroup of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4%\nrate, if the groups are the same in all relevant respects,\nis to discriminate against the latter. That discrimination\ncontinues (indeed, it increases) if the State takes the\nfavored group\u2019s rate down to 0%. And that is all an ex\u00ad\nemption is. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512\nU. S. 186, 210\u2013211 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment) (noting that an \u201c \u2018exemption\u2019 from . . . a \u2018neutral\u2019 tax\u201d\nfor favored persons \u201cis no different in principle\u201d than \u201ca\ndiscriminatory tax . . . imposing a higher liability\u201d on\ndisfavored persons). To say that such a tax (with such an\nexemption) does not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d\u2014assuming the groups\nare similarly situated and there is no justification for the\ndifference in treatment\u2014is to adopt a definition of the\nterm at odds with its natural meaning.\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  In line with this understanding, our decisions have\nrepeatedly recognized that tax schemes with exemptions\nmay be discriminatory. In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), for example, we reviewed a\nstate income tax provision that exempted retirement\nbenefits given by the State, but not those paid by the\nFederal Government. We held that the tax \u201cdiscrimi\u00ad\nnate[d]\u201d against federal employees under 4 U. S. C. \u00a7111,\nwhich serves to protect those employees from discrimina\u00ad\ntory state taxation. Similarly, our dormant Commerce\nClause cases have often held that tax exemptions given to\nlocal businesses discriminate against interstate actors.\nSee, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,\n268\u2013269 (1984) (holding that a state excise tax on alcohol\n\u201cdiscriminate[d]\u201d against interstate businesses because of\nexemptions granted to local producers); Camps New\u00ad\nfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564,\n588\u2013589 (1997) (invalidating as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d a state\nproperty tax that exempted organizations operating for\nthe benefit of residents, but not organizations aimed at\nnonresidents). And even our decision in ACF Industries,\non which the Eleventh Circuit relied in dismissing CSX\u2019s\nsuit, made clear that tax exemptions \u201ccould be a variant of\ntax discrimination.\u201d 510 U. S., at 343.\n  Nor does the 4\u2013R Act limit the prohibited discrimination\nto state tax schemes that unjustifiably exempt local actors,\nas opposed to interstate entities. Alabama argues for this\nresult, claiming that \u00a711501(b) is designed \u201cto protect\ninterstate carriers against discrimination vis-\u00e0-vis local\nbusinesses.\u201d Brief for Respondents 29. But the text of\n\u00a711501(b) tells a different story. Consistent with the Act\u2019s\npurpose of restoring the financial stability of railroads (not\nof interstate carriers generally), supra, at 1, each of sub\u00ad\nsection (b)\u2019s provisions proscribes taxes that specially\nburden a rail carrier\u2019s property or otherwise discriminate\nagainst a rail carrier. And not a single provision of the\n10     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                        REVENUE                                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nAct (including the references in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) to\n\u201ccommercial and industrial property\u201d) distinguishes be\u00ad\ntween local and non-local taxpayers who receive favorable\ntax treatment. The distinctions drawn in \u00a711501(b) are\nnot between interstate and local actors, as the State con\u00ad\ntends, but rather between railroads and other actors,\nwhether interstate or local. Accordingly, a state excise tax\nthat applies to railroads but exempts their interstate\ncompetitors is subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4)\nas a \u201ctax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\u201d8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 This conclusion does not, as Alabama and the dissent contend, turn\n\nrailroads into \u201cmost-favored-taxpayers,\u201d entitled to any exemption (or\nother tax break) that a State gives to another entity. See Brief for\nRespondents 23; post, at 9 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). We hold only that\n\u00a711501(b)(4) enables a railroad to challenge an excise or other non\u00ad\nproperty tax as discriminatory on the basis of the tax scheme\u2019s exemp\u00ad\ntions\u2014as the dissent apparently agrees, post, at 1. Whether the\nrailroad will prevail\u2014that is, whether it can prove the alleged dis\u00ad\ncrimination\u2014depends on whether the State offers a sufficient justifica\u00ad\ntion for declining to provide the exemption at issue to rail carriers. See\nsupra, at 8; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25\u201326; Richmond,\nF. & P. R. Co. v. Department of Taxation, Commonwealth of Va., 762\nF. 2d 375, 380\u2013381, and n. 4 (CA4 1985). So if, to use the dissent\u2019s\nexample, a railroad challenged a scheme in which \u201cevery person and\nbusiness in the State of Alabama paid a $1 annual tax, and one person\nwas exempt,\u201d post, at 9, for some reason having nothing to do with\nrailroads, we presume the suit would be promptly dismissed. Nothing\nin this application of \u00a711501(b)(4) offers a \u201cwindfall\u201d to railroads. Ibid.\n   The dissent argues in addition that a State should prevail against\nany claim of discrimination brought under subsection (b)(4) if it can\ndemonstrate that a tax does not \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201csingle out\u201d a railroad, post,\nat 1; that showing, without more, would justify the tax (although the\ndissent declines to say just what it means to \u201ctarget,\u201d post, at 7, n. 3).\nThis argument primarily concerns the question whether Alabama\u2019s tax\nscheme in fact discriminates under subsection (b)(4)\u2014a question we\nhave explained is inappropriate to address, see n. 5, supra. We note,\nhowever, that the dissent\u2019s argument about subsection (b)(4) rests\nentirely on the premise that subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) prohibit only prop\u00ad\nerty taxes that \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201csingle out\u201d railroads, see post, at 4; so, the\ndissent would say, a State may impose a 4% property tax on railroads\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n   As against the plain language of subsection (b)(4), Ala\u00ad\nbama offers two arguments based on our decision in ACF\nIndustries. The first claim, which the Eleventh Circuit\naccepted, rests on the reasoning we adopted in ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries: We concluded there that railroads could not chal\u00ad\nlenge property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4),\nand Alabama asserts that the same analysis applies to ex-\ncise (and other non-property) tax exemptions. The second\ncontention focuses on alleged problems that would emerge\nin the application of \u00a711501(b) if the rule of ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries did not govern all tax exemptions. On this view, even\nif ACF Industries\u2019 reasoning is irrelevant to cases involv\u00ad\ning excise taxes, its holding must extend to those cases to\nprevent inconsistent or anomalous results. We reject each\nof these arguments. We stand foursquare behind our\ndecision in ACF Industries, but we will not extend it in the\nway the State wishes.\n                              A\n  In ACF Industries, we considered whether a railroad\ncould sue a State under subsection (b)(4) for taxing rail\u00ad\nroad property while exempting certain other commercial\nproperty. We held that the railroad could not do so. We\nnoted that the language of subsection (b)(4), when viewed\nin isolation, could be read to allow such a challenge. But\nwe reasoned that the structure of \u00a711501 required the\nopposite result. 510 U. S., at 343. The Eleventh Circuit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(assuming some unspecified number of other taxpayers also pay that\nrate) while levying only a 2% property tax on railroad competitors. But\nwe have never decided, in ACF Industries or any other case, whether\nsubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) should be interpreted in this manner. And even\naccepting the dissent\u2019s unexplained premise, a serious question would\nremain about whether to transplant this construction of subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) to subsection (b)(4)\u2019s very different terrain, see infra, at 16\u2013\n18.\n12    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                               \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsidered ACF Industries \u201cdeterminative\u201d of the question\nhere, Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1313, and Alabama\nagrees, Brief for Respondents 18. We think they misread\nthat decision.\n  We began our analysis in ACF Industries by explaining\nthat railroads could not challenge property tax exemptions\nunder subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014the provisions of \u00a711501\nspecifically addressing property taxes. As noted earlier,\nsubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) prohibit a State from imposing\nhigher property tax rates or assessment ratios on \u201crail\ntransportation property\u201d than on \u201cother commercial and\nindustrial property.\u201d The statute defines \u201ccommercial and\nindustrial property\u201d as including only \u201cproperty . . . subject\nto a property tax levy.\u201d \u00a711501(a)(4). We interpreted that\nphrase to mean \u201cproperty that is taxed,\u201d rather than\nproperty that is potentially taxable. 510 U. S., at 341\u2013342.\nAs a result, we determined that exempt (i.e., non-taxed)\nproperty fell outside the category of \u201cother commercial and\nindustrial property\u201d against which the taxation of railroad\nproperty is measured. Ibid. The conclusion followed:\nSubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) permitted States to impose property\ntaxes on railroads while exempting other entities. Ibid.\n  And because that was so, we stated, still another con\u00ad\nclusion followed: Subsection (b)(4)\u2019s prohibition on dis\u00ad\ncrimination likewise could not encompass property tax\nexemptions. Id., at 343. We viewed this holding as a\nmatter of simple deduction: \u201cIt would be illogical to con\u00ad\nclude that Congress, having allowed the States to grant\nproperty tax exemptions in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3), would\nturn around and nullify its own choice in subsection\n(b)(4).\u201d Ibid. Or stated otherwise: \u201c[R]eading subsection\n(b)(4) to prohibit what\u201d other parts of the statute were\n\u201cdesigned to allow,\u201d would \u201csubvert the statutory plan\u201d\nand \u201ccontravene the \u2018elementary canon of construction\nthat a statute should be interpreted so as not to render\none part inoperative.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 340. The structure of\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) specifically address\u2014and allow\u2014property tax\nexemptions. But neither those subsections nor any other\nprovision of the 4\u2013R Act speaks to non-property tax ex\u00ad\nemptions like those at issue in this case. Congress has\nexpressed no intent to \u201callo[w] the States to grant\u201d these\nexemptions. Ibid. Reading subsection (b)(4) as written\u2014\nto encompass non-property tax exemptions\u2014therefore\nposes no danger of \u201cnullify[ing]\u201d a congressional policy\nchoice or otherwise \u201csubvert[ing] the statutory plan.\u201d Id.,\nat 340, 343. To the contrary: Giving subsection (b)(4)\nsomething other than its ordinary meaning, absent any\nstructural reason to do so, would itself contravene the\nexpressed will of Congress.\n   Implicitly acknowledging that ACF Industries\u2019 central\ntheory is irrelevant here, Alabama focuses on what that\ndecision called \u201c[o]ther considerations reinforc[ing]\u201d its\nstructural analysis. Id., at 343. Most notably, Alabama\nunderscores the following sentence from ACF Industries:\n\u201cGiven the prevalence of property tax exemptions when\nCongress enacted the 4\u2013R Act, [\u00a711501\u2019s] silence on the\nsubject\u2014in light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and\nassessment ratio discrimination\u2014reflects a determination\nto permit the States to leave their exemptions in place.\u201d\nId., at 344. Alabama asserts that this statement \u201cholds\njust as true\u201d for sales and use taxes. Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 41.\n   That claim rings hollow. To be sure, ACF Industries\nnoted that Congress had declined to speak \u201cwith any\ndegree of particularity to\u201d the permissibility of property\ntax exemptions, even though States often granted them.\n510 U. S., at 343. But we thought that fact relevant only\n14    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause Congress had spoken with particularity in pro\u00ad\nscribing other forms of discriminatory property taxes. The\nvery sentence Alabama highlights makes our reasoning\nclear: Congress\u2019s silence as to the practice of granting\nproperty tax exemptions reflected its acquiescence in that\npractice \u201cin light of the explicit prohibition [in subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3)] of [property] tax rate and assessment ratio\ndiscrimination.\u201d Id., at 344 (emphasis added). If that\nexplicit prohibition had not existed\u2014if \u00a711501(b) had\nconsisted only of subsection (b)(4)\u2019s broad ban on tax\ndiscrimination\u2014we could not have gleaned what we did\nfrom congressional silence. After all, the very purpose of a\ncatch-all provision like subsection (b)(4) is to avoid the\nnecessity of listing each matter (here, each kind of tax\ndiscrimination) falling within it. And with respect to non\u00ad\nproperty taxes (like Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes), sub\u00ad\nsection (b)(4) is all there is. So here again, our analysis in\nACF Industries does not apply because it rested on subsec\u00ad\ntions (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014that is, on the highly reticulated scheme\nin the 4\u2013R Act relating solely to property taxes.\n   Alabama also emphasizes our statement in ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries that \u201c \u2018[p]rinciples of federalism\u2019 \u201d supported our hold\u00ad\ning, Brief for Respondents 41\u201343 (quoting 510 U. S., at\n345), but this final effort to borrow from that decision\u2019s\nanalysis similarly fails. We indeed recognized in ACF\nIndustries that the 4\u2013R Act limits the traditional taxing\npower of the States. Because that is so, we expressed\n\u201chesitan[ce] to extend the statute beyond its evident\nscope.\u201d 510 U. S., at 345. But here, for all the reasons\nalready noted, we are not \u201cextend[ing] the statute\u201d; we are\nmerely giving effect to its clear meaning. To reiterate: The\n4\u2013R Act distinguishes between property taxes and other\ntaxes. Congress expressed its intent to insulate property\ntax exemptions from challenge; against that background,\nACF Industries stated that permitting such suits would\nintrude on the States\u2019 rightful authority.

Given that decision, Alabama con\u00ad\ntends, a ruling in CSX\u2019s favor here would create troubling\ninconsistencies. Alabama claims that subsection (b)(4)\u2019s\nsingular prohibition on \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d would then\nmean one thing for property taxes (according to ACF\nIndustries) and another for non-property taxes, even\nthough nothing in the statute supports \u201cmorphing defini\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Brief for Respondents 32. And still worse than the\ndifference in meaning would be the difference in result:\nA ruling for CSX, Alabama argues, would give railroads\nmore protection against non-property taxes than against\nproperty taxes, even though no good reason exists for this\ndistinction.\n   Alabama\u2019s one-word-two-meanings argument collapses\nbecause it again rests on a misunderstanding of ACF\nIndustries. That decision did not define \u201cdiscriminat[e]\u201d or\nsay that a tax exemption could not fall within that term.\nQuite to the contrary: As noted earlier, ACF Industries\nfrankly acknowledged that tax exemptions, including\nproperty tax exemptions, \u201ccould be a variant of tax dis\u00ad\ncrimination.\u201d 510 U.

That reasoning, once\nmore, does not apply here, because subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\ndo not permit\u2014indeed, in no way address\u2014non-property\ntax exemptions. We therefore do not adopt a new defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201cdiscriminate\u201d in this case; in the context of the 4\u2013R\nAct, that word has, and has always had, just one meaning.\n   What remains is Alabama\u2019s complaint that a ruling in\nCSX\u2019s favor, when combined with our decision in ACF\nIndustries, will result in divergent treatment of property\nand non-property taxes. At times, Alabama dresses up\nthis objection in Latin: It contends that the canon of ejus\u00ad\ndem generis, which \u201climits general terms [that] follow\nspecific ones to matters similar to those specified,\u201d Gooch\nv. United States, 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936), has a role to\nplay in interpreting \u00a711501(b). More particularly, Ala\u00ad\nbama contends that this canon supports reading into\n\u00a711501(b)(4) every limitation contained in \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013\n(3), including the exclusion of tax exemptions from the\nclass of state actions subject to challenge. See Brief for\nRespondents 26\u201327. That interpretive move, Alabama\nrightly notes, would ensure equal treatment of property\ntax and non-property tax exemptions.\n   But we think ejusdem generis is not relevant here. As\nan initial matter, subsection (b)(4), \u201c[a]lthough something\nof a catchall, . . . is not a general or collective term follow\u00ad\ning a list of specific items to which a particular statutory\ncommand is applicable (e.g., \u2018fishing rods, nets, hooks,\nbobbers, sinkers, and other equipment\u2019).\u201d United States v.\nAguilar, 515 U.

Related to this structural point is a functional one.\nWe typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general\nword will not render specific words meaningless. E.g.,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 114\u2013115\n(2001); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and\nStatutory Construction \u00a747:17 (7th ed. 2007). But that\nconcern is absent here. Reading subsection (b)(4) to cover\nnon-property tax exemptions will not deprive subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) of effect, because those subsections are ad\u00ad\ndressed only to property taxes. A canon meaning literally\n\u201cof the same kind\u201d has no application to provisions di\u00ad\nrected toward dissimilar subject matter.\n   The better version of Alabama\u2019s claim reads entirely in\nEnglish; it is simply that distinguishing between property\ntax exemptions and other tax exemptions makes not a\nwhit of sense. We are not much inclined to disagree.\nNeither CSX nor the United States as amicus curiae has\noffered a satisfying reason for why Congress drew this\nline\u2014why in \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3) it barred challenges based\non property tax exemptions, but then turned around in\n\u00a711501(b)(4) to allow challenges based on, say, excise tax\nexemptions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20135, 24\u201325. CSX, for\nexample, has not presented any evidence that different tax\nexemptions posed different levels of threat to railroads\u2019\nfinancial stability. So even if Congress had a good reason\nfor distinguishing between property and non-property tax\nexemptions, we acknowledge that it eludes us.\n   But this admission does not take us far in Alabama\u2019s\ndirection. Even if the 4\u2013R Act were ambiguous, we doubt\nwe would interpret subsection (b)(4) to replicate each facet\nof subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3). Treating property tax exemp\u00ad\ntions and other tax exemptions equivalently might make\nsense, as Alabama argues. But so too might allowing\nrailroads to challenge all taxes (property or non-property)\nthat contain exemptions. After all, as we noted earlier,\ntax exemptions are an obvious form of tax discrimination.\nSee supra, at 8\u20139. It is hardly self-evident why Congress\nwould prohibit a State from charging a railroad a 4% tax\nand a competitor a 2% tax, but allow the State to charge\n18    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

The\nlatter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act\neven more than the former. In ACF Industries, we ac\u00ad\ncepted that anomaly because the terms and structure of\nthe Act demanded that we do so. But we could say no\nmore in favor of the result than that it was \u201cnot so bizarre\nthat Congress could not have intended it.\u201d 510 U. S., at\n347 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was not a\nglowing recommendation, and we see no reason today to\nview the matter differently. Accordingly, even assuming\nthat statutory ambiguity permitted us to do so, we would\nhesitate to extend the distinction between tax exemptions\nand differential tax rates in order to avoid a distinction\nbetween property and non-property taxes. That would\nseem a poor trade of statutory anomalies.\n   In any event, and more importantly, the choice is not\nours to make. Congress wrote the statute it wrote, and\nthat statute draws a sharp line between property taxes\nand other taxes. Congress drafted \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3) to\nexclude tax exemptions from the sphere of prohibited\nproperty tax discrimination. But it drafted \u00a711501(b)(4)\nmore broadly, without any of the prior subsections\u2019 limita\u00ad\ntions, to proscribe other \u201ctax[es] that discriminat[e],\u201d\nincluding through the use of exemptions. That congres\u00ad\nsional election settles this case. Alabama\u2019s preference for\nsymmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute. And its\npreference for the greatest possible latitude to levy taxes\ncannot trump Congress\u2019s decision to restrict discrimina\u00ad\ntory taxation of rail carriers.\n                            IV\n  Our decision in this case is limited.

We cannot deny that assertion, but\nneither can we respond to it by precluding CSX\u2019s claim.\nDiscrimination cases sometimes do raise knotty questions\nabout whether and when dissimilar treatment is ade\u00ad\nquately justified. In the context of the 4\u2013R Act, those hard\ncalls can arise when States charge different tax rates to\ndifferent entities in a practice the statute specifically\nsubjects to challenge. See \u00a711501(b)(3). So too, difficult\nissues can emerge when, as here, States provide certain\nentities with tax exemptions.

Subsec\ntions (b)(1) through (3) instruct that States may not assess\nrailroad property at \u201ca higher ratio to the true market\nvalue . . . than . . . other commercial and industrial prop\nerty,\u201d 49 U.

Subsection (b)(4) then\nforbids \u201c[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates\nagainst a rail carrier.\u201d\n   I would look to subsections (b)(1) through (3) to deter\nmine the meaning of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d in (b)(4).

First, the \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d\naddressed in subsections (b)(1) through (3) can only be\ndescribed as taxes that target or single out railroad prop\nerty. Those subsections specifically concern taxes that\naffect railroad property differently from the way they\naffect a larger class of comparative taxpayers\u2019 property.\nSee \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3); cf. ante, at 9 (\u201c[E]ach of subsection\n(b)\u2019s provisions proscribes taxes that specially burden a\nrail carrier\u2019s property or otherwise discriminate against a\nrail carrier\u201d (emphasis deleted)).

Thus, when the majority says that \u201ca\nstate excise tax that applies to railroads but exempts their\ninterstate competitors is subject to challenge under sub\nsection (b)(4),\u201d ante, at 10, it must mean only that a tax\nexemption scheme could potentially violate subsection\n(b)(4).\n  As I understand it, the majority does not decide whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Although the majority rightly observes that whether a given tax is\n\ndiscriminatory may often be a difficult question, see ante, at 19, this is\nnot a close case. I therefore need not define the exact boundaries of\nwhat constitutes targeting or singling out. See, e.g., Norfolk Southern\nR. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550 F. 3d 1306, 1316, n. 16 (CA11\n2008) (listing examples of courts finding railroads targeted by various\nstate tax schemes).\n  3 The majority declines to reach the comparison class issue. But the\n\nquestion presented was: \u201cWhether a State\u2019s exemptions of rail carrier\ncompetitors, but not rail carriers, from generally applicable sales and\nuse taxes on fuel subject the taxes to challenge under 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a711501(b)(4) as \u2018another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\u2019 \u201d\nThe question presented thus asks whether CSX can challenge a \u201cgener\nally applicable\u201d tax based on exemptions granted to rail competitors\u2014a\nstraightforward comparison class issue. The lower courts have split\nover the proper scope of the comparison class, and the issue was pre\nsented in this case. I would decide it.\n8      CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT.

Accordingly, States remain\nfree to argue\u2014and lower courts to hold\u2014that complaints\nlike CSX\u2019s should be dismissed for failing to state a \u201cdis\ncriminat[ion]\u201d claim under \u00a711501(b)(4) when they do not\nallege that railroads are targeted or singled out compared\nto commercial and industrial taxpayers generally.\n   Nonetheless, despite the majority\u2019s assertion that it is\n\u201cinappropriate\u201d to address whether Alabama\u2019s tax scheme\nactually discriminates within the meaning of \u00a711501(b)(4),\nante, at 10, n. 8, parts of its opinion suggest an answer to\nthat question that I believe is incorrect. Relying on the\nsecond definition in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, the majority\ndefines \u201cdiscriminates\u201d as \u201c \u2018failure to treat all persons\nequally when no reasonable distinction can be found be\ntween those favored and those not favored.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8.\nThis definition of \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d combined with the major\nity\u2019s insistence that the \u201cdistinctions drawn in \u00a711501(b)\nare . . . between railroads and other actors, whether inter\nstate or local,\u201d suggests that the comparison class could be\nanyone.4 Ante, at 10. The majority ultimately implies that\n\u201canother tax that discriminates against a rail carrier\u201d is\nany tax that draws a distinction between a rail carrier and\nanyone else without sufficient justification. See ante, at\n10, n. 8 (\u201cWhether the railroad will prevail . . . depends on\nwhether the State offers a sufficient justification for de\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 A comparison class of \u201canyone\u201d is broader than either of the sides in\n\nthe lower courts\u2019 split on this issue. Courts usually disagree over\nwhether to use commercial and industrial taxpayers or railroad com\npetitors as the comparison class. Compare Burlington Northern, S. F.\nR. Co. v.

Perhaps, as the majority asserts, subsection\n(b)(4) is not an ideal candidate for ejusdem generis. Ante,\nat 16\u201317. But given the ambiguity of subsection (b)(4),\n(b)(1) through (3) are the best guides for understanding its\nproper scope\u2014something we recognized in ACF Industries.\n510 U. S., at 343. It is more reasonable to discern the\nmeaning of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d in subsection (b)(4) using the\npreceding subsections than to pluck from the dictionary a\ndefinition for such a context-dependent term.\n   Detaching subsection (b)(4) from the rest of the section\nwould expand its meaning well beyond the scope of the\nproblem that necessitated \u00a711501(b). Instead of simply\neliminating the particular vulnerability of railroads by\ntying their tax fate to that of general commercial and\nindustrial taxpayers, railroads would receive a surprising\nwindfall: most-favored taxpayer status. This would con\nvert subsection (b)(4) from a shield into a sword.\n   The implication of the majority opinion is that if every\nperson and business in the State of Alabama paid a $1\nannual tax, and one person was exempt, CSX could sue\nunder subsection (b)(4) and require the State to either\nexempt CSX also or \u201coffe[r] a sufficient justification\u201d for\nthe distinction. See ante, at 10, n. 8. Although the major\nity denies that this would provide railroads most-favored\ntaxpayer status, see ibid., it acknowledges that States\nwould have to justify any tax distinction that railroads\nargue may disfavor them.\n   The only bulwark against requiring States to give rail\nroads every tax exemption that anyone else gets would be\nopen-ended judicial determinations of what is \u201csufficient\njustification\u201d for such distinctions. Ibid. Unsurprisingly,\nthe statute provides no guidance for what \u201csufficient justi\nfication\u201d might mean, but neither does the majority.\nThere are all sorts of reasons that might lead a State to\n10     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

The rest of\n\u00a711501(b) provides a logical and coherent way to deter\nmine what subsection (b)(4) means, and we have used that\nmethodology before. See ACF Industries, 510 U. S., at\n340. The best way to read subsection (b)(4) is as prohibit\ning taxes that target or single out railroads as compared to\ngeneral commercial and industrial taxpayers. That is the\ntest I would establish, and I do not understand the major\nity to foreclose the lower courts from utilizing it. Under\nthat test, CSX\u2019s challenge to Alabama\u2019s sales and use\ntaxes was properly dismissed.

Argued November 10, 2010\u2014Decided February 22, 2011\nPetitioner (CSX) is an interstate rail carrier that operates, and pays\n  taxes, in Alabama. The State imposes sales and use taxes on rail\n  roads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts their\n  main competitors\u2014interstate motor and water carriers. CSX sued\n  respondents, the Alabama Department of Revenue and its Commis\n  sioner (Alabama), claiming that this tax scheme discriminates\n  against railroads in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and\n  Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4\u2013R Act or Act), which bars four\n  forms of discriminatory taxation, 49 U. S. C. \u00a711501(b). Three of the\n  delineated prohibitions deal with property taxes, \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3),\n  and the fourth is a catch-all provision that forbids a State to\n  \u201c[i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,\u201d\n  \u00a711501(b)(4). The District Court dismissed CSX\u2019s suit as not cogni\n  zable under the 4\u2013R Act on the basis of this Court\u2019s decision in De\n  partment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,\n  and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: CSX may challenge Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes under\n \u00a711501(b)(4). Pp. 5\u201319.\n    (a) CSX is challenging \u201canother tax\u201d within subsection (b)(4)\u2019s plain\n meaning. The Act does not define \u201ctax.\u201d Thus, this Court looks to the\n word\u2019s ordinary definition, which is expansive. A State seeking to\n raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxation on prop\n erty, income, transactions, or activities. \u201c[A]nother tax\u201d is thus best\n understood to encompass any tax a State might impose, on any asset\n or transaction, except the property taxes already addressed in sub\n sections (b)(1)\u2013(3). There is no reason to interpret subsection (b)(4)\n as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes that some States imposed\n2        CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                         REVENUE                                           \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    in lieu of property taxes at the time of the Act\u2019s passage. Moreover,\n    CSX\u2019s complaint, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent view,\n    does protest Alabama\u2019s imposition of taxes on its fuel. The exemp\n    tions the State has given may play a central role in CSX\u2019s argument,\n    but the complaint\u2019s essential subject remains the taxes imposed.\n       The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be said to \u201cdis\n    criminate\u201d against a railroad under subsection (b)(4) where the State\n    has granted exemptions from the tax to other entities (here, the rail\n    road\u2019s competitors). Because the statute does not define \u201cdiscrimi\n    nates,\u201d the Court again looks to the term\u2019s ordinary meaning, which\n    is to fail to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction\n    can be found between those favored and those not favored. To charge\n    one group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4% rate, if the\n    groups are the same in all relevant respects, is to discriminate\n    against the latter. That discrimination continues if the favored\n    group\u2019s rate goes down to 0%, which is all an exemption is. To say\n    that such a tax does not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d is to adopt a definition at odds\n    with the word\u2019s natural meaning. This Court has repeatedly recog\n    nized that tax schemes with exemptions may be discriminatory. See,\n    e.g., Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803. And\n    even Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n    332, on which the Eleventh Circuit heavily relied in dismissing CSX\u2019s\n    suit, made clear that tax exemptions \u201ccould be a variant of tax dis\n    crimination.\u201d Id., at 343. In addition, the statute\u2019s prohibition of dis\n    crimination applies regardless whether the favored entities are inter\n    state or local. The distinctions drawn in the statute are not between\n    interstate and local actors, as Alabama suggests, but between rail\n    roads and all other actors, whether interstate or local. Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) ACF Industries does not require a different result. There, the\n    Court held that railroads could not contest property tax exemptions\n    under subsection (b)(4), reasoning that it would be illogical to permit\n    such a challenge when subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014the \u00a711501 provisions\n    specifically addressing property taxes\u2014permitted States to grant\n    property tax exemptions. Such a reading would \u201csubvert the statu\n    tory plan\u201d and \u201ccontravene the \u2018elementary canon of construction that\n    a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inopera\n    tive.\u2019 \u201d 510 U. S., at 340. Contrary to Alabama\u2019s argument, this\n    structural analysis does not apply here. Subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) spe\n    cifically allow property tax exemptions, but neither they nor any\n    other provision of the Act speaks to non-property exemptions like\n    those at issue here. Because Congress has expressed no intent to\n    \u201callo[w] the States to grant\u201d non-property exemptions, id., at 343,\n    reading subsection (b)(4) to encompass them poses no danger of \u201cnul\n    lify[ing]\u201d a congressional policy choice or otherwise \u201csubverting the\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

(CSX) is an inter\u00ad\nstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama and pays taxes\nthere. Alabama imposes a sales tax of 4% on the gross\nreceipts of retail businesses, Ala. Code \u00a740\u201323\u20132(1) (2010\nCum. Supp.), and a use tax of 4% on the storage, use, or\nconsumption of tangible personal property, \u00a740\u201323\u201361(a)\n(2003). Railroads pay these taxes when they purchase or\nconsume diesel fuel. But railroads\u2019 main competitors\u2014\ninterstate motor and water carriers\u2014are generally exempt\nfrom paying sales and use taxes on their fuel (although\nfuel for motor carriers is subject to a separate excise tax).3\n  Alleging that Alabama\u2019s tax scheme discriminates\nagainst railroads in violation of \u00a711501(b)(4) of the 4\u2013R\nAct, CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of\nRevenue and its Commissioner (Alabama or State), in\nFederal District Court. In particular, CSX complained\nthat the State could not impose sales and use taxes on\nrailroads\u2019 purchase and consumption of diesel fuel while\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The first sentence of subsection (c) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding sec\u00ad\n\ntion 1341 of title 28 . . . a district court of the United States has\njurisdiction . . . to prevent a violation of subsection (b) of this section.\u201d\nThe next sentence concerns the relief available for violations of\n\u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1) and (2): \u201cRelief may be granted under this subsection\nonly if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transpor\u00ad\ntation property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value\nto true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the\nsame assessment jurisdiction.\u201d\n   3 State law provides that motor carriers need not pay sales or use\n\ntaxes on diesel fuel so long as they pay a different excise tax of $0.19\nper gallon. Ala. Code \u00a740\u201317\u20132(1) (2003) (primary tax of $0.13 per\ngallon); \u00a740\u201317\u2013220(e) (2010 Cum. Supp.) (additional tax of $0.06 per\ngallon). State law wholly exempts interstate water carriers from sales\nand use taxes on diesel fuel. \u00a740\u201323\u20134(a)(10); \u00a740\u201323\u201362(12).

Appx. 318 (2009). The Elev\u00ad\nenth Circuit rested on its earlier decision in Norfolk\nSouthern R. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550 F. 3d\n1306 (2008), which involved a nearly identical challenge to\nthe application of Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes.\n   In Norfolk Southern, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the\nplaintiff railroad\u2019s challenge, principally in reliance on this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF\nIndustries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332 (1994). In that case, we\nheld that a railroad could not invoke \u00a711501(b)(4) to chal\u00ad\nlenge a generally applicable property tax on the basis that\ncertain non-railroad property was exempt from the tax.\nId., at 335. The Eleventh Circuit recognized that the case\nbefore it involved sales and use taxes\u2014not property taxes,\nwhich the statutory scheme separately addresses. Norfolk\nSouthern, 550 F. 3d, at 1314. The court concluded, how\u00ad\never, that this difference was immaterial, and accordingly\nheld that a railroad could not object to Alabama\u2019s sales\nand use taxes simply because the State provides exemp\u00ad\ntions from them. Id., at 1316.\n   CSX petitioned for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the\nEleventh Circuit had misunderstood ACF Industries and\nnoting a split of authority concerning whether railroads\nmay bring a challenge under \u00a711501(b)(4) to non-property\ntaxes from which their competitors are exempt.4 We\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Compare Norfolk Southern R.

To\ndetermine whether this suit may go forward, we must\ntherefore answer two questions. Is CSX challenging \u201can\u00ad\nother tax\u201d within the meaning of the statute? And, if so,\nmight that tax \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against rail carriers by\nexempting their competitors?5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nton No. R. Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 606 N.

W.\n2d 338, 348 (Iowa 1983) (same).\n   5 We consider here only questions relating to whether CSX can bring\n\na claim for discrimination based on the State\u2019s pattern of tax exemp\u00ad\ntions. We do not consider any issues concerning whether these exemp\u00ad\ntions actually discriminate against CSX. See infra, at 18\u201319, and n. 8.\nAlabama has raised two such issues in this Court. First, Alabama\ncontends that in deciding CSX\u2019s claim, a federal court must consider\nnot only the specific taxes challenged, but also the broader tax scheme.\nBrief for Respondents 58\u201360. Second, the State argues that the court\nmust compare the taxation of CSX not merely to direct competitors\nbut to other commercial entities as well. Id., at 48, n. 7. Most of the\ndissenting opinion is devoted to supporting the State\u2019s argument on\nthis second question. But we leave these and all other issues relating\nto whether Alabama actually has discriminated against CSX to the\ntrial court on remand to address as and when it wishes. No court in\nthis case has previously considered these questions, and the parties\u2019\nbriefs in this Court have only sketchily addressed them. In addition,\nthe parties dispute whether Alabama waived its claim on the second\nissue by initially agreeing that \u201cthe comparison class consists of motor\ncarriers and water carriers,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted), and proceeding with the litigation on that basis.\n6      CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                        REVENUE                                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   An excise tax, like Alabama\u2019s sales and use tax, is \u201can\u00ad\nother tax\u201d under subsection (b)(4).6 The 4\u2013R Act does not\ndefine \u201ctax\u201d; nor does the statute otherwise place any\nmatters within, or exclude any matters from, the term\u2019s\nambit. In these circumstances, we look to the word\u2019s\nordinary definition, Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513\nU. S. 179, 187 (1995), and we note what taxpayers have\nlong since discovered\u2014that the meaning of \u201ctax\u201d is expan\u00ad\nsive. A State (or other governmental entity) seeking to\nraise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxa\u00ad\ntion on property, income, transactions, or activities.\n\u201c[A]nother tax,\u201d as used in subsection (b)(4), is best under\u00ad\nstood to refer to all of these\u2014more precisely, to encompass\nany form of tax a State might impose, on any asset or\ntransaction, except the taxes on property previously ad\u00ad\ndressed in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3). See Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Superior, 932 F. 2d 1185, 1186 (CA7 1991) (Sub\u00ad\nsection (b)(4) includes \u201can income tax, a gross-receipts tax,\na use tax, an occupation tax . . . \u2014whatever\u201d). The phrase\n\u201canother tax\u201d is a catch-all.\n   In particular, we see no reason to interpret subsection\n(b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes\u2014known\nas \u201cin lieu\u201d taxes\u2014that some States imposed instead of\nproperty taxes at the time of the Act\u2019s passage. See Brief\nfor Respondents 53\u201355; Brief for State of Washington\net al. as Amici Curiae 20\u201322. The argument in favor of\nthis construction relies on the House Report concerning\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWe think this question of waiver is also best considered by the trial\ncourt.\n  6 As originally enacted, the provision that is now 49 U. S. C.\n\n\u00a711501(b)(4) prohibited the imposition of \u201cany other tax\u201d that discrimi\u00ad\nnates against a railroad. \u00a726c (1976 ed.). The substitution of \u201canother\ntax\u201d occurred when Congress first recodified the Act. In line with\nCongress\u2019s statement that revisions made at that time should not be\nconstrued as having substantive effect, see n. 1, supra, we treat the two\nterms as synonymous.\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

R.\nRep. No. 94\u2013725, p. 77 (1975). But the Conference Report\non the final bill abandoned the House Report\u2019s narrowing\nlanguage and described the subsection as it was written\u2014\nas prohibiting, without limitation, \u201cthe imposition of any\nother tax which results in the discriminatory treatment of\nany\u201d railroad. S. Conf. Rep. No. 94\u2013595, pp. 165\u2013166\n(1976); accord, S. Rep. No. 94\u2013499, p. 65 (1975). And the\nstatutory language is the real crux of the matter: Subsec\u00ad\ntion (b)(4) speaks both clearly and broadly, and a legisla\u00ad\ntive report misdescribing the provision cannot succeed in\naltering it.7\n   Nor do we agree with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent\nview that CSX does not challenge \u201canother tax\u201d because its\ncomplaint relies on the exemptions the State has given.\nSee Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1315 (\u201cThe language of\nsection (b)(4) prohibits a discriminatory \u2018tax\u2019 not a dis\u00ad\ncriminatory tax exemption\u201d); Brief for American Trucking\nAssns., Inc. as Amicus Curiae 9. What the complaint\nprotests is Alabama\u2019s imposition of taxes on the fuel CSX\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Alabama also invokes the remedial provision of subsection (c), n. 2,\n\nsupra, to urge that we read \u00a711501 as effectively limited to property or\n\u201cin lieu\u201d taxes. According to Alabama, that provision entitles federal\ncourts to grant relief only when States overvalue railroad property\nunder subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2): Federal courts, the State avers,\n\u201chave no power to enjoin the granting of tax exemptions as a violation\nof subsection (b)(4), or, apparently [to remedy] any violation of sub-\nsection (b)(4).\u201d Brief for Respondents 37. But that interpretation of\nsubsection (c)\u2019s remedial provision cannot be right, because it would\nnullify subsection (b)(4) (and, for that matter, subsection (b)(3) as well).\nWe understand subsection (c)\u2019s remedial provision neither as limiting\nthe broad grant of jurisdiction to federal courts to prevent violations of\nsubsection (b) nor as otherwise restricting the scope of that subsection.\nThe remedial provision simply limits the availability of relief when a\nState discriminates in assessing the value of railroad property, as\nproscribed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). That kind of discrimination\nis not at issue here.\n8     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nuses; what the complaint requests is that Alabama cease\nto collect those taxes from CSX. App. 23. The exemptions,\nno doubt, play a central role in CSX\u2019s argument: They\ndemonstrate, in CSX\u2019s view, that the State\u2019s sales and use\ntaxes discriminate against railroads. See id., at 22, \u00b6\u00b624\u2013\n26. But the essential subject of the complaint remains the\ntaxes Alabama levies on CSX.\n   The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be\nsaid to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against a railroad under subsection\n(b)(4) because the State has granted exemptions from the\ntax to other entities (here, the railroad\u2019s competitors). The\nstatute does not define \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d and so we again\nlook to the ordinary meaning of the word. See supra, at 5.\n\u201cDiscrimination\u201d is the \u201cfailure to treat all persons equally\nwhen no reasonable distinction can be found between\nthose favored and those not favored.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dic\u00ad\ntionary 534 (9th ed. 2009); accord, id., at 420 (5th ed.\n1979); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\u00ad\ntionary 648 (1976) (\u201cdiscriminates\u201d means \u201cto make a\ndifference in treatment or favor on a class or categorical\nbasis in disregard of individual merit\u201d). To charge one\ngroup of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4%\nrate, if the groups are the same in all relevant respects,\nis to discriminate against the latter. That discrimination\ncontinues (indeed, it increases) if the State takes the\nfavored group\u2019s rate down to 0%. And that is all an ex\u00ad\nemption is. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512\nU. S. 186, 210\u2013211 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment) (noting that an \u201c \u2018exemption\u2019 from . . . a \u2018neutral\u2019 tax\u201d\nfor favored persons \u201cis no different in principle\u201d than \u201ca\ndiscriminatory tax . . . imposing a higher liability\u201d on\ndisfavored persons). To say that such a tax (with such an\nexemption) does not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d\u2014assuming the groups\nare similarly situated and there is no justification for the\ndifference in treatment\u2014is to adopt a definition of the\nterm at odds with its natural meaning.\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  In line with this understanding, our decisions have\nrepeatedly recognized that tax schemes with exemptions\nmay be discriminatory. In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), for example, we reviewed a\nstate income tax provision that exempted retirement\nbenefits given by the State, but not those paid by the\nFederal Government. We held that the tax \u201cdiscrimi\u00ad\nnate[d]\u201d against federal employees under 4 U. S. C. \u00a7111,\nwhich serves to protect those employees from discrimina\u00ad\ntory state taxation. Similarly, our dormant Commerce\nClause cases have often held that tax exemptions given to\nlocal businesses discriminate against interstate actors.\nSee, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,\n268\u2013269 (1984) (holding that a state excise tax on alcohol\n\u201cdiscriminate[d]\u201d against interstate businesses because of\nexemptions granted to local producers); Camps New\u00ad\nfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564,\n588\u2013589 (1997) (invalidating as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d a state\nproperty tax that exempted organizations operating for\nthe benefit of residents, but not organizations aimed at\nnonresidents). And even our decision in ACF Industries,\non which the Eleventh Circuit relied in dismissing CSX\u2019s\nsuit, made clear that tax exemptions \u201ccould be a variant of\ntax discrimination.\u201d 510 U. S., at 343.\n  Nor does the 4\u2013R Act limit the prohibited discrimination\nto state tax schemes that unjustifiably exempt local actors,\nas opposed to interstate entities. Alabama argues for this\nresult, claiming that \u00a711501(b) is designed \u201cto protect\ninterstate carriers against discrimination vis-\u00e0-vis local\nbusinesses.\u201d Brief for Respondents 29. But the text of\n\u00a711501(b) tells a different story. Consistent with the Act\u2019s\npurpose of restoring the financial stability of railroads (not\nof interstate carriers generally), supra, at 1, each of sub\u00ad\nsection (b)\u2019s provisions proscribes taxes that specially\nburden a rail carrier\u2019s property or otherwise discriminate\nagainst a rail carrier. And not a single provision of the\n10     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                        REVENUE                                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nAct (including the references in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) to\n\u201ccommercial and industrial property\u201d) distinguishes be\u00ad\ntween local and non-local taxpayers who receive favorable\ntax treatment. The distinctions drawn in \u00a711501(b) are\nnot between interstate and local actors, as the State con\u00ad\ntends, but rather between railroads and other actors,\nwhether interstate or local. Accordingly, a state excise tax\nthat applies to railroads but exempts their interstate\ncompetitors is subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4)\nas a \u201ctax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\u201d8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 This conclusion does not, as Alabama and the dissent contend, turn\n\nrailroads into \u201cmost-favored-taxpayers,\u201d entitled to any exemption (or\nother tax break) that a State gives to another entity. See Brief for\nRespondents 23; post, at 9 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). We hold only that\n\u00a711501(b)(4) enables a railroad to challenge an excise or other non\u00ad\nproperty tax as discriminatory on the basis of the tax scheme\u2019s exemp\u00ad\ntions\u2014as the dissent apparently agrees, post, at 1. Whether the\nrailroad will prevail\u2014that is, whether it can prove the alleged dis\u00ad\ncrimination\u2014depends on whether the State offers a sufficient justifica\u00ad\ntion for declining to provide the exemption at issue to rail carriers. See\nsupra, at 8; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25\u201326; Richmond,\nF. & P. R. Co. v. Department of Taxation, Commonwealth of Va., 762\nF. 2d 375, 380\u2013381, and n. 4 (CA4 1985). So if, to use the dissent\u2019s\nexample, a railroad challenged a scheme in which \u201cevery person and\nbusiness in the State of Alabama paid a $1 annual tax, and one person\nwas exempt,\u201d post, at 9, for some reason having nothing to do with\nrailroads, we presume the suit would be promptly dismissed. Nothing\nin this application of \u00a711501(b)(4) offers a \u201cwindfall\u201d to railroads. Ibid.\n   The dissent argues in addition that a State should prevail against\nany claim of discrimination brought under subsection (b)(4) if it can\ndemonstrate that a tax does not \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201csingle out\u201d a railroad, post,\nat 1; that showing, without more, would justify the tax (although the\ndissent declines to say just what it means to \u201ctarget,\u201d post, at 7, n. 3).\nThis argument primarily concerns the question whether Alabama\u2019s tax\nscheme in fact discriminates under subsection (b)(4)\u2014a question we\nhave explained is inappropriate to address, see n. 5, supra. We note,\nhowever, that the dissent\u2019s argument about subsection (b)(4) rests\nentirely on the premise that subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) prohibit only prop\u00ad\nerty taxes that \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201csingle out\u201d railroads, see post, at 4; so, the\ndissent would say, a State may impose a 4% property tax on railroads\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

The first claim, which the Eleventh Circuit\naccepted, rests on the reasoning we adopted in ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries: We concluded there that railroads could not chal\u00ad\nlenge property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4),\nand Alabama asserts that the same analysis applies to ex-\ncise (and other non-property) tax exemptions. The second\ncontention focuses on alleged problems that would emerge\nin the application of \u00a711501(b) if the rule of ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries did not govern all tax exemptions. On this view, even\nif ACF Industries\u2019 reasoning is irrelevant to cases involv\u00ad\ning excise taxes, its holding must extend to those cases to\nprevent inconsistent or anomalous results. We reject each\nof these arguments. We stand foursquare behind our\ndecision in ACF Industries, but we will not extend it in the\nway the State wishes.\n                              A\n  In ACF Industries, we considered whether a railroad\ncould sue a State under subsection (b)(4) for taxing rail\u00ad\nroad property while exempting certain other commercial\nproperty. We held that the railroad could not do so. We\nnoted that the language of subsection (b)(4), when viewed\nin isolation, could be read to allow such a challenge. But\nwe reasoned that the structure of \u00a711501 required the\nopposite result. 510 U. S., at 343. The Eleventh Circuit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(assuming some unspecified number of other taxpayers also pay that\nrate) while levying only a 2% property tax on railroad competitors. But\nwe have never decided, in ACF Industries or any other case, whether\nsubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) should be interpreted in this manner. And even\naccepting the dissent\u2019s unexplained premise, a serious question would\nremain about whether to transplant this construction of subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) to subsection (b)(4)\u2019s very different terrain, see infra, at 16\u2013\n18.\n12    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                               \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nconsidered ACF Industries \u201cdeterminative\u201d of the question\nhere, Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1313, and Alabama\nagrees, Brief for Respondents 18. We think they misread\nthat decision.\n  We began our analysis in ACF Industries by explaining\nthat railroads could not challenge property tax exemptions\nunder subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014the provisions of \u00a711501\nspecifically addressing property taxes. As noted earlier,\nsubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) prohibit a State from imposing\nhigher property tax rates or assessment ratios on \u201crail\ntransportation property\u201d than on \u201cother commercial and\nindustrial property.\u201d The statute defines \u201ccommercial and\nindustrial property\u201d as including only \u201cproperty . . . subject\nto a property tax levy.\u201d \u00a711501(a)(4). We interpreted that\nphrase to mean \u201cproperty that is taxed,\u201d rather than\nproperty that is potentially taxable. 510 U. S., at 341\u2013342.\nAs a result, we determined that exempt (i.e., non-taxed)\nproperty fell outside the category of \u201cother commercial and\nindustrial property\u201d against which the taxation of railroad\nproperty is measured. Ibid. The conclusion followed:\nSubsections (b)(1)\u2013(3) permitted States to impose property\ntaxes on railroads while exempting other entities. Ibid.\n  And because that was so, we stated, still another con\u00ad\nclusion followed: Subsection (b)(4)\u2019s prohibition on dis\u00ad\ncrimination likewise could not encompass property tax\nexemptions. Id., at 343. We viewed this holding as a\nmatter of simple deduction: \u201cIt would be illogical to con\u00ad\nclude that Congress, having allowed the States to grant\nproperty tax exemptions in subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3), would\nturn around and nullify its own choice in subsection\n(b)(4).\u201d Ibid. Or stated otherwise: \u201c[R]eading subsection\n(b)(4) to prohibit what\u201d other parts of the statute were\n\u201cdesigned to allow,\u201d would \u201csubvert the statutory plan\u201d\nand \u201ccontravene the \u2018elementary canon of construction\nthat a statute should be interpreted so as not to render\none part inoperative.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 340. The structure of\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) specifically address\u2014and allow\u2014property tax\nexemptions. But neither those subsections nor any other\nprovision of the 4\u2013R Act speaks to non-property tax ex\u00ad\nemptions like those at issue in this case. Congress has\nexpressed no intent to \u201callo[w] the States to grant\u201d these\nexemptions. Ibid. Reading subsection (b)(4) as written\u2014\nto encompass non-property tax exemptions\u2014therefore\nposes no danger of \u201cnullify[ing]\u201d a congressional policy\nchoice or otherwise \u201csubvert[ing] the statutory plan.\u201d Id.,\nat 340, 343. To the contrary: Giving subsection (b)(4)\nsomething other than its ordinary meaning, absent any\nstructural reason to do so, would itself contravene the\nexpressed will of Congress.\n   Implicitly acknowledging that ACF Industries\u2019 central\ntheory is irrelevant here, Alabama focuses on what that\ndecision called \u201c[o]ther considerations reinforc[ing]\u201d its\nstructural analysis. Id., at 343. Most notably, Alabama\nunderscores the following sentence from ACF Industries:\n\u201cGiven the prevalence of property tax exemptions when\nCongress enacted the 4\u2013R Act, [\u00a711501\u2019s] silence on the\nsubject\u2014in light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and\nassessment ratio discrimination\u2014reflects a determination\nto permit the States to leave their exemptions in place.\u201d\nId., at 344. Alabama asserts that this statement \u201cholds\njust as true\u201d for sales and use taxes. Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 41.\n   That claim rings hollow. To be sure, ACF Industries\nnoted that Congress had declined to speak \u201cwith any\ndegree of particularity to\u201d the permissibility of property\ntax exemptions, even though States often granted them.\n510 U. S., at 343. But we thought that fact relevant only\n14    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause Congress had spoken with particularity in pro\u00ad\nscribing other forms of discriminatory property taxes. The\nvery sentence Alabama highlights makes our reasoning\nclear: Congress\u2019s silence as to the practice of granting\nproperty tax exemptions reflected its acquiescence in that\npractice \u201cin light of the explicit prohibition [in subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3)] of [property] tax rate and assessment ratio\ndiscrimination.\u201d Id., at 344 (emphasis added). If that\nexplicit prohibition had not existed\u2014if \u00a711501(b) had\nconsisted only of subsection (b)(4)\u2019s broad ban on tax\ndiscrimination\u2014we could not have gleaned what we did\nfrom congressional silence. After all, the very purpose of a\ncatch-all provision like subsection (b)(4) is to avoid the\nnecessity of listing each matter (here, each kind of tax\ndiscrimination) falling within it. And with respect to non\u00ad\nproperty taxes (like Alabama\u2019s sales and use taxes), sub\u00ad\nsection (b)(4) is all there is. So here again, our analysis in\nACF Industries does not apply because it rested on subsec\u00ad\ntions (b)(1)\u2013(3)\u2014that is, on the highly reticulated scheme\nin the 4\u2013R Act relating solely to property taxes.\n   Alabama also emphasizes our statement in ACF Indus\u00ad\ntries that \u201c \u2018[p]rinciples of federalism\u2019 \u201d supported our hold\u00ad\ning, Brief for Respondents 41\u201343 (quoting 510 U. S., at\n345), but this final effort to borrow from that decision\u2019s\nanalysis similarly fails. We indeed recognized in ACF\nIndustries that the 4\u2013R Act limits the traditional taxing\npower of the States. Because that is so, we expressed\n\u201chesitan[ce] to extend the statute beyond its evident\nscope.\u201d 510 U. S., at 345. But here, for all the reasons\nalready noted, we are not \u201cextend[ing] the statute\u201d; we are\nmerely giving effect to its clear meaning. To reiterate: The\n4\u2013R Act distinguishes between property taxes and other\ntaxes. Congress expressed its intent to insulate property\ntax exemptions from challenge; against that background,\nACF Industries stated that permitting such suits would\nintrude on the States\u2019 rightful authority. By contrast,\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Principles of\nfederalism cannot narrow \u00a711501\u2019s clear scope. See, e.g.,\nCSX Transp., Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Equalization,\n552 U. S. 9, 20 (2007) (rejecting the idea that federalism\nprinciples preclude challenges to state valuation method\u00ad\nologies when \u00a711501 \u201cclearly authorized\u201d such actions).\nNothing in ACF Industries suggested otherwise.\n                             B\n   Alabama additionally makes a subtler argument involv\u00ad\ning ACF Industries. Given that decision, Alabama con\u00ad\ntends, a ruling in CSX\u2019s favor here would create troubling\ninconsistencies. Alabama claims that subsection (b)(4)\u2019s\nsingular prohibition on \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d would then\nmean one thing for property taxes (according to ACF\nIndustries) and another for non-property taxes, even\nthough nothing in the statute supports \u201cmorphing defini\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Brief for Respondents 32. And still worse than the\ndifference in meaning would be the difference in result:\nA ruling for CSX, Alabama argues, would give railroads\nmore protection against non-property taxes than against\nproperty taxes, even though no good reason exists for this\ndistinction.\n   Alabama\u2019s one-word-two-meanings argument collapses\nbecause it again rests on a misunderstanding of ACF\nIndustries. That decision did not define \u201cdiscriminat[e]\u201d or\nsay that a tax exemption could not fall within that term.\nQuite to the contrary: As noted earlier, ACF Industries\nfrankly acknowledged that tax exemptions, including\nproperty tax exemptions, \u201ccould be a variant of tax dis\u00ad\ncrimination.\u201d 510 U. S., at 343; supra, at 9. We held that\nproperty tax exemptions were immune from challenge\nunder subsection (b)(4) for structural, rather than linguis\u00ad\ntic, reasons. Even assuming these exemptions \u201cdiscrimi\u00ad\n16    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                 \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnate[d],\u201d they did so in a way that the specific provisions of\n\u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3) allow, and accordingly \u00a711501(b)(4)\u2019s\nprohibition could not include them. That reasoning, once\nmore, does not apply here, because subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3)\ndo not permit\u2014indeed, in no way address\u2014non-property\ntax exemptions. We therefore do not adopt a new defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201cdiscriminate\u201d in this case; in the context of the 4\u2013R\nAct, that word has, and has always had, just one meaning.\n   What remains is Alabama\u2019s complaint that a ruling in\nCSX\u2019s favor, when combined with our decision in ACF\nIndustries, will result in divergent treatment of property\nand non-property taxes. At times, Alabama dresses up\nthis objection in Latin: It contends that the canon of ejus\u00ad\ndem generis, which \u201climits general terms [that] follow\nspecific ones to matters similar to those specified,\u201d Gooch\nv. United States, 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936), has a role to\nplay in interpreting \u00a711501(b). More particularly, Ala\u00ad\nbama contends that this canon supports reading into\n\u00a711501(b)(4) every limitation contained in \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013\n(3), including the exclusion of tax exemptions from the\nclass of state actions subject to challenge. See Brief for\nRespondents 26\u201327. That interpretive move, Alabama\nrightly notes, would ensure equal treatment of property\ntax and non-property tax exemptions.\n   But we think ejusdem generis is not relevant here. As\nan initial matter, subsection (b)(4), \u201c[a]lthough something\nof a catchall, . . . is not a general or collective term follow\u00ad\ning a list of specific items to which a particular statutory\ncommand is applicable (e.g., \u2018fishing rods, nets, hooks,\nbobbers, sinkers, and other equipment\u2019).\u201d United States v.\nAguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Rather, that subsection is\n\u201cone of . . . several distinct and independent prohibitions.\u201d\nIbid. Related to this structural point is a functional one.\nWe typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general\nword will not render specific words meaningless. E.g.,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 114\u2013115\n(2001); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and\nStatutory Construction \u00a747:17 (7th ed. 2007). But that\nconcern is absent here. Reading subsection (b)(4) to cover\nnon-property tax exemptions will not deprive subsections\n(b)(1)\u2013(3) of effect, because those subsections are ad\u00ad\ndressed only to property taxes. A canon meaning literally\n\u201cof the same kind\u201d has no application to provisions di\u00ad\nrected toward dissimilar subject matter.\n   The better version of Alabama\u2019s claim reads entirely in\nEnglish; it is simply that distinguishing between property\ntax exemptions and other tax exemptions makes not a\nwhit of sense. We are not much inclined to disagree.\nNeither CSX nor the United States as amicus curiae has\noffered a satisfying reason for why Congress drew this\nline\u2014why in \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3) it barred challenges based\non property tax exemptions, but then turned around in\n\u00a711501(b)(4) to allow challenges based on, say, excise tax\nexemptions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20135, 24\u201325. CSX, for\nexample, has not presented any evidence that different tax\nexemptions posed different levels of threat to railroads\u2019\nfinancial stability. So even if Congress had a good reason\nfor distinguishing between property and non-property tax\nexemptions, we acknowledge that it eludes us.\n   But this admission does not take us far in Alabama\u2019s\ndirection. Even if the 4\u2013R Act were ambiguous, we doubt\nwe would interpret subsection (b)(4) to replicate each facet\nof subsections (b)(1)\u2013(3). Treating property tax exemp\u00ad\ntions and other tax exemptions equivalently might make\nsense, as Alabama argues. But so too might allowing\nrailroads to challenge all taxes (property or non-property)\nthat contain exemptions. After all, as we noted earlier,\ntax exemptions are an obvious form of tax discrimination.\nSee supra, at 8\u20139. It is hardly self-evident why Congress\nwould prohibit a State from charging a railroad a 4% tax\nand a competitor a 2% tax, but allow the State to charge\n18    CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF \n\n                       REVENUE                                 \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe railroad a 4% tax and the competitor nothing. The\nlatter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act\neven more than the former. In ACF Industries, we ac\u00ad\ncepted that anomaly because the terms and structure of\nthe Act demanded that we do so. But we could say no\nmore in favor of the result than that it was \u201cnot so bizarre\nthat Congress could not have intended it.\u201d 510 U. S., at\n347 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was not a\nglowing recommendation, and we see no reason today to\nview the matter differently. Accordingly, even assuming\nthat statutory ambiguity permitted us to do so, we would\nhesitate to extend the distinction between tax exemptions\nand differential tax rates in order to avoid a distinction\nbetween property and non-property taxes. That would\nseem a poor trade of statutory anomalies.\n   In any event, and more importantly, the choice is not\nours to make. Congress wrote the statute it wrote, and\nthat statute draws a sharp line between property taxes\nand other taxes. Congress drafted \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3) to\nexclude tax exemptions from the sphere of prohibited\nproperty tax discrimination. But it drafted \u00a711501(b)(4)\nmore broadly, without any of the prior subsections\u2019 limita\u00ad\ntions, to proscribe other \u201ctax[es] that discriminat[e],\u201d\nincluding through the use of exemptions. That congres\u00ad\nsional election settles this case. Alabama\u2019s preference for\nsymmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute. And its\npreference for the greatest possible latitude to levy taxes\ncannot trump Congress\u2019s decision to restrict discrimina\u00ad\ntory taxation of rail carriers.\n                            IV\n  Our decision in this case is limited.

Alabama argues, in\nsupport of barring CSX\u2019s challenge at the outset, that this\ninquiry into discrimination may pose difficulties. Brief for\nRespondents 35\u201337. We cannot deny that assertion, but\nneither can we respond to it by precluding CSX\u2019s claim.\nDiscrimination cases sometimes do raise knotty questions\nabout whether and when dissimilar treatment is ade\u00ad\nquately justified. In the context of the 4\u2013R Act, those hard\ncalls can arise when States charge different tax rates to\ndifferent entities in a practice the statute specifically\nsubjects to challenge. See \u00a711501(b)(3). So too, difficult\nissues can emerge when, as here, States provide certain\nentities with tax exemptions.

We did precisely that\nin Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc.,\n510 U. S. 332 (1994), where we similarly faced a question\nabout the meaning of subsection (b)(4). In that case, our\nstructural analysis of \u00a711501(b) was \u201ccentral to the inter\npretation of subsection (b)(4).\u201d Id., at 340.\n                               1\n   The structure of \u00a711501(b) is straightforward. Subsec\ntions (b)(1) through (3) instruct that States may not assess\nrailroad property at \u201ca higher ratio to the true market\nvalue . . . than . . . other commercial and industrial prop\nerty,\u201d 49 U.

Subsection (b)(4) then\nforbids \u201c[i]mpos[ing] another tax that discriminates\nagainst a rail carrier.\u201d\n   I would look to subsections (b)(1) through (3) to deter\nmine the meaning of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d in (b)(4). As many\nlower courts have correctly recognized, subsection (b)(4)\nis a residual clause, naturally appurtenant to subsections\n(b)(1) through (3).1 Moreover, the phrase \u201canother tax that\ndiscriminates\u201d in subsection (b)(4) suggests that the previ\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See,e.g., Kansas City Southern R.

See\nWashington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.\nGuardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.

First, the \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d\naddressed in subsections (b)(1) through (3) can only be\ndescribed as taxes that target or single out railroad prop\nerty. Those subsections specifically concern taxes that\naffect railroad property differently from the way they\naffect a larger class of comparative taxpayers\u2019 property.\nSee \u00a7\u00a711501(b)(1)\u2013(3); cf. ante, at 9 (\u201c[E]ach of subsection\n(b)\u2019s provisions proscribes taxes that specially burden a\nrail carrier\u2019s property or otherwise discriminate against a\nrail carrier\u201d (emphasis deleted)).

As we found in ACF\nIndustries, the structure of the statute provides a light by\nwhich to navigate the meaning of subsection (b)(4).\n                             2\n  The background of \u00a711501(b) also supports this under\nstanding of subsection (b)(4). In previous cases, we have\nidentified the problem that made subsection (b) necessary.\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

In this way, subsections (b)(1) through\n(3) establish a political check on the taxation of rail\nroads. States cannot impose excessive property taxes on\nthe nonvoting, nonresident railroads without imposing\nthe same taxes more generally on voting, resident local\nbusinesses.\n   Absent any indication that subsection (b)(4), as a resid\nual clause, has any different aim, it is reasonable to con\nclude that it shares the same one as subsections (b)(1)\nthrough (3).

Thus, when the majority says that \u201ca\nstate excise tax that applies to railroads but exempts their\ninterstate competitors is subject to challenge under sub\nsection (b)(4),\u201d ante, at 10, it must mean only that a tax\nexemption scheme could potentially violate subsection\n(b)(4).\n  As I understand it, the majority does not decide whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Although the majority rightly observes that whether a given tax is\n\ndiscriminatory may often be a difficult question, see ante, at 19, this is\nnot a close case. I therefore need not define the exact boundaries of\nwhat constitutes targeting or singling out. See, e.g., Norfolk Southern\nR. Co. v.

But the\n\nquestion presented was: \u201cWhether a State\u2019s exemptions of rail carrier\ncompetitors, but not rail carriers, from generally applicable sales and\nuse taxes on fuel subject the taxes to challenge under 49 U.

Accordingly, States remain\nfree to argue\u2014and lower courts to hold\u2014that complaints\nlike CSX\u2019s should be dismissed for failing to state a \u201cdis\ncriminat[ion]\u201d claim under \u00a711501(b)(4) when they do not\nallege that railroads are targeted or singled out compared\nto commercial and industrial taxpayers generally.\n   Nonetheless, despite the majority\u2019s assertion that it is\n\u201cinappropriate\u201d to address whether Alabama\u2019s tax scheme\nactually discriminates within the meaning of \u00a711501(b)(4),\nante, at 10, n. 8, parts of its opinion suggest an answer to\nthat question that I believe is incorrect. Relying on the\nsecond definition in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, the majority\ndefines \u201cdiscriminates\u201d as \u201c \u2018failure to treat all persons\nequally when no reasonable distinction can be found be\ntween those favored and those not favored.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8.\nThis definition of \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d combined with the major\nity\u2019s insistence that the \u201cdistinctions drawn in \u00a711501(b)\nare . . . between railroads and other actors, whether inter\nstate or local,\u201d suggests that the comparison class could be\nanyone.4 Ante, at 10. The majority ultimately implies that\n\u201canother tax that discriminates against a rail carrier\u201d is\nany tax that draws a distinction between a rail carrier and\nanyone else without sufficient justification.

Perhaps, as the majority asserts, subsection\n(b)(4) is not an ideal candidate for ejusdem generis. Ante,\nat 16\u201317. But given the ambiguity of subsection (b)(4),\n(b)(1) through (3) are the best guides for understanding its\nproper scope\u2014something we recognized in ACF Industries.\n510 U. S., at 343. It is more reasonable to discern the\nmeaning of \u201cdiscriminates\u201d in subsection (b)(4) using the\npreceding subsections than to pluck from the dictionary a\ndefinition for such a context-dependent term.\n   Detaching subsection (b)(4) from the rest of the section\nwould expand its meaning well beyond the scope of the\nproblem that necessitated \u00a711501(b). Instead of simply\neliminating the particular vulnerability of railroads by\ntying their tax fate to that of general commercial and\nindustrial taxpayers, railroads would receive a surprising\nwindfall: most-favored taxpayer status. This would con\nvert subsection (b)(4) from a shield into a sword.\n   The implication of the majority opinion is that if every\nperson and business in the State of Alabama paid a $1\nannual tax, and one person was exempt, CSX could sue\nunder subsection (b)(4) and require the State to either\nexempt CSX also or \u201coffe[r] a sufficient justification\u201d for\nthe distinction. See ante, at 10, n. 8. Although the major\nity denies that this would provide railroads most-favored\ntaxpayer status, see ibid., it acknowledges that States\nwould have to justify any tax distinction that railroads\nargue may disfavor them.\n   The only bulwark against requiring States to give rail\nroads every tax exemption that anyone else gets would be\nopen-ended judicial determinations of what is \u201csufficient\njustification\u201d for such distinctions. Ibid. Unsurprisingly,\nthe statute provides no guidance for what \u201csufficient justi\nfication\u201d might mean, but neither does the majority.\nThere are all sorts of reasons that might lead a State to\n10     CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

The best way to read subsection (b)(4) is as prohibit\ning taxes that target or single out railroads as compared to\ngeneral commercial and industrial taxpayers. That is the\ntest I would establish, and I do not understand the major\nity to foreclose the lower courts from utilizing it.
