WYETH LLC, FKA WYETH, INC.,\n                      ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09\u2013152.      Argued October 12, 2010\u2014Decided February 22, 2011\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) cre\n  ated a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market\n  adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation\n  and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing le\n  gitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult. The Act\n  provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a peti\n  tion for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the\n  Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the\n  court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the\n  claimant can then decide whether to accept the court\u2019s judgment or\n  reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer. Awards\n  are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.\n  As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability pro\n  tections. Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability\n  for a vaccine\u2019s unavoidable, adverse side effects.\n     Hannah Bruesewitz\u2019s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the\n  Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled af\n  ter receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine\n  manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent\n  Wyeth). After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the\n  unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, al\n  leging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederle\u2019s DTP vaccine\n  caused Hannah\u2019s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict\n  liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania com\n  mon law. Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court. It\n  granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Penn\n  sylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1), which\n2                     BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    provides that \u201c[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death asso\n    ciated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if\n    the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable\n    even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\n    by proper directions and warnings.\u201d The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine\n manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury\n or death caused by a vaccine\u2019s side effects. Pp. 7\u201319.\n    (a) Section 300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s text suggests that a vaccine\u2019s design is\n not open to question in a tort action. If a manufacturer could be held\n liable for failure to use a different design, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\n would do no work. A vaccine side effect could always have been\n avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful\n element. The language of the provision thus suggests the design is\n not subject to question in a tort action. What the statute establishes\n as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufac\n ture and warning) with respect to the particular design. This conclu\n sion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law es\n tablishes three grounds for liability\u2014defective manufacture,\n inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design\u2014the Act\n mentions only manufacture and warnings. It thus seems that the\n Act\u2019s failure to mention design-defect liability is \u201cby deliberate choice,\n not inadvertence.\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.\n Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument, there is no reason to believe\n that \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s term \u201cunavoidable\u201d is a term of art incorporat\n ing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A, Comment k, which exempts\n from strict liability rules \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d \u201cUnavoid\n able\u201d is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k\n attach special significance only to the term \u201cunavoidably unsafe\n products,\u201d not the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d standing alone. Moreover,\n reading the phrase \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d to exempt in\n juries caused by flawed design would require treating \u201ceven though\u201d\n as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a\n concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause\n weakens or qualifies the other. The canon against superfluity does\n not undermine this Court\u2019s interpretation because petitioners\u2019 com\n peting interpretation has superfluity problems of its own. Pp. 8\u201312.\n    (c) The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general\n reinforces what \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s text suggests. Design defects do\n not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Admini\n stration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufactur\n ing process. This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men\n  tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men\n  tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act\u2019s mandates\n  lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve\n  ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,\n  which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de\n  sign-defect torts\u2014prompting the development of improved designs,\n  and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act\u2019s struc\n  tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine\n  manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for\n  vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the\n  occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund\n  the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de\n  fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar\n  ket.

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncines became, one might say, victims of their own success.\nThey had been so effective in preventing infectious dis\neases that the public became much less alarmed at the\nthreat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with\nthe risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5\n   Much of the concern centered around vaccines against\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were\nblamed for children\u2019s disabilities and developmental de\nlays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort\nlitigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine\nproduct-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur\ners, by the mid-1980\u2019s the suits numbered more than 200\neach year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,\ncausing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with\ndraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato\nries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its\nannual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose\nwhen Lederle had production problems in 1984.8\n   Despite the large number of suits, there were many\ncomplaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate\nvaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 See Mortimer, Immunization Against Infectious Disease, 200 Sci\n\nence 902, 906 (1978).\n   5 See National Vaccine Advisory Committee, A Comprehensive Re\n\nview of Federal Vaccine Safety Programs and Public Health Activities\n2\u20133 (Dec. 2008) (hereinafter NVAC), http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/\ndocuments/vaccine-safety-review.pdf (as visited Feb. 18, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   6 See Sing & Willian, Supplying Vaccines: An Overview of the Market\n\nand Regulatory Context, in Supplying Vaccines: An Economic Analysis\nof Critical Issues 45, 51\u201352 (M.

The Act estab\nlishes a no-fault compensation program \u201cdesigned to work\nfaster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.\u201d\nShalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U. S. 268, 269 (1995). A per\nson injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a\npetition for compensation in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services as the respondent.13 A special master\nthen makes an informal adjudication of the petition within\n(except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.14 The Court\nof Federal Claims must review objections to the special\nmaster\u2019s decision and enter final judgment under a simi\nlarly tight statutory deadline.15 At that point, a claimant\nhas two options: to accept the court\u2019s judgment and forgo a\ntraditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment\nand seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.16\n   Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act\u2019s\nVaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered\nunder the Act; describes each vaccine\u2019s compensable,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLawsuits, and Legal Rights: The Battle over Litigation in American\nSociety 146 (2002).\n  10 Mortimer, supra, at 906.\n  11 See Hagan, 45 Food Drug Cosm.

The Act\nrequires claimants to seek relief through the compensation\nprogram before filing suit for more than $1,000.24 Manu\nfacturers are generally immunized from liability for fail\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See \u00a7300aa\u201314(a); 42 CFR \u00a7100.3 (2009) (current Vaccine Injury\n\nTable).\n  18 See 42 U.

It first received federal\napproval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in\n1953 and 1970. Respondent Wyeth purchased Lederle in\n1994 and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in 1998.\n  Hannah Bruesewitz was born on October 20, 1991. Her\npediatrician administered doses of the DTP vaccine ac\ncording to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s recommended\nchildhood immunization schedule. Within 24 hours of her\nApril 1992 vaccination, Hannah started to experience\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   25 See \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(2), (c).

The Bruesewitzes\nelected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October\n2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their\ncomplaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design\nof Lederle\u2019s DTP vaccine caused Hannah\u2019s disabilities, and\nthat Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for\nnegligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31\n   Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which\ngranted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability\nand negligence design-defect claims, holding that the\nPennsylvania law providing those causes of action was\npreempted by 42 U.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine\nmanufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con\nsidered \u201cunavoidable\u201d under the statute. Provided that\nthere was proper manufacture and warning, any remain\ning side effects, including those resulting from design\ndefects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law\ndesign-defect claims are therefore preempted.\n   If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a\ndifferent design, the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d would do no\nwork. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been\navoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element. The language of the\nprovision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a\ngiven, not subject to question in the tort action. What the\nstatute establishes as a complete defense must be un\navoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with\nrespect to the particular design. Which plainly implies\nthat the design itself is not open to question.35\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34 42U. S.

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   A further textual indication leads to the same conclu\nsion. Products-liability law establishes a classic and well\nknown triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective\nmanufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and\ndefective design.36 If all three were intended to be pre\nserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only\ntwo, and leave the third to implication. It would have\nbeen much easier (and much more natural) to provide that\nmanufacturers would be liable for \u201cdefective manufacture,\ndefective directions or warning, and defective design.\u201d It\nseems that the statute fails to mention design-defect\nliability \u201cby deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\u201d Barn\nhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003). Ex\npressio unius, exclusio alterius.\n                              B\n  The dissent\u2019s principal textual argument is mistaken.\nWe agree with its premise that \u201c \u2018side effects that were\nunavoidable\u2019 must refer to side effects caused by a vac\ncine\u2019s design.\u201d37 We do not comprehend, however, the\nsecond step of its reasoning, which is that the use of\nthe conditional term \u201cif\u201d in the introductory phrase \u201cif the\ninjury or death resulted from side effects that were un\navoidable\u201d \u201cplainly implies that some side effects stem\nming from a vaccine\u2019s design are \u2018unavoidable,\u2019 while\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWe doubt that Congress would introduce such an amorphous test by\nimplication when it otherwise micromanages vaccine manufacturers.\nSee infra, at 13\u201314. We have no idea how much more expensive an\nalternative design can be before it \u201ccompromis[es]\u201d a vaccine\u2019s cost or\nhow much efficacy an alternative design can sacrifice to improve safety.\nNeither does the dissent. And neither will the judges who must rule on\nmotions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and motions for\njudgment as a matter of law. Which means that the test would proba\nbly have no real-world effect.\n  36 W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

The \u201cif \u201d clause\nmakes total sense whether the design to which \u201cunavoid\nable\u201d refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design\n(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine\nat issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design\nused for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un\navoidable). Under the latter view, the condition estab\nlished by the \u201cif\u201d clause is that the vaccine have been\nproperly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,\nthat it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac\ntured. Neither view renders the \u201cif \u201d clause a nullity.\nWhich of the two variants must be preferred is addressed\nby our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by\nthe \u201cif \u201d clause.\n   Petitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s textual argument also\nrests upon the proposition that the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com\nment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A (1963\u2013\n1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer\nstrictly liable for harm to person or property caused by\n\u201cany product in a defective condition unreasonably dan\ngerous to the user.\u201d40 Comment k exempts from this\nstrict-liability rule \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d An\nunavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of\ncriteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies\nvaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this\nlack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the\ncomment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of\ncourts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an\n\u201cunavoidably unsafe product\u201d: a case-specific showing that\nthe product was \u201cquite incapable of being made safer for\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 38 Ibid.\n 39 See   Brief for Petitioners 29.\n\n 40 Restatement     \u00a7402A, p. 347. \n\n10                   BRUESEWITZ v.

Whatever consistent judicial gloss that comment may\nhave been given in 1986, there is no reason to believe that\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) was invoking it. The comment creates a\nspecial category of \u201cunavoidably unsafe products,\u201d while\nthe statute refers to \u201cside effects that were unavoidable.\u201d\nThat the latter uses the adjective \u201cunavoidable\u201d and the\nformer the adverb \u201cunavoidably\u201d does not establish that\nCongress had comment k in mind. \u201cUnavoidable\u201d is\nhardly a rarely used word. Even the cases petitioners cite\nas putting a definitive gloss on comment k use the precise\nphrase \u201cunavoidably unsafe product\u201d;42 none attaches\nspecial significance to the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d standing\nalone.\n   The textual problems with petitioners\u2019 interpretation do\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  41 Id., Comment k, p. 353; Petitioners cite, inter alia, Kearl v.

The phrase \u201ceven though\u201d in the clause\n\u201ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and\n[labeled]\u201d is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable\nside effects persist despite best manufacturing and label\ning practices.43 But petitioners\u2019 reading eliminates any\nopposition between the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014called a\nconcessive subordinate clause by grammarians\u2014and the\nword \u201cunavoidable.\u201d44 Their reading makes preemption\nturn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and\nproper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the\nrequirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as\n\u201ctwo additional prerequisites\u201d for preemption independent\nof unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for\nthe dissent\u2019s position depends on that independence.46\nBut linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating\njunction like \u201cand,\u201d not a subordinating junction like \u201ceven\nthough.\u201d47\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  43 The dissent\u2019s assertion that we treat \u201ceven though\u201d as a synonym\n\nfor \u201cbecause\u201d misses the subtle distinction between \u201cbecause\u201d and\n\u201cdespite.\u201d See post, at 17, n. 14. \u201cEven though\u201d is a close cousin of the\nlatter. See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.\n1957). The statement \u201cthe car accident was unavoidable despite his\nquick reflexes\u201d indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci\ndent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un\nstated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,\nbut came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only\npossible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of \u00a7300aa\u2013\n22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this\ncontext. (Incidentally, the statement \u201cthe car accident was unavoidable\nbecause of his quick reflexes\u201d makes no sense.)\n  44 See W. Follett, Modern American Usage: A Guide 61 (1966).\n  45 Post, at 9, 17.\n  46 Post, at 3\u20135.\n  47 The dissent responds that these \u201cadditional prerequisites\u201d act \u201cin a\n\nconcessive, subordinating fashion,\u201d post, at 17, n. 14 (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But that is no more true of the dissent\u2019s\nconjunctive interpretation of the present text than it is of all provisions\nthat set forth additional requirements\u2014meaning that we could elimi\nnate \u201ceven though\u201d from our English lexicon, its function being entirely\n12                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpreta\ntion we propose would render part of \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\nsuperfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more\nclearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability\n\u201cif . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accom\npanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d The interven\ning passage (\u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects\nthat were unavoidable even though\u201d) is unnecessary. True\nenough. But the rule against giving a portion of text an\ninterpretation which renders it superfluous does not pre\nscribe that a passage which could have been more terse\ndoes not mean what it says. The rule applies only if ver\nbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend\ning passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing\ninterpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,\npetitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s interpretation gives inde\npendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed\nmeaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense\nof rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.\nSince a vaccine is not \u201cquite incapable of being made safer\nfor [its] intended use\u201d if manufacturing defects could have\nbeen eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire\n\u201ceven though\u201d clause is a useless appendage.49 It would\nsuffice to say \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side\neffects that were unavoidable\u201d\u2014full stop.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nperformed by \u201cand.\u201d No, we think \u201ceven though\u201d has a distinctive\nconcessive, subordinating role to play.\n  48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli\n\nance on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), is mis\nplaced. See id., at 449 (adopting an interpretation that was \u201cthe only\none that makes sense of each phrase\u201d in the relevant statute).\n  49 That is true regardless of whether \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) incorporates\n\ncomment k. See Restatement \u00a7402A, Comment k, pp. 353, 354 (noting\nthat \u201cunavoidably unsafe products\u201d are exempt from strict liability\n\u201cwith the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,\nand proper warning is given\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

A vaccine\u2019s license spells out the manufacturing\nmethod that must be followed and the directions and\nwarnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac\nturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini\nstration\u2019s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De\nviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of\nmanufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further\nobjective evidence comes from the FDA\u2019s regulations\u2014\nmore than 90 of them52\u2014that pervasively regulate the\nmanufacturing process, down to the requirements for\nplumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing\nfacility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,\nor with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac\nturer its regulatory-compliance defense.54\n   Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men\ntion in the NCVIA or the FDA\u2019s regulations. Indeed, the\nFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria\nit uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for\nits intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy\none. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less\nefficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not\nalways the best one. Striking the right balance between\nsafety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to\nvaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.\nYet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages\nmanufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing\ndesigns.

WYETH LLC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nploy an alternative design that the FDA has approved for\ndistribution (an approval it takes years to obtain56)? Or\ndoes it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in\nother countries? Or could there be liability for failure to\nuse a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor\nthe FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni\nverse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex\npert\u2019s imagination.\n   Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with\nlittle guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence\nof guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of\nguidance for design defects combined with the exten-\nsive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically\nmentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects\nwere not mentioned because they are not a basis for\nliability.\n   The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same\nconclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have\ntwo beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of\nimproved designs, and (2) providing compensation for\ninflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for\nachieving both effects. We have already discussed the\nAct\u2019s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro\nvides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote\n\u201cthe development of childhood vaccines that result in\nfewer and less serious adverse reactions.\u201d57 It establishes\na National Vaccine Program, whose Director is \u201cto achieve\noptimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to\nachieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.\u201d58\nThe Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re\nsearch, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 56 See Sing & William, Supplying Vaccines, at 66\u201367.\n 57 42 U.

It instead\nreflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological\njudgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na\ntional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63\n   And finally, the Act\u2019s structural quid pro quo leads to\nthe same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund\nfrom their sales an informal, efficient compensation pro\ngram for vaccine injuries;64 in exchange they avoid costly\ntort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury\nverdict.65 But design-defect allegations are the most\nspeculative and difficult type of products liability claim to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  59 See \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u20132(a)(1)\u2013(3), 300aa\u20133.\n  60 See \u00a7300aa\u201325(b).\n  61 See NVAC 18\u201319.\n  62 See 21 CFR \u00a7601.5(b)(1)(vi) (2010).\n  63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that\n\nwe believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in\nthat fashion.

Taxing vaccine manufacturers\u2019 product to fund\nthe compensation program, while leaving their liability for\ndesign defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax\nmanufacturers back into the market.\n   The dissent believes the Act\u2019s mandates are irrelevant\nbecause they do not spur innovation in precisely the same\nway as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges\ntion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that\nCongress would quietly preempt product-liability claims\nwithout providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.\nv. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486\u2013488 (1996) (plurality opinion),\nwe have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp\ntion unless the congressional substitute operated like the\ntort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The\ndissent\u2019s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine\nProgram cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is\nprobably questionable, but surely beside the point.\n                              IV\n  Since our interpretation of \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) is the only\ninterpretation supported by the text and structure of the\nNCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is\na legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need\nto resort to it. In any case, the dissent\u2019s contention that it\nwould contradict our conclusion is mistaken.\n  The dissent\u2019s legislative history relies on the following\nsyllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) \u201csets forth the principle contained in\nComment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts\n(Second);\u201d67 in 1986 comment k was \u201ccommonly under\nstood\u201d to require a case-specific showing that \u201cno feasible\nalternative design\u201d existed; Congress therefore must have\nintended \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 66 See post, at 21\u201324. \n\n 67 H.R.

Because the Report believes that \u00a7300aa\u2013\n22(b)(1) should incorporate \u201cthe principle in Comment K\u201d\nand because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen\nsation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who\ncannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to \u201cpursue\nrecompense in the compensation system, not the tort\nsystem.\u201d71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1).\n   Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by\na later Congress \u201cauthoritative[ly]\u201d vindicates its interpre\ntation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic\ntion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre\ntation. See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  69 1986   Report, at 26; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if the defendant manufacturer\nmay have made as safe a vaccine as anyone reasonably could expect, a\ncourt or jury undoubtedly will find it difficult to rule in favor of the\n\u2018innocent\u2019 manufacturer if the equally \u2018innocent\u2019 child has to bear the\nrisk of loss with no other possibility of recompense\u201d).\n   70 Ibid.\n   71 Ibid.\n   72 Post, at 12. This is a courageous adverb since we have previously\n\nheld that the only authoritative source of statutory meaning is the text\nthat has passed through the Article I process. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v.\nAllapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005).\n18                 BRUESEWITZ v.

Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is\npersuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on\nwhat legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text\nto mean when they voted to enact it into law. See Exxon\nMobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568\n(2005). But post-enactment legislative history by defini\ntion \u201ccould have had no effect on the congressional vote,\u201d\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).\n   It does not matter that \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) did not take\neffect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that\nfunds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly\ndispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding\nlegislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory\nlanguage were not necessarily the same persons who\ncrafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if\nthey were did not necessarily have the same views at that\nearlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could\npossibly have been informed by those later statements.\nPermitting the legislative history of subsequent funding\nlegislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a\ndangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law\ndepend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75\nthey cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory\nrevision.\n   That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent\u2019s syllo\ngism: Comment k did not have a \u201ccommonly understood\nmeaning\u201d76 in the mid-1980\u2019s. Some courts thought it\nrequired a case-specific showing that a product was \u201cun\navoidably unsafe\u201d; many others thought it categorically\nexempted certain types of products from strict liability.77\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  73 Pub.

See Garcia v. United States,\n469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\u201c[T]he authoritative source for\nfinding the Legislature\u2019s intent lies in the Committee\nReports on the bill\u201d).

R.\n    Rep.).\nThe Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the\nclause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manu\nfacturing and improper labeling), while going on to state\nthat compensation for other tort claims, e.g., design-defect\nclaims, lies in \u201cthe [NCVIA\u2019s no-fault] compensation sys\ntem, not the tort system.\u201d Ibid.\n   The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Re\nport\u2019s earlier description of the statute as \u201cset[ting] forth\nthe principle contained in Comment k\u201d (of the Restate\nment Second of Torts\u2019 strict liability section, 402A) that \u201ca\nvaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or\ndeaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.\u201d Id., at 23\n(emphasis added). But the appearance of the word \u201cun\navoidable\u201d in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide\npetitioners with much help. That is because nothing in\nthe Report suggests that the statute means the word\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d to summon up an otherwise unmentioned\nthird exception encompassing suits based on design de\nfects. Nor can the Report\u2019s reference to comment k fill the\ngap. The Report itself refers, not to comment k\u2019s details,\nbut only to its \u201cprinciple,\u201d namely, that vaccine manufac\nturers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.\nIt says nothing at all about who\u2014judge, jury, or federal\nsafety agency\u2014should decide whether a safer vaccine\ncould have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress\nwrote this Report, different state courts had come to very\ndifferent conclusions about that matter.

In holding that \u00a722(b)(1) of the National\nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act),\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1), pre-empts all design defect\nclaims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under\nthe Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference\nover the considered judgment of Congress. In doing so,\nthe Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, mis\nconstrues the Act\u2019s legislative history, and disturbs the\ncareful balance Congress struck between compensating\nvaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood\nvaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum\nin which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers ade\nquately take account of scientific and technological ad\nvancements when designing or distributing their products.\nBecause nothing in the text, structure, or legislative his\ntory of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress\nintended such a result, I respectfully dissent.\n2                  BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Section 22 of the Vaccine Act provides \u201c[s]tandards of\nresponsibility\u201d to govern civil actions against vaccine\nmanufacturers. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322. Section 22(a) sets\nforth the \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d that \u201cState law shall apply to a\ncivil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related\ninjury or death.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201322(a). This baseline rule that\nstate law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one\nof which, \u00a722(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)\nprovides:\n    \u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury\n    or death associated with the administration of a vac\n    cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re\n    sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\n    though the vaccine was properly prepared and was\n    accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d\n    \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1).\nThe provision contains two key clauses: \u201cif the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u201d\n(the \u201cif \u201d clause), and \u201ceven though the vaccine was prop\nerly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions\nand warnings\u201d (the \u201ceven though\u201d clause).\n   Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes\nthree different types of product defects: design defects,\nmanufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to\nwarn).1 The reference in the \u201ceven though\u201d clause to a\n\u201cproperly prepared\u201d vaccine \u201caccompanied by proper direc\ntions and warnings\u201d is an obvious reference to two such\ndefects\u2014manufacturing and labeling defects. The plain\nterms of the \u201ceven though\u201d clause thus indicate that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

Because \u00a722(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur\ners as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each\ncivil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from\nmanufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the\nliability exemption of \u00a722(b)(1).2\n   Given that the \u201ceven though\u201d clause requires the ab\nsence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the \u201cif \u201d\nclause\u2019s reference to \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d\nmust refer to side effects caused by something other than\nmanufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining\nkind of product defect recognized under traditional prod\nucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, \u201cside effects\nthat were unavoidable\u201d must refer to side effects caused by\na vaccine\u2019s design that were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d Because\n\u00a722(b)(1) uses the conditional term \u201cif,\u201d moreover, the text\nplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a\nvaccine\u2019s design are \u201cunavoidable,\u201d while others are avoid\nable. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1124 (2002) (\u201cif \u201d means \u201cin the event that,\u201d \u201cso long as,\u201d or\n\u201con condition that\u201d). Accordingly, because the \u201cif \u201d clause\n(like the \u201ceven though\u201d clause) sets forth a condition to\ninvoke \u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s defense to tort liability, Congress must\nalso have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate\nin each civil action that the particular side effects of a\nvaccine\u2019s design were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d\n   Congress\u2019 use of conditional \u201cif\u201d clauses in two other\nprovisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that\n\u00a722(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a\nmanufacturer seeks to invoke the provision\u2019s exception to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 See Silkwood v.

In \u00a722(b)(2), Congress created a pre\nsumption that, for purposes of \u00a722(b)(1), \u201ca vaccine shall\nbe presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and\nwarnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it com\nplied in all material respects with\u201d federal labeling re\nquirements. 42 U.

Similarly, in\n\u00a723(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive\ndamages \u201c[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied,\nin all material respects,\u201d with applicable federal laws,\nunless it engages in \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cintentional and wrongful\nwithholding of information\u201d from federal regulators, or\n\u201cother criminal or illegal activity.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201323(d)(2). It\nwould be highly anomalous for Congress to use a condi\ntional \u201cif \u201d clause in \u00a7\u00a722(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a\nspecific inquiry in each case while using the same condi\ntional \u201cif \u201d clause in \u00a722(b)(1) to denote a categorical ex\nemption from liability. Cf. Erlenbaugh v. United States,\n409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972) (\u201c[A] legislative body generally\nuses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a\ngiven context\u201d).\n   Indeed, when Congress intends to pre-empt design\ndefect claims categorically, it does so using categorical\n(e.g., \u201call\u201d) and/or declarative language (e.g., \u201cshall\u201d),\nrather than a conditional term (\u201cif \u201d). For example, in\na related context, Congress has authorized the Secretary\nof Health and Human Services to designate a vaccine\ndesigned to prevent a pandemic or epidemic as a \u201ccovered\ncountermeasure.\u201d         42 U.

Contrary to the majority\u2019s\nand respondent\u2019s categorical reading, petitioners correctly\ncontend that, where a plaintiff has proved that she has\nsuffered an injury resulting from a side effect caused by\na vaccine\u2019s design, a vaccine manufacturer may invoke\n\u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s liability exemption only if it demonstrates that\nthe side effect stemming from the particular vaccine\u2019s\ndesign is \u201cunavoidable,\u201d and that the vaccine is otherwise\nfree from manufacturing and labeling defects.3\n                             B\n   The legislative history confirms petitioners\u2019 interpreta\ntion of \u00a722(b)(1) and sheds further light on its pre-emptive\nscope. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport accompanying the Vaccine Act, H. R. Rep.

There are some products which, in\nthe present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being\nmade safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially\ncommon in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine\nfor the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to\nvery serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the\ndisease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing\nand the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the\nunavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product,\nproperly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning,\nis not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of\nmany other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very\nreason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the pre\nscription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or\nexperimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity\nfor sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or\nperhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is\njustifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically\nrecognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualifica\ntion that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning\nis given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict\nliability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely\nbecause he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently\nuseful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently\nreasonable risk.\u201d Restatement 353\u2013354.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

That intent, in turn, is manifested in the plain\ntext of \u00a722(b)(1)\u2014in particular, Congress\u2019 use of the word\n\u201cunavoidable,\u201d as well as the phrases \u201cproperly prepared\u201d\nand \u201caccompanied by proper directions and warnings,\u201d\nwhich were taken nearly verbatim from comment k. 42\nU.

By the time of the Vaccine Act\u2019s enactment in\n1986, numerous state and federal courts had interpreted\ncomment k to mean that a product is \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d\nwhen, given proper manufacture and labeling, no feasible\nalternative design would reduce the safety risks without\ncompromising the product\u2019s cost and utility.5 Given Con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 See, e.g., Smith ex rel.

When Con\ngress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially\ninclude a source of payment for the no-fault compensation\nprogram the Act established.

The concurrence makes a similar\nargument. Ante, at 1\u20132 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation\nfinds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that \u201cif [injured\nindividuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a\nvaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im\nproper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom\npense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\u201d 1986 Report\n26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which\nreflected considerable disagreement in the courts over \u201cwhether com\nment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on\na case-by-case basis.\u201d Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and\nStrict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the\nSellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11\n(1989\u20131990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under\nmined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines\nfor optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20\u201322, and n. 19, and thus it\nseems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi\ntional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu\nlarly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity\nas to how precisely Congress intended the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\u201d to\napply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in\npetitioners\u2019 favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport, H.

In 1987, Con\ngress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro\ngram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated\nthat \u201cthe codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement\n(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of\nlaw the circumstances in which a vaccine should be\ndeemed unavoidably unsafe.\u201d Id., at 691. The Committee\nnoted that \u201c[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manu\nfacturer\u2019s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not\ngrounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during\nits original consideration of the Act.\u201d Ibid. In light of that\nrejection, the Committee emphasized that \u201cthere should be\nno misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a\nmatter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe\nor not,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his question is left to the courts to\ndetermine in accordance with applicable law.\u201d Ibid.\n   To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by\na subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis\nfrom which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.\nSee Sullivan v.

But unlike ordinary\npostenactment legislative history, which is justifiably\ngiven little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the\nintent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation\nnecessary to give operative effect to the principal provi\nsions of the Vaccine Act, including \u00a722(b)(1).10 Congress in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion below expressed uncertainty as to\n\nwhether the 1987 Report was authored by the House Budget Commit\ntee or the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Because the tort reforms in the 1986\nAct, including \u00a722(b)(1), had no operative legal effect\nunless and until Congress provided funding for the com\npensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted\nthat funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authori\ntative guide to the meaning of \u00a722(b)(1). Those views, as\nreflected in the 1987 Report, provide unequivocal confir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ning mechanism is akin to appropriations legislation and that giving\nweight to the legislative history of such legislation \u201cwould set a danger\nous precedent.\u201d Ante, at 18. The difference, of course, is that appro\npriations legislation ordinarily funds congressional enactments that\nalready have operative legal effect; in contrast, operation of the tort\nreforms in the 1986 Act, including \u00a722(b)(1), was expressly conditioned\non the enactment of a separate tax to fund the compensation program.\nSee \u00a7323(a), 100 Stat. 3784. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s general reluc\ntance to view appropriations legislation as modifying substantive\nlegislation, see, e.g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U.

Accordingly, I believe \u00a722(b)(1) exempts\nvaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a\nshowing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine\nwas properly manufactured and labeled, and that the side\neffects stemming from the vaccine\u2019s design could not have\nbeen prevented by a feasible alternative design that would\nhave eliminated the adverse side effects without compro\nmising the vaccine\u2019s cost and utility.\n                             II\n  In contrast to the interpretation of \u00a722(b)(1) set forth\nabove, the majority\u2019s interpretation does considerable vio\nlence to the statutory text, misconstrues the legislative\nhistory, and draws the wrong conclusions from the struc\nture of the Vaccine Act and the broader federal scheme\nregulating vaccines.\n                             A\n   As a textual matter, the majority\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a722(b)(1) is fundamentally flawed in three central re\nspects. First, the majority\u2019s categorical reading rests on a\nfaulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading func\ntionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including\nthe key term \u201cunavoidable.\u201d And third, the majority en\ntirely ignores the Vaccine Act\u2019s default rule preserving\nstate tort law.\n   To begin, the majority states that \u201c[a] side effect of a\nvaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a\ndifferently designed vaccine not containing the harmful\nelement.\u201d Ante, at 7. From that premise, the majority\nconcludes that the statute must mean that \u201cthe design of\nthe vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort\naction,\u201d because construing the statute otherwise would\n14                 BRUESEWITZ v.

A tort claimant, accord\ning to the majority, will always be able to point to a differ\nently designed vaccine not containing the \u201charmful ele\nment,\u201d and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine\u2019s\nside effects were not \u201cunavoidable,\u201d the statute would pre\nempt nothing.\n   The starting premise of the majority\u2019s interpretation,\nhowever, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal\nsense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be\navoided \u201cby use of a differently designed vaccine not con\ntaining the harmful element,\u201d ibid., this interpretation of\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d would effectively read the term out of the\nstatute, and Congress could not have intended that result.\nIndeed, \u00a722(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase\n\u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were\nunavoidable,\u201d which plainly indicates that Congress con\ntemplated that there would be some instances in which a\nvaccine\u2019s side effects are \u201cunavoidable\u201d and other in\nstances in which they are not. See supra, at 3. The major\nity\u2019s premise that a vaccine\u2019s side effects can always be\n\u201cavoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element,\u201d ante, at 7, entirely ig\nnores the fact that removing the \u201charmful element\u201d will\noften result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective)\nvaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a\nkilled or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate\nantibody production;13 removing that bacteria or virus\nmight remove the \u201charmful element,\u201d but it would also\nnecessarily render the vaccine inert. As explained above,\nthe legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases\ninterpreting comment k make clear that a side effect is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 SeeAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Questions and Answers about\nVaccine Ingredients (Oct. 2008), http://www.aap.org/immunization/\nfamilies/faq/Vaccineingredients.pdf (all Internet materials as visited\nFeb. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

See supra, at 7. The majority\u2019s premise\u2014that\nside effects stemming from a vaccine\u2019s design are always\navoidable\u2014is thus belied by the statutory text and legisla\ntive history of \u00a722(b)(1). And because its starting premise\nis invalid, its conclusion\u2014that the design of a vaccine is\nnot subject to challenge in a tort action\u2014is also necessar\nily invalid.\n    The majority\u2019s reading suffers from an even more fun\ndamental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine\nmanufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil\nity, it more logically would have provided: \u201cNo vaccine\nmanufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages\narising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated\nwith the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,\nif the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\nby proper directions and warnings.\u201d There would have\nbeen no need for Congress to include the additional 13\nwords \u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that\nwere unavoidable even though.\u201d See TRW Inc. v.

See\nante, at 12 (\u201cThe intervening passage (\u2018the injury or death\nresulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\nthough\u2019) is unnecessary. True enough\u201d). Nevertheless, the\nmajority contends that \u201cthe rule against giving a portion of\ntext an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . .\napplies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by\ngiving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text,\na competing interpretation.\u201d Ibid. According to the major\nity, petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a722(b)(1) renders the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners\u2019\ndesired outcome, \u201c[i]t would suffice to say \u2018if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u2019\u2014\nfull stop.\u201d Ibid. As explained above, however, the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause establishes two additional prerequisites\u2014\nproper manufacturing and proper labeling\u2014to qualify for\n\u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s exemption from liability. Contrary to the ma\njority\u2019s contention, then, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause serves\nan important function by limiting the scope of the pre\nemption afforded by the preceding \u201cif \u201d clause.14\n   The majority\u2019s only other textual argument is based on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 In this manner, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause functions in a \u201cconcessive\n\nsubordinat[ing]\u201d fashion, ante, at 11, in accord with normal grammati\ncal usage. According to the majority, however, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\n\u201cclarifies the word that precedes it\u201d by \u201cdelineat[ing]\u201d the conditions\nthat make a side effect \u201cunavoidable\u201d under the statute. Ante, at 7.\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation hardly treats the clause as \u201cconcessive,\u201d\nand indeed strains the meaning of \u201ceven though.\u201d In the majority\u2019s\nview, proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that\nrender a vaccine\u2019s side effects unavoidable. Thus, an injurious side\neffect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and\nlabeled, not \u201ceven though\u201d it was. The two conjunctions are not equiva\nlent: The sentence \u201cI am happy even though it is raining\u201d can hardly be\nread to mean that \u201cI am happy because it is raining.\u201d In any event, the\nmore fundamental point is that petitioners\u2019 interpretation actually\ngives meaning to the words \u201ceven though,\u201d whereas the majority\nconcedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely\nout of the statute. See supra this page.\n18                   BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon. According to\nthe majority, because blackletter products liability law\ngenerally recognizes three different types of product de\nfects, \u201c[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would\nbe strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only\ntwo\u201d\u2014namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the\n\u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014\u201cand leave the third to implication.\u201d\nAnte, at 8. The majority\u2019s argument, however, ignores\nthat the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state\nlaw is preserved. As explained above, \u00a722(a) expressly\nprovides that the \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d is that \u201cState law shall\napply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine\nrelated injury or death.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(a). Be\ncause \u00a722(a) already preserves state-law design defect\nclaims (to the extent the exemption in \u00a722(b)(1) does not\napply), there was no need for Congress separately and\nexpressly to preserve design defect claims in \u00a722(b)(1).\nIndeed, Congress\u2019 principal aim in enacting \u00a722(b)(1) was\nnot to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those,\ntoo, were already preserved by \u00a722(a)), but rather, to\nfederalize comment k-type protection for \u201cunavoidably\nunsafe\u201d vaccines. The \u201ceven though\u201d clause simply func\ntions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of\nexpress language in \u00a722(b)(1) specifically preserving de\nsign defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as\nimpliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional\nstate tort claims, which had already been preserved by\n\u00a722(a).15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 This Court, moreover, has long operated on \u201cthe assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the\nFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.\u201d Altria Group, Inc. v.

Putting aside the fact that \u00a722(a) already preserves\ndesign defect claims (to the extent \u00a722(b)(1) does not ap\nply), the majority\u2019s proposed solution would not have fully\neffectuated Congress\u2019 intent. As the legislative history\nmakes clear, Congress used the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d to\neffectuate its intent that the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\nregarding \u2018unavoidably unsafe\u2019 products . . . apply to the\nvaccines covered in the bill.\u201d 1986 Report 26; see also\n1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act\u2019s enact\nment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected\ncomment k,16 while many others had not addressed the\napplicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap\nplied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory\nother than strict liability (e.g., negligence17). A statute\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nan express saving clause in the same statutory section, see 42 U. S.

The principal thrust of the majority\u2019s\nposition is that, since nothing in the Vaccine Act or the\nFDA\u2019s regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions\ndesign defects, Congress must have intended to remove\nissues concerning the design of FDA-licensed vaccines\nfrom the tort system. Ante, at 13. The flaw in that rea\nsoning, of course, is that the FDA\u2019s silence on design de\nfects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.\nIndeed, the majority itself concedes that the \u201cFDA has\nnever even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to\ndecide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its in\ntended use.\u201d18 Ibid. And yet it is undisputed that prior to\nthe Act, vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to\nliability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.\nThat the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehen\nsive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is\nthus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly\ndecided to change course sub silentio and pre-empt a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnegligence\u201d); Toner, 112 Idaho, at 340, 732 P. 2d, at 309\u2013310 (\u201cThe\nauthorities universally agree that where a product is deemed unavoid\nably unsafe, the plaintiff is deprived of the advantage of a strict liabil\nity cause of action, but may proceed under a negligence cause of ac\ntion\u201d).\n   18 See 42 U.

See 1987\nReport 691 (\u201cIt is not the Committee\u2019s intention to pre\nclude court actions under applicable law. The Commit\ntee\u2019s intent at the time of considering the Act . . . was . . .\nto leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as\nexpressly altered by the Act\u201d).\n  The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily\nintended to pre-empt design defect claims since the aim of\nsuch tort suits is to promote the development of improved\ndesigns and provide compensation for injured individuals,\nand the Vaccine Act \u201cprovides other means for achieving\nboth effects\u201d\u2014most notably through the no-fault compen\nsation program and the National Vaccine Program.

But\nthe majority\u2019s position elides a significant difference be\ntween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.\nAlthough the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services with the obligation to \u201cpromote the\ndevelopment of childhood vaccines\u201d and \u201cmake or assure\nimprovements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,\u201d\n\u00a7300aa\u201327(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of\nfederal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers\nto improve the design of their vaccines to account for\nscientific and technological advances.

The regulation does not authorize the FDA to revoke a\nbiologics license for a manufacturer\u2019s failure to adopt an optimal\nvaccine design in light of existing science and technology. See Conk, Is\nThere a Design Defect in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products\nLiability? 109 Yale L.

The normal competitive\nforces that spur innovation and improvements to existing\nproduct lines in other markets thus operate with less force\nin the vaccine market, particularly for vaccines that have\nalready been released and marketed to the public. Absent\na clear statutory mandate to the contrary, there is no\nreason to think that Congress intended in the vaccine\ncontext to eliminate the traditional incentive and deter\nrence functions served by state tort liability in favor of a\nfederal regulatory scheme providing only carrots and no\nsticks.21 See Levine, 555 U.

Congress could, of course,\nadopt a regulatory regime that operates differently from state tort\nsystems, and such a difference is not necessarily a reason to question\nCongress\u2019 pre-emptive intent. In the specific context of the Vaccine Act,\nhowever, the relevant point is that this Court should not lightly assume\n24                  BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncase for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where\nCongress has indicated its awareness of the operation of\nstate law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless\ndecided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever\ntension there is between them.\u201d (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted)).\n                             III\n  In enacting the Vaccine Act, Congress established a\ncarefully wrought federal scheme that balances the com\npeting interests of vaccine-injured persons and vaccine\nmanufacturers. As the legislative history indicates, the\nAct addressed \u201ctwo overriding concerns\u201d: \u201c(a) the inade\nquacy\u2014from both the perspective of vaccine-injured per\nsons as well as vaccine manufacturers\u2014of the current\napproach to compensating those who have been damaged\nby a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of\nthe childhood vaccine market.\u201d 1986 Report 7. When\nviewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole,\n\u00a722(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme\nthat balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured\nchildren with added liability protections for vaccine manu\nfacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.\n  The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of\nthe no-fault compensation program\u2014a scheme funded\nentirely through an excise tax on vaccines.22 Through that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to displace a longstanding species\nof state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an\nexpress saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of\nstate-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law\nwould leave an important regulatory function\u2014i.e., ensuring optimal\nvaccine design\u2014entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.\n  22 The majority\u2019s suggestion that \u201cvaccine manufacturers fund from\n\ntheir sales\u201d the compensation program is misleading.

The structure and legislative history,\nmoreover, point clearly to Congress\u2019 intention to divert\nwould-be tort claimants into the compensation program,\nrather than eliminate a longstanding category of tradi\ntional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (\u201cThe Committee\nanticipates that the speed of the compensation program,\nthe low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault na\nture of the required findings, and the relative certainty\nand generosity of the system\u2019s awards will divert a signifi\ncant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation\u201d). In\ndeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would\nhave eliminated the principal source of the \u201cunpredictabil\nity\u201d in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose not\nto pre-empt state tort claims categorically. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(a) (providing as a \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d that \u201cState\nlaw shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a\nvaccine-related injury or death\u201d). That decision reflects\nCongress\u2019 recognition that court actions are essential\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvaccines/programs/vfc/cdc-vac-price-list.htm. Accordingly, the only way\nthe vaccine manufacturers can be said to actually \u201cfund\u201d the compensa\ntion program is if the cost of the excise tax has an impact on the num\nber of vaccines sold by the vaccine manufacturer. The majority points\nto no evidence that the excise tax\u2014which ordinarily amounts to 75\ncents per dose, 26 U. S. C. \u00a74131(b)\u2014has any impact whatsoever on the\ndemand for vaccines.\n   23 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (\u201cDepartment of\n\nJustice records indicate that 99.8% of successful Compensation Pro\ngram claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort reme\ndies against vaccine manufacturers\u201d); S.

See \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u2013\n12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3). Congress thus clearly believed there\nwas still an important function to be played by state tort\nlaw.\n   Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,\nCongress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac\nturers\u2019 liability exposure, including a limited regulatory\ncompliance presumption of adequate warnings, see\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure\nto provide direct warnings to patients, \u00a7300aa\u201322(c), a\nheightened standard for punitive damages, \u00a7300aa\u2013\n23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for \u201cun\navoidable\u201d side effects, \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1). Considered in\nlight of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s exemption\nfrom liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one\npart of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress\u2019\ncareful balance between providing adequate compensation\nfor vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial\nbenefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and\npredictable childhood vaccine supply.\n   The majority\u2019s decision today disturbs that careful\nbalance based on a bare policy preference that it is better\n\u201cto leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine\ndesign to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program\nrather than juries.\u201d Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable\nminds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries\nweigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac\ncine design.

Brief for Respondent 56\u201357. Accord\ning to respondent, a ruling that \u00a722(b)(1) does not pre-empt design\ndefect claims could unleash a \u201ccrushing wave\u201d of tort litigation that\nwould bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply.\nId., at 28. This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in\nrespondent\u2019s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring\nopinions in this case. In the absence of any empirical data, however,\nthe prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claim\nants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative. As\nan initial matter, the special masters in the autism cases have thus far\nuniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism.\nSee Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as Amici Curiae\n20\u201321, n. 4 (collecting cases). To be sure, those rulings do not necessar\nily mean that no such causal link exists, cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine\nInjury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately\nbe able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the\nadded tool of civil discovery. But these rulings do highlight the sub\nstantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See Schafer v. American\nCyanamid Co., 20 F. 3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (\u201c[A] petitioner to whom the\nVaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort\nlaw\u2019s yet more serious obstacles to recovery\u201d). Trial courts, moreover,\nhave considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of\nmeritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (in\ncluding for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led\nto shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of\nrespondent and the various amici cited by the concurrence, ante, at 6\u20137,\nthe possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufac\nturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More\nfundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the\nissue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question,\nthe text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that\nCongress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who\nhave suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The\nmajority\u2019s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress\u2019 role\nand deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Con\ngress intended them to have.\n28               BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npre-empt all design defect claims against vaccine manu\nfacturers for covered vaccines, the majority\u2019s decision\nleaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one\u2014neither the\nFDA nor any other federal agency, nor state and federal\njuries\u2014ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately\ntake account of scientific and technological advancements.\nThis concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines\nthat have already been released and marketed to the\npublic. Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competi\ntion in the vaccine market, will often have little or no\nincentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are al\nready generating significant profit margins. Nothing in\nthe text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests\nthat Congress intended that result.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

WYETH LLC, FKA WYETH, INC.,\n                      ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09\u2013152.      Argued October 12, 2010\u2014Decided February 22, 2011\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) cre\n  ated a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market\n  adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation\n  and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing le\n  gitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult. The Act\n  provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a peti\n  tion for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the\n  Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the\n  court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the\n  claimant can then decide whether to accept the court\u2019s judgment or\n  reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer. Awards\n  are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.\n  As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability pro\n  tections. Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability\n  for a vaccine\u2019s unavoidable, adverse side effects.\n     Hannah Bruesewitz\u2019s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the\n  Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled af\n  ter receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine\n  manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent\n  Wyeth). After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the\n  unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, al\n  leging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederle\u2019s DTP vaccine\n  caused Hannah\u2019s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict\n  liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania com\n  mon law. Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court. It\n  granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Penn\n  sylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1), which\n2                     BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    provides that \u201c[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death asso\n    ciated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if\n    the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable\n    even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\n    by proper directions and warnings.\u201d The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine\n manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury\n or death caused by a vaccine\u2019s side effects. Pp. 7\u201319.\n    (a) Section 300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s text suggests that a vaccine\u2019s design is\n not open to question in a tort action. If a manufacturer could be held\n liable for failure to use a different design, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\n would do no work. A vaccine side effect could always have been\n avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful\n element. The language of the provision thus suggests the design is\n not subject to question in a tort action. What the statute establishes\n as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufac\n ture and warning) with respect to the particular design. This conclu\n sion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law es\n tablishes three grounds for liability\u2014defective manufacture,\n inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design\u2014the Act\n mentions only manufacture and warnings. It thus seems that the\n Act\u2019s failure to mention design-defect liability is \u201cby deliberate choice,\n not inadvertence.\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.\n Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument, there is no reason to believe\n that \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s term \u201cunavoidable\u201d is a term of art incorporat\n ing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A, Comment k, which exempts\n from strict liability rules \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d \u201cUnavoid\n able\u201d is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k\n attach special significance only to the term \u201cunavoidably unsafe\n products,\u201d not the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d standing alone. Moreover,\n reading the phrase \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d to exempt in\n juries caused by flawed design would require treating \u201ceven though\u201d\n as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a\n concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause\n weakens or qualifies the other. The canon against superfluity does\n not undermine this Court\u2019s interpretation because petitioners\u2019 com\n peting interpretation has superfluity problems of its own. Pp. 8\u201312.\n    (c) The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general\n reinforces what \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\u2019s text suggests. Design defects do\n not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Admini\n stration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufactur\n ing process. This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men\n  tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men\n  tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act\u2019s mandates\n  lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve\n  ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,\n  which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de\n  sign-defect torts\u2014prompting the development of improved designs,\n  and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act\u2019s struc\n  tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine\n  manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for\n  vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the\n  occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund\n  the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de\n  fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar\n  ket.

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncines became, one might say, victims of their own success.\nThey had been so effective in preventing infectious dis\neases that the public became much less alarmed at the\nthreat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with\nthe risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5\n   Much of the concern centered around vaccines against\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were\nblamed for children\u2019s disabilities and developmental de\nlays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort\nlitigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine\nproduct-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur\ners, by the mid-1980\u2019s the suits numbered more than 200\neach year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,\ncausing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with\ndraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato\nries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its\nannual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose\nwhen Lederle had production problems in 1984.8\n   Despite the large number of suits, there were many\ncomplaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate\nvaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 See Mortimer, Immunization Against Infectious Disease, 200 Sci\n\nence 902, 906 (1978).\n   5 See National Vaccine Advisory Committee, A Comprehensive Re\n\nview of Federal Vaccine Safety Programs and Public Health Activities\n2\u20133 (Dec. 2008) (hereinafter NVAC), http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/\ndocuments/vaccine-safety-review.pdf (as visited Feb. 18, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   6 See Sing & Willian, Supplying Vaccines: An Overview of the Market\n\nand Regulatory Context, in Supplying Vaccines: An Economic Analysis\nof Critical Issues 45, 51\u201352 (M.

The Act estab\nlishes a no-fault compensation program \u201cdesigned to work\nfaster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.\u201d\nShalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U. S. 268, 269 (1995). A per\nson injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a\npetition for compensation in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services as the respondent.13 A special master\nthen makes an informal adjudication of the petition within\n(except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.14 The Court\nof Federal Claims must review objections to the special\nmaster\u2019s decision and enter final judgment under a simi\nlarly tight statutory deadline.15 At that point, a claimant\nhas two options: to accept the court\u2019s judgment and forgo a\ntraditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment\nand seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.16\n   Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act\u2019s\nVaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered\nunder the Act; describes each vaccine\u2019s compensable,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLawsuits, and Legal Rights: The Battle over Litigation in American\nSociety 146 (2002).\n  10 Mortimer, supra, at 906.\n  11 See Hagan, 45 Food Drug Cosm.

The Act\nrequires claimants to seek relief through the compensation\nprogram before filing suit for more than $1,000.24 Manu\nfacturers are generally immunized from liability for fail\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See \u00a7300aa\u201314(a); 42 CFR \u00a7100.3 (2009) (current Vaccine Injury\n\nTable).\n  18 See 42 U.

It first received federal\napproval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in\n1953 and 1970. Respondent Wyeth purchased Lederle in\n1994 and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in 1998.\n  Hannah Bruesewitz was born on October 20, 1991. Her\npediatrician administered doses of the DTP vaccine ac\ncording to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s recommended\nchildhood immunization schedule.

The Bruesewitzes\nelected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October\n2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their\ncomplaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design\nof Lederle\u2019s DTP vaccine caused Hannah\u2019s disabilities, and\nthat Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for\nnegligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31\n   Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which\ngranted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability\nand negligence design-defect claims, holding that the\nPennsylvania law providing those causes of action was\npreempted by 42 U.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine\nmanufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con\nsidered \u201cunavoidable\u201d under the statute. Provided that\nthere was proper manufacture and warning, any remain\ning side effects, including those resulting from design\ndefects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law\ndesign-defect claims are therefore preempted.\n   If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a\ndifferent design, the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d would do no\nwork. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been\navoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element. The language of the\nprovision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a\ngiven, not subject to question in the tort action. What the\nstatute establishes as a complete defense must be un\navoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with\nrespect to the particular design.

Products-liability law establishes a classic and well\nknown triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective\nmanufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and\ndefective design.36 If all three were intended to be pre\nserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only\ntwo, and leave the third to implication. It would have\nbeen much easier (and much more natural) to provide that\nmanufacturers would be liable for \u201cdefective manufacture,\ndefective directions or warning, and defective design.\u201d It\nseems that the statute fails to mention design-defect\nliability \u201cby deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\u201d Barn\nhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003). Ex\npressio unius, exclusio alterius.\n                              B\n  The dissent\u2019s principal textual argument is mistaken.\nWe agree with its premise that \u201c \u2018side effects that were\nunavoidable\u2019 must refer to side effects caused by a vac\ncine\u2019s design.\u201d37 We do not comprehend, however, the\nsecond step of its reasoning, which is that the use of\nthe conditional term \u201cif\u201d in the introductory phrase \u201cif the\ninjury or death resulted from side effects that were un\navoidable\u201d \u201cplainly implies that some side effects stem\nming from a vaccine\u2019s design are \u2018unavoidable,\u2019 while\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWe doubt that Congress would introduce such an amorphous test by\nimplication when it otherwise micromanages vaccine manufacturers.\nSee infra, at 13\u201314. We have no idea how much more expensive an\nalternative design can be before it \u201ccompromis[es]\u201d a vaccine\u2019s cost or\nhow much efficacy an alternative design can sacrifice to improve safety.\nNeither does the dissent. And neither will the judges who must rule on\nmotions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and motions for\njudgment as a matter of law. Which means that the test would proba\nbly have no real-world effect.\n  36 W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

The \u201cif \u201d clause\nmakes total sense whether the design to which \u201cunavoid\nable\u201d refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design\n(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine\nat issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design\nused for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un\navoidable). Under the latter view, the condition estab\nlished by the \u201cif\u201d clause is that the vaccine have been\nproperly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,\nthat it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac\ntured. Neither view renders the \u201cif \u201d clause a nullity.\nWhich of the two variants must be preferred is addressed\nby our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by\nthe \u201cif \u201d clause.\n   Petitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s textual argument also\nrests upon the proposition that the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com\nment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A (1963\u2013\n1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer\nstrictly liable for harm to person or property caused by\n\u201cany product in a defective condition unreasonably dan\ngerous to the user.\u201d40 Comment k exempts from this\nstrict-liability rule \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d An\nunavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of\ncriteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies\nvaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this\nlack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the\ncomment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of\ncourts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an\n\u201cunavoidably unsafe product\u201d: a case-specific showing that\nthe product was \u201cquite incapable of being made safer for\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 38 Ibid.\n 39 See   Brief for Petitioners 29.\n\n 40 Restatement     \u00a7402A, p. 347. \n\n10                   BRUESEWITZ v.

The phrase \u201ceven though\u201d in the clause\n\u201ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and\n[labeled]\u201d is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable\nside effects persist despite best manufacturing and label\ning practices.43 But petitioners\u2019 reading eliminates any\nopposition between the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014called a\nconcessive subordinate clause by grammarians\u2014and the\nword \u201cunavoidable.\u201d44 Their reading makes preemption\nturn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and\nproper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the\nrequirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as\n\u201ctwo additional prerequisites\u201d for preemption independent\nof unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for\nthe dissent\u2019s position depends on that independence.46\nBut linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating\njunction like \u201cand,\u201d not a subordinating junction like \u201ceven\nthough.\u201d47\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  43 The dissent\u2019s assertion that we treat \u201ceven though\u201d as a synonym\n\nfor \u201cbecause\u201d misses the subtle distinction between \u201cbecause\u201d and\n\u201cdespite.\u201d See post, at 17, n. 14. \u201cEven though\u201d is a close cousin of the\nlatter. See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.\n1957). The statement \u201cthe car accident was unavoidable despite his\nquick reflexes\u201d indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci\ndent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un\nstated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,\nbut came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only\npossible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of \u00a7300aa\u2013\n22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this\ncontext. (Incidentally, the statement \u201cthe car accident was unavoidable\nbecause of his quick reflexes\u201d makes no sense.)\n  44 See W. Follett, Modern American Usage: A Guide 61 (1966).\n  45 Post, at 9, 17.\n  46 Post, at 3\u20135.\n  47 The dissent responds that these \u201cadditional prerequisites\u201d act \u201cin a\n\nconcessive, subordinating fashion,\u201d post, at 17, n. 14 (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But that is no more true of the dissent\u2019s\nconjunctive interpretation of the present text than it is of all provisions\nthat set forth additional requirements\u2014meaning that we could elimi\nnate \u201ceven though\u201d from our English lexicon, its function being entirely\n12                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpreta\ntion we propose would render part of \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)\nsuperfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more\nclearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability\n\u201cif . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accom\npanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d The interven\ning passage (\u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects\nthat were unavoidable even though\u201d) is unnecessary. True\nenough. But the rule against giving a portion of text an\ninterpretation which renders it superfluous does not pre\nscribe that a passage which could have been more terse\ndoes not mean what it says. The rule applies only if ver\nbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend\ning passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing\ninterpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,\npetitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s interpretation gives inde\npendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed\nmeaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense\nof rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.\nSince a vaccine is not \u201cquite incapable of being made safer\nfor [its] intended use\u201d if manufacturing defects could have\nbeen eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire\n\u201ceven though\u201d clause is a useless appendage.49 It would\nsuffice to say \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side\neffects that were unavoidable\u201d\u2014full stop.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nperformed by \u201cand.\u201d No, we think \u201ceven though\u201d has a distinctive\nconcessive, subordinating role to play.\n  48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli\n\nance on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), is mis\nplaced. See id., at 449 (adopting an interpretation that was \u201cthe only\none that makes sense of each phrase\u201d in the relevant statute).\n  49 That is true regardless of whether \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) incorporates\n\ncomment k. See Restatement \u00a7402A, Comment k, pp. 353, 354 (noting\nthat \u201cunavoidably unsafe products\u201d are exempt from strict liability\n\u201cwith the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,\nand proper warning is given\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

A vaccine\u2019s license spells out the manufacturing\nmethod that must be followed and the directions and\nwarnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac\nturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini\nstration\u2019s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De\nviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of\nmanufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further\nobjective evidence comes from the FDA\u2019s regulations\u2014\nmore than 90 of them52\u2014that pervasively regulate the\nmanufacturing process, down to the requirements for\nplumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing\nfacility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,\nor with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac\nturer its regulatory-compliance defense.54\n   Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men\ntion in the NCVIA or the FDA\u2019s regulations. Indeed, the\nFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria\nit uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for\nits intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy\none. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less\nefficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not\nalways the best one. Striking the right balance between\nsafety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to\nvaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.\nYet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages\nmanufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing\ndesigns. Are manufacturers liable only for failing to em\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 50 See 42 U. S.

WYETH LLC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nploy an alternative design that the FDA has approved for\ndistribution (an approval it takes years to obtain56)? Or\ndoes it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in\nother countries? Or could there be liability for failure to\nuse a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor\nthe FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni\nverse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex\npert\u2019s imagination.\n   Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with\nlittle guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence\nof guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of\nguidance for design defects combined with the exten-\nsive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically\nmentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects\nwere not mentioned because they are not a basis for\nliability.\n   The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same\nconclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have\ntwo beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of\nimproved designs, and (2) providing compensation for\ninflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for\nachieving both effects. We have already discussed the\nAct\u2019s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro\nvides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote\n\u201cthe development of childhood vaccines that result in\nfewer and less serious adverse reactions.\u201d57 It establishes\na National Vaccine Program, whose Director is \u201cto achieve\noptimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to\nachieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.\u201d58\nThe Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re\nsearch, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 56 See Sing & William, Supplying Vaccines, at 66\u201367.\n 57 42 U.

It instead\nreflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological\njudgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na\ntional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63\n   And finally, the Act\u2019s structural quid pro quo leads to\nthe same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund\nfrom their sales an informal, efficient compensation pro\ngram for vaccine injuries;64 in exchange they avoid costly\ntort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury\nverdict.65 But design-defect allegations are the most\nspeculative and difficult type of products liability claim to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  59 See \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u20132(a)(1)\u2013(3), 300aa\u20133.\n  60 See \u00a7300aa\u201325(b).\n  61 See NVAC 18\u201319.\n  62 See 21 CFR \u00a7601.5(b)(1)(vi) (2010).\n  63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that\n\nwe believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in\nthat fashion. See post, at 26. We do not state our preference, but\nmerely note that it is Congress\u2019s expressed preference\u2014and in order to\npreclude the argument that it is absurd to think Congress enacted such\na thing, we assert that the choice is reasonable and express some of the\nreasons why. Leaving it to the jury may (or may not) be reasonable as\nwell; we express no view.\n  64 See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201315(i)(2); Pub. L. 99\u2013660, \u00a7323(a), 100 Stat.\n\n3784. The dissent\u2019s unsupported speculation that demand in the\nvaccine market is inelastic, see post, at 24, n. 22, sheds no light on\nwhether Congress regarded the tax as a quid pro quo, most Members of\nCongress being neither professional economists nor law-and-economics\nscholars.\n  65 See 42 U.

Taxing vaccine manufacturers\u2019 product to fund\nthe compensation program, while leaving their liability for\ndesign defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax\nmanufacturers back into the market.\n   The dissent believes the Act\u2019s mandates are irrelevant\nbecause they do not spur innovation in precisely the same\nway as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges\ntion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that\nCongress would quietly preempt product-liability claims\nwithout providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.\nv. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486\u2013488 (1996) (plurality opinion),\nwe have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp\ntion unless the congressional substitute operated like the\ntort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The\ndissent\u2019s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine\nProgram cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is\nprobably questionable, but surely beside the point.\n                              IV\n  Since our interpretation of \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) is the only\ninterpretation supported by the text and structure of the\nNCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is\na legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need\nto resort to it. In any case, the dissent\u2019s contention that it\nwould contradict our conclusion is mistaken.\n  The dissent\u2019s legislative history relies on the following\nsyllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) \u201csets forth the principle contained in\nComment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts\n(Second);\u201d67 in 1986 comment k was \u201ccommonly under\nstood\u201d to require a case-specific showing that \u201cno feasible\nalternative design\u201d existed; Congress therefore must have\nintended \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 66 See post, at 21\u201324. \n\n 67 H.R.

Because the Report believes that \u00a7300aa\u2013\n22(b)(1) should incorporate \u201cthe principle in Comment K\u201d\nand because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen\nsation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who\ncannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to \u201cpursue\nrecompense in the compensation system, not the tort\nsystem.\u201d71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1).\n   Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by\na later Congress \u201cauthoritative[ly]\u201d vindicates its interpre\ntation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic\ntion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre\ntation. See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  69 1986   Report, at 26; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if the defendant manufacturer\nmay have made as safe a vaccine as anyone reasonably could expect, a\ncourt or jury undoubtedly will find it difficult to rule in favor of the\n\u2018innocent\u2019 manufacturer if the equally \u2018innocent\u2019 child has to bear the\nrisk of loss with no other possibility of recompense\u201d).\n   70 Ibid.\n   71 Ibid.\n   72 Post, at 12. This is a courageous adverb since we have previously\n\nheld that the only authoritative source of statutory meaning is the text\nthat has passed through the Article I process.

Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is\npersuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on\nwhat legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text\nto mean when they voted to enact it into law. See Exxon\nMobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568\n(2005). But post-enactment legislative history by defini\ntion \u201ccould have had no effect on the congressional vote,\u201d\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).\n   It does not matter that \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1) did not take\neffect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that\nfunds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly\ndispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding\nlegislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory\nlanguage were not necessarily the same persons who\ncrafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if\nthey were did not necessarily have the same views at that\nearlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could\npossibly have been informed by those later statements.\nPermitting the legislative history of subsequent funding\nlegislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a\ndangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law\ndepend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75\nthey cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory\nrevision.\n   That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent\u2019s syllo\ngism: Comment k did not have a \u201ccommonly understood\nmeaning\u201d76 in the mid-1980\u2019s. Some courts thought it\nrequired a case-specific showing that a product was \u201cun\navoidably unsafe\u201d; many others thought it categorically\nexempted certain types of products from strict liability.77\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  73 Pub.

In my view,\nthe Court has the better of the purely textual argument.\nBut the textual question considered alone is a close\none. Hence, like the dissent, I would look to other\nsources, including legislative history, statutory purpose,\nand the views of the federal administrative agency, here\nsupported by expert medical opinion.

See Garcia v. United States,\n469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\u201c[T]he authoritative source for\nfinding the Legislature\u2019s intent lies in the Committee\nReports on the bill\u201d).

R.\n    Rep.).\nThe Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the\nclause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manu\nfacturing and improper labeling), while going on to state\nthat compensation for other tort claims, e.g., design-defect\nclaims, lies in \u201cthe [NCVIA\u2019s no-fault] compensation sys\ntem, not the tort system.\u201d Ibid.\n   The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Re\nport\u2019s earlier description of the statute as \u201cset[ting] forth\nthe principle contained in Comment k\u201d (of the Restate\nment Second of Torts\u2019 strict liability section, 402A) that \u201ca\nvaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or\ndeaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.\u201d Id., at 23\n(emphasis added). But the appearance of the word \u201cun\navoidable\u201d in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide\npetitioners with much help. That is because nothing in\nthe Report suggests that the statute means the word\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d to summon up an otherwise unmentioned\nthird exception encompassing suits based on design de\nfects. Nor can the Report\u2019s reference to comment k fill the\ngap. The Report itself refers, not to comment k\u2019s details,\nbut only to its \u201cprinciple,\u201d namely, that vaccine manufac\nturers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.\nIt says nothing at all about who\u2014judge, jury, or federal\nsafety agency\u2014should decide whether a safer vaccine\ncould have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress\nwrote this Report, different state courts had come to very\ndifferent conclusions about that matter.

In doing so,\nthe Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, mis\nconstrues the Act\u2019s legislative history, and disturbs the\ncareful balance Congress struck between compensating\nvaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood\nvaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum\nin which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers ade\nquately take account of scientific and technological ad\nvancements when designing or distributing their products.\nBecause nothing in the text, structure, or legislative his\ntory of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress\nintended such a result, I respectfully dissent.\n2                  BRUESEWITZ v.

This baseline rule that\nstate law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one\nof which, \u00a722(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)\nprovides:\n    \u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury\n    or death associated with the administration of a vac\n    cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re\n    sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\n    though the vaccine was properly prepared and was\n    accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d\n    \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1).\nThe provision contains two key clauses: \u201cif the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u201d\n(the \u201cif \u201d clause), and \u201ceven though the vaccine was prop\nerly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions\nand warnings\u201d (the \u201ceven though\u201d clause).\n   Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes\nthree different types of product defects: design defects,\nmanufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to\nwarn).1 The reference in the \u201ceven though\u201d clause to a\n\u201cproperly prepared\u201d vaccine \u201caccompanied by proper direc\ntions and warnings\u201d is an obvious reference to two such\ndefects\u2014manufacturing and labeling defects.

Because \u00a722(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur\ners as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each\ncivil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from\nmanufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the\nliability exemption of \u00a722(b)(1).2\n   Given that the \u201ceven though\u201d clause requires the ab\nsence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the \u201cif \u201d\nclause\u2019s reference to \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d\nmust refer to side effects caused by something other than\nmanufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining\nkind of product defect recognized under traditional prod\nucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, \u201cside effects\nthat were unavoidable\u201d must refer to side effects caused by\na vaccine\u2019s design that were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d Because\n\u00a722(b)(1) uses the conditional term \u201cif,\u201d moreover, the text\nplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a\nvaccine\u2019s design are \u201cunavoidable,\u201d while others are avoid\nable. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1124 (2002) (\u201cif \u201d means \u201cin the event that,\u201d \u201cso long as,\u201d or\n\u201con condition that\u201d). Accordingly, because the \u201cif \u201d clause\n(like the \u201ceven though\u201d clause) sets forth a condition to\ninvoke \u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s defense to tort liability, Congress must\nalso have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate\nin each civil action that the particular side effects of a\nvaccine\u2019s design were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d\n   Congress\u2019 use of conditional \u201cif\u201d clauses in two other\nprovisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that\n\u00a722(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a\nmanufacturer seeks to invoke the provision\u2019s exception to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 See Silkwood v.

There are some products which, in\nthe present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being\nmade safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially\ncommon in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine\nfor the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to\nvery serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the\ndisease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing\nand the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the\nunavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product,\nproperly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning,\nis not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of\nmany other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very\nreason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the pre\nscription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or\nexperimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity\nfor sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or\nperhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is\njustifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically\nrecognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualifica\ntion that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning\nis given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict\nliability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely\nbecause he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently\nuseful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently\nreasonable risk.\u201d Restatement 353\u2013354.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

When Con\ngress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially\ninclude a source of payment for the no-fault compensation\nprogram the Act established. The Act thus \u201cmade the\ncompensation program and accompanying tort reforms\ncontingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Respondent suggests an alternative reading of the 1986 Report.\n\nAccording to respondent, \u201cthe principle in Comment K\u201d is simply that of\nnonliability for \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d products, and thus Congress\u2019\nstated intent in the 1986 Report to apply the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\u201d\nto \u201cthe vaccines covered in the bill\u201d means that Congress viewed the\ncovered vaccines as a class to be \u201c \u2018unavoidably unsafe.\u2019 \u201d 1986 Report\n25\u201326; Brief for Respondent 42. The concurrence makes a similar\nargument. Ante, at 1\u20132 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation\nfinds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that \u201cif [injured\nindividuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a\nvaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im\nproper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom\npense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\u201d 1986 Report\n26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which\nreflected considerable disagreement in the courts over \u201cwhether com\nment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on\na case-by-case basis.\u201d Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and\nStrict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the\nSellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11\n(1989\u20131990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under\nmined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines\nfor optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20\u201322, and n. 19, and thus it\nseems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi\ntional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu\nlarly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity\nas to how precisely Congress intended the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\u201d to\napply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in\npetitioners\u2019 favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport, H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013391, pt. 1, pp. 690\u2013691 (hereinafter 1987\nReport). See infra this page and 11\u201312.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

In 1987, Con\ngress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro\ngram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated\nthat \u201cthe codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement\n(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of\nlaw the circumstances in which a vaccine should be\ndeemed unavoidably unsafe.\u201d Id., at 691. The Committee\nnoted that \u201c[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manu\nfacturer\u2019s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not\ngrounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during\nits original consideration of the Act.\u201d Ibid. In light of that\nrejection, the Committee emphasized that \u201cthere should be\nno misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a\nmatter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe\nor not,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his question is left to the courts to\ndetermine in accordance with applicable law.\u201d Ibid.\n   To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by\na subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis\nfrom which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.\nSee Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 631\u2013632 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part). But unlike ordinary\npostenactment legislative history, which is justifiably\ngiven little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the\nintent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation\nnecessary to give operative effect to the principal provi\nsions of the Vaccine Act, including \u00a722(b)(1).10 Congress in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion below expressed uncertainty as to\n\nwhether the 1987 Report was authored by the House Budget Commit\ntee or the House Energy and Commerce Committee. See 561 F. 3d 233,\n250 (2009). As petitioners explain, although the Budget Committee\ncompiled and issued the Report, the Energy and Commerce Committee\nwrote and approved the relevant language.

WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1987 had a number of options before it, including adopting\nan entirely different compensation scheme, as the Reagan\nadministration was proposing;11 establishing different\nlimitations on tort liability, including eliminating design\ndefect liability, as pharmaceutical industry leaders were\nadvocating;12 or not funding the compensation program at\nall, which would have effectively nullified the relevant\nportions of the Act. Because the tort reforms in the 1986\nAct, including \u00a722(b)(1), had no operative legal effect\nunless and until Congress provided funding for the com\npensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted\nthat funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authori\ntative guide to the meaning of \u00a722(b)(1). Those views, as\nreflected in the 1987 Report, provide unequivocal confir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ning mechanism is akin to appropriations legislation and that giving\nweight to the legislative history of such legislation \u201cwould set a danger\nous precedent.\u201d Ante, at 18. The difference, of course, is that appro\npriations legislation ordinarily funds congressional enactments that\nalready have operative legal effect; in contrast, operation of the tort\nreforms in the 1986 Act, including \u00a722(b)(1), was expressly conditioned\non the enactment of a separate tax to fund the compensation program.\nSee \u00a7323(a), 100 Stat. 3784. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s general reluc\ntance to view appropriations legislation as modifying substantive\nlegislation, see, e.g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 190 (1978), has no\nbearing here.\n   11 See 1987 Report 700 (describing the administration\u2019s alternative\n\nproposal).\n   12 See, e.g., Hearings on Funding of the Childhood Vaccine Program\n\nbefore the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the House\nCommittee on Ways and Means, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 85 (1987)\n(\u201c[T]he liability provisions of the 1986 Act should be amended to assure\nthat manufacturers will not be found liable in the tort system if they\nhave fully complied with applicable government regulations.

Accordingly, I believe \u00a722(b)(1) exempts\nvaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a\nshowing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine\nwas properly manufactured and labeled, and that the side\neffects stemming from the vaccine\u2019s design could not have\nbeen prevented by a feasible alternative design that would\nhave eliminated the adverse side effects without compro\nmising the vaccine\u2019s cost and utility.\n                             II\n  In contrast to the interpretation of \u00a722(b)(1) set forth\nabove, the majority\u2019s interpretation does considerable vio\nlence to the statutory text, misconstrues the legislative\nhistory, and draws the wrong conclusions from the struc\nture of the Vaccine Act and the broader federal scheme\nregulating vaccines.\n                             A\n   As a textual matter, the majority\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a722(b)(1) is fundamentally flawed in three central re\nspects. First, the majority\u2019s categorical reading rests on a\nfaulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading func\ntionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including\nthe key term \u201cunavoidable.\u201d And third, the majority en\ntirely ignores the Vaccine Act\u2019s default rule preserving\nstate tort law.\n   To begin, the majority states that \u201c[a] side effect of a\nvaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a\ndifferently designed vaccine not containing the harmful\nelement.\u201d Ante, at 7. From that premise, the majority\nconcludes that the statute must mean that \u201cthe design of\nthe vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort\naction,\u201d because construing the statute otherwise would\n14                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrender \u00a722(b)(1) a nullity. Ibid. A tort claimant, accord\ning to the majority, will always be able to point to a differ\nently designed vaccine not containing the \u201charmful ele\nment,\u201d and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine\u2019s\nside effects were not \u201cunavoidable,\u201d the statute would pre\nempt nothing.\n   The starting premise of the majority\u2019s interpretation,\nhowever, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal\nsense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be\navoided \u201cby use of a differently designed vaccine not con\ntaining the harmful element,\u201d ibid., this interpretation of\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d would effectively read the term out of the\nstatute, and Congress could not have intended that result.\nIndeed, \u00a722(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase\n\u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were\nunavoidable,\u201d which plainly indicates that Congress con\ntemplated that there would be some instances in which a\nvaccine\u2019s side effects are \u201cunavoidable\u201d and other in\nstances in which they are not. See supra, at 3. The major\nity\u2019s premise that a vaccine\u2019s side effects can always be\n\u201cavoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element,\u201d ante, at 7, entirely ig\nnores the fact that removing the \u201charmful element\u201d will\noften result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective)\nvaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a\nkilled or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate\nantibody production;13 removing that bacteria or virus\nmight remove the \u201charmful element,\u201d but it would also\nnecessarily render the vaccine inert. As explained above,\nthe legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases\ninterpreting comment k make clear that a side effect is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 SeeAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Questions and Answers about\nVaccine Ingredients (Oct. 2008), http://www.aap.org/immunization/\nfamilies/faq/Vaccineingredients.pdf (all Internet materials as visited\nFeb. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

See supra, at 7. The majority\u2019s premise\u2014that\nside effects stemming from a vaccine\u2019s design are always\navoidable\u2014is thus belied by the statutory text and legisla\ntive history of \u00a722(b)(1). And because its starting premise\nis invalid, its conclusion\u2014that the design of a vaccine is\nnot subject to challenge in a tort action\u2014is also necessar\nily invalid.\n    The majority\u2019s reading suffers from an even more fun\ndamental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine\nmanufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil\nity, it more logically would have provided: \u201cNo vaccine\nmanufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages\narising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated\nwith the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,\nif the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\nby proper directions and warnings.\u201d There would have\nbeen no need for Congress to include the additional 13\nwords \u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that\nwere unavoidable even though.\u201d See TRW Inc. v.

See\nante, at 12 (\u201cThe intervening passage (\u2018the injury or death\nresulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\nthough\u2019) is unnecessary. True enough\u201d). Nevertheless, the\nmajority contends that \u201cthe rule against giving a portion of\ntext an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . .\napplies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by\ngiving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text,\na competing interpretation.\u201d Ibid. According to the major\nity, petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a722(b)(1) renders the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners\u2019\ndesired outcome, \u201c[i]t would suffice to say \u2018if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u2019\u2014\nfull stop.\u201d Ibid. As explained above, however, the \u201ceven\nthough\u201d clause establishes two additional prerequisites\u2014\nproper manufacturing and proper labeling\u2014to qualify for\n\u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s exemption from liability. Contrary to the ma\njority\u2019s contention, then, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause serves\nan important function by limiting the scope of the pre\nemption afforded by the preceding \u201cif \u201d clause.14\n   The majority\u2019s only other textual argument is based on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 In this manner, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause functions in a \u201cconcessive\n\nsubordinat[ing]\u201d fashion, ante, at 11, in accord with normal grammati\ncal usage. According to the majority, however, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\n\u201cclarifies the word that precedes it\u201d by \u201cdelineat[ing]\u201d the conditions\nthat make a side effect \u201cunavoidable\u201d under the statute. Ante, at 7.\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation hardly treats the clause as \u201cconcessive,\u201d\nand indeed strains the meaning of \u201ceven though.\u201d In the majority\u2019s\nview, proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that\nrender a vaccine\u2019s side effects unavoidable. Thus, an injurious side\neffect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and\nlabeled, not \u201ceven though\u201d it was. The two conjunctions are not equiva\nlent: The sentence \u201cI am happy even though it is raining\u201d can hardly be\nread to mean that \u201cI am happy because it is raining.\u201d In any event, the\nmore fundamental point is that petitioners\u2019 interpretation actually\ngives meaning to the words \u201ceven though,\u201d whereas the majority\nconcedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely\nout of the statute. See supra this page.\n18                   BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon. According to\nthe majority, because blackletter products liability law\ngenerally recognizes three different types of product de\nfects, \u201c[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would\nbe strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only\ntwo\u201d\u2014namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the\n\u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014\u201cand leave the third to implication.\u201d\nAnte, at 8. The majority\u2019s argument, however, ignores\nthat the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state\nlaw is preserved. As explained above, \u00a722(a) expressly\nprovides that the \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d is that \u201cState law shall\napply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine\nrelated injury or death.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(a). Be\ncause \u00a722(a) already preserves state-law design defect\nclaims (to the extent the exemption in \u00a722(b)(1) does not\napply), there was no need for Congress separately and\nexpressly to preserve design defect claims in \u00a722(b)(1).\nIndeed, Congress\u2019 principal aim in enacting \u00a722(b)(1) was\nnot to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those,\ntoo, were already preserved by \u00a722(a)), but rather, to\nfederalize comment k-type protection for \u201cunavoidably\nunsafe\u201d vaccines. The \u201ceven though\u201d clause simply func\ntions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of\nexpress language in \u00a722(b)(1) specifically preserving de\nsign defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as\nimpliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional\nstate tort claims, which had already been preserved by\n\u00a722(a).15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 This Court, moreover, has long operated on \u201cthe assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the\nFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.\u201d Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Given the long\nhistory of state regulation of vaccines, see Brief for Petitioners 3\u20136, the\npresumption provides an additional reason not to read \u00a722(b)(1) as pre\nempting all design defect claims, especially given Congress\u2019 inclusion of\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Putting aside the fact that \u00a722(a) already preserves\ndesign defect claims (to the extent \u00a722(b)(1) does not ap\nply), the majority\u2019s proposed solution would not have fully\neffectuated Congress\u2019 intent. As the legislative history\nmakes clear, Congress used the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d to\neffectuate its intent that the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\nregarding \u2018unavoidably unsafe\u2019 products . . . apply to the\nvaccines covered in the bill.\u201d 1986 Report 26; see also\n1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act\u2019s enact\nment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected\ncomment k,16 while many others had not addressed the\napplicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap\nplied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory\nother than strict liability (e.g., negligence17).

The principal thrust of the majority\u2019s\nposition is that, since nothing in the Vaccine Act or the\nFDA\u2019s regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions\ndesign defects, Congress must have intended to remove\nissues concerning the design of FDA-licensed vaccines\nfrom the tort system. Ante, at 13. The flaw in that rea\nsoning, of course, is that the FDA\u2019s silence on design de\nfects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.\nIndeed, the majority itself concedes that the \u201cFDA has\nnever even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to\ndecide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its in\ntended use.\u201d18 Ibid. And yet it is undisputed that prior to\nthe Act, vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to\nliability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.\nThat the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehen\nsive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is\nthus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly\ndecided to change course sub silentio and pre-empt a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnegligence\u201d); Toner, 112 Idaho, at 340, 732 P. 2d, at 309\u2013310 (\u201cThe\nauthorities universally agree that where a product is deemed unavoid\nably unsafe, the plaintiff is deprived of the advantage of a strict liabil\nity cause of action, but may proceed under a negligence cause of ac\ntion\u201d).\n   18 See 42 U.

See 1987\nReport 691 (\u201cIt is not the Committee\u2019s intention to pre\nclude court actions under applicable law. The Commit\ntee\u2019s intent at the time of considering the Act . . . was . . .\nto leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as\nexpressly altered by the Act\u201d).\n  The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily\nintended to pre-empt design defect claims since the aim of\nsuch tort suits is to promote the development of improved\ndesigns and provide compensation for injured individuals,\nand the Vaccine Act \u201cprovides other means for achieving\nboth effects\u201d\u2014most notably through the no-fault compen\nsation program and the National Vaccine Program.

But\nthe majority\u2019s position elides a significant difference be\ntween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.\nAlthough the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services with the obligation to \u201cpromote the\ndevelopment of childhood vaccines\u201d and \u201cmake or assure\nimprovements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,\u201d\n\u00a7300aa\u201327(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of\nfederal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers\nto improve the design of their vaccines to account for\nscientific and technological advances.

The regulation does not authorize the FDA to revoke a\nbiologics license for a manufacturer\u2019s failure to adopt an optimal\nvaccine design in light of existing science and technology.

The normal competitive\nforces that spur innovation and improvements to existing\nproduct lines in other markets thus operate with less force\nin the vaccine market, particularly for vaccines that have\nalready been released and marketed to the public. Absent\na clear statutory mandate to the contrary, there is no\nreason to think that Congress intended in the vaccine\ncontext to eliminate the traditional incentive and deter\nrence functions served by state tort liability in favor of a\nfederal regulatory scheme providing only carrots and no\nsticks.21 See Levine, 555 U.

As the legislative history indicates, the\nAct addressed \u201ctwo overriding concerns\u201d: \u201c(a) the inade\nquacy\u2014from both the perspective of vaccine-injured per\nsons as well as vaccine manufacturers\u2014of the current\napproach to compensating those who have been damaged\nby a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of\nthe childhood vaccine market.\u201d 1986 Report 7. When\nviewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole,\n\u00a722(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme\nthat balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured\nchildren with added liability protections for vaccine manu\nfacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.\n  The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of\nthe no-fault compensation program\u2014a scheme funded\nentirely through an excise tax on vaccines.22 Through that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to displace a longstanding species\nof state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an\nexpress saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of\nstate-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law\nwould leave an important regulatory function\u2014i.e., ensuring optimal\nvaccine design\u2014entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.\n  22 The majority\u2019s suggestion that \u201cvaccine manufacturers fund from\n\ntheir sales\u201d the compensation program is misleading.

The structure and legislative history,\nmoreover, point clearly to Congress\u2019 intention to divert\nwould-be tort claimants into the compensation program,\nrather than eliminate a longstanding category of tradi\ntional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (\u201cThe Committee\nanticipates that the speed of the compensation program,\nthe low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault na\nture of the required findings, and the relative certainty\nand generosity of the system\u2019s awards will divert a signifi\ncant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation\u201d). In\ndeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would\nhave eliminated the principal source of the \u201cunpredictabil\nity\u201d in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose not\nto pre-empt state tort claims categorically. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(a) (providing as a \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d that \u201cState\nlaw shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a\nvaccine-related injury or death\u201d). That decision reflects\nCongress\u2019 recognition that court actions are essential\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvaccines/programs/vfc/cdc-vac-price-list.htm. Accordingly, the only way\nthe vaccine manufacturers can be said to actually \u201cfund\u201d the compensa\ntion program is if the cost of the excise tax has an impact on the num\nber of vaccines sold by the vaccine manufacturer. The majority points\nto no evidence that the excise tax\u2014which ordinarily amounts to 75\ncents per dose, 26 U. S. C. \u00a74131(b)\u2014has any impact whatsoever on the\ndemand for vaccines.\n   23 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (\u201cDepartment of\n\nJustice records indicate that 99.8% of successful Compensation Pro\ngram claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort reme\ndies against vaccine manufacturers\u201d); S.

See \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u2013\n12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3). Congress thus clearly believed there\nwas still an important function to be played by state tort\nlaw.\n   Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,\nCongress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac\nturers\u2019 liability exposure, including a limited regulatory\ncompliance presumption of adequate warnings, see\n\u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure\nto provide direct warnings to patients, \u00a7300aa\u201322(c), a\nheightened standard for punitive damages, \u00a7300aa\u2013\n23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for \u201cun\navoidable\u201d side effects, \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1). Considered in\nlight of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \u00a722(b)(1)\u2019s exemption\nfrom liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one\npart of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress\u2019\ncareful balance between providing adequate compensation\nfor vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial\nbenefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and\npredictable childhood vaccine supply.\n   The majority\u2019s decision today disturbs that careful\nbalance based on a bare policy preference that it is better\n\u201cto leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine\ndesign to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program\nrather than juries.\u201d Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable\nminds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries\nweigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac\ncine design.

Brief for Respondent 56\u201357. Accord\ning to respondent, a ruling that \u00a722(b)(1) does not pre-empt design\ndefect claims could unleash a \u201ccrushing wave\u201d of tort litigation that\nwould bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply.\nId., at 28. This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in\nrespondent\u2019s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring\nopinions in this case. In the absence of any empirical data, however,\nthe prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claim\nants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative. As\nan initial matter, the special masters in the autism cases have thus far\nuniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism.\nSee Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as Amici Curiae\n20\u201321, n. 4 (collecting cases). To be sure, those rulings do not necessar\nily mean that no such causal link exists, cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine\nInjury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately\nbe able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the\nadded tool of civil discovery. But these rulings do highlight the sub\nstantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See Schafer v. American\nCyanamid Co., 20 F. 3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (\u201c[A] petitioner to whom the\nVaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort\nlaw\u2019s yet more serious obstacles to recovery\u201d). Trial courts, moreover,\nhave considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of\nmeritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (in\ncluding for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led\nto shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of\nrespondent and the various amici cited by the concurrence, ante, at 6\u20137,\nthe possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufac\nturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More\nfundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the\nissue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question,\nthe text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that\nCongress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who\nhave suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The\nmajority\u2019s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress\u2019 role\nand deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Con\ngress intended them to have.\n28               BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npre-empt all design defect claims against vaccine manu\nfacturers for covered vaccines, the majority\u2019s decision\nleaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one\u2014neither the\nFDA nor any other federal agency, nor state and federal\njuries\u2014ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately\ntake account of scientific and technological advancements.\nThis concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines\nthat have already been released and marketed to the\npublic. Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competi\ntion in the vaccine market, will often have little or no\nincentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are al\nready generating significant profit margins. Nothing in\nthe text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests\nthat Congress intended that result.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
