Argued October 12, 2010—Decided February 22, 2011\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) cre\n  ated a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market\n  adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation\n  and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing le\n  gitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult. The Act\n  provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a peti\n  tion for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the\n  Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the\n  court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the\n  claimant can then decide whether to accept the court’s judgment or\n  reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer. Awards\n  are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.\n  As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability pro\n  tections. Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability\n  for a vaccine’s unavoidable, adverse side effects.\n     Hannah Bruesewitz’s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the\n  Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled af\n  ter receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine\n  manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent\n  Wyeth). After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the\n  unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, al\n  leging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederle’s DTP vaccine\n  caused Hannah’s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict\n  liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania com\n  mon law. Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court. It\n  granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Penn\n  sylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), which\n2                     BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    provides that “[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death asso\n    ciated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if\n    the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable\n    even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\n    by proper directions and warnings.” The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine\n manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury\n or death caused by a vaccine’s side effects. Pp. 7–19.\n    (a) Section 300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests that a vaccine’s design is\n not open to question in a tort action. If a manufacturer could be held\n liable for failure to use a different design, the “even though” clause\n would do no work. A vaccine side effect could always have been\n avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful\n element. The language of the provision thus suggests the design is\n not subject to question in a tort action. What the statute establishes\n as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufac\n ture and warning) with respect to the particular design. This conclu\n sion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law es\n tablishes three grounds for liability—defective manufacture,\n inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design—the Act\n mentions only manufacture and warnings. It thus seems that the\n Act’s failure to mention design-defect liability is “by deliberate choice,\n not inadvertence.” Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.\n Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Contrary to petitioners’ argument, there is no reason to believe\n that §300aa–22(b)(1)’s term “unavoidable” is a term of art incorporat\n ing Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A, Comment k, which exempts\n from strict liability rules “unavoidably unsafe products.” “Unavoid\n able” is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k\n attach special significance only to the term “unavoidably unsafe\n products,” not the word “unavoidable” standing alone. Moreover,\n reading the phrase “side effects that were unavoidable” to exempt in\n juries caused by flawed design would require treating “even though”\n as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a\n concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause\n weakens or qualifies the other. The canon against superfluity does\n not undermine this Court’s interpretation because petitioners’ com\n peting interpretation has superfluity problems of its own. Pp. 8–12.\n    (c) The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general\n reinforces what §300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests. Design defects do\n not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Admini\n stration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufactur\n ing process. This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men\n  tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men\n  tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act’s mandates\n  lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve\n  ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,\n  which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de\n  sign-defect torts—prompting the development of improved designs,\n  and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act’s struc\n  tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine\n  manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for\n  vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the\n  occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund\n  the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de\n  fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar\n  ket.

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncines became, one might say, victims of their own success.\nThey had been so effective in preventing infectious dis\neases that the public became much less alarmed at the\nthreat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with\nthe risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5\n   Much of the concern centered around vaccines against\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were\nblamed for children’s disabilities and developmental de\nlays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort\nlitigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine\nproduct-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur\ners, by the mid-1980’s the suits numbered more than 200\neach year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,\ncausing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with\ndraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato\nries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its\nannual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose\nwhen Lederle had production problems in 1984.8\n   Despite the large number of suits, there were many\ncomplaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate\nvaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A\n——————\n   4 See Mortimer, Immunization Against Infectious Disease, 200 Sci\n\nence 902, 906 (1978).\n   5 See National Vaccine Advisory Committee, A Comprehensive Re\n\nview of Federal Vaccine Safety Programs and Public Health Activities\n2–3 (Dec. 2008) (hereinafter NVAC), http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/\ndocuments/vaccine-safety-review.pdf (as visited Feb. 18, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n   6 See Sing & Willian, Supplying Vaccines: An Overview of the Market\n\nand Regulatory Context, in Supplying Vaccines: An Economic Analysis\nof Critical Issues 45, 51–52 (M.

The Act estab\nlishes a no-fault compensation program “designed to work\nfaster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.”\nShalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U. S. 268, 269 (1995). A per\nson injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a\npetition for compensation in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services as the respondent.13 A special master\nthen makes an informal adjudication of the petition within\n(except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.14 The Court\nof Federal Claims must review objections to the special\nmaster’s decision and enter final judgment under a simi\nlarly tight statutory deadline.15 At that point, a claimant\nhas two options: to accept the court’s judgment and forgo a\ntraditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment\nand seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.16\n   Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act’s\nVaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered\nunder the Act; describes each vaccine’s compensable,\n\n——————\nLawsuits, and Legal Rights: The Battle over Litigation in American\nSociety 146 (2002).\n  10 Mortimer, supra, at 906.\n  11 See Hagan, 45 Food Drug Cosm.

It first received federal\napproval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in\n1953 and 1970. Respondent Wyeth purchased Lederle in\n1994 and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in 1998.\n  Hannah Bruesewitz was born on October 20, 1991.

WYETH LLC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nseizures.28 She suffered over 100 seizures during the next\nmonth, and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with\n“residual seizure disorder” and “developmental delay.”29\nHannah, now a teenager, is still diagnosed with both\nconditions.\n   In April 1995, Hannah’s parents, Russell and Robalee\nBruesewitz, filed a vaccine injury petition in the United\nStates Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Hannah\nsuffered from on-Table residual seizure disorder and\nencephalopathy injuries.30 A Special Master denied their\nclaims on various grounds, though they were awarded\n$126,800 in attorney’s fees and costs. The Bruesewitzes\nelected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October\n2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their\ncomplaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design\nof Lederle’s DTP vaccine caused Hannah’s disabilities, and\nthat Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for\nnegligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31\n   Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which\ngranted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability\nand negligence design-defect claims, holding that the\nPennsylvania law providing those causes of action was\npreempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1).32 The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.33\nWe granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n\n——————\n  28 See Bruesewitz v.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine\nmanufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con\nsidered “unavoidable” under the statute. Provided that\nthere was proper manufacture and warning, any remain\ning side effects, including those resulting from design\ndefects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law\ndesign-defect claims are therefore preempted.\n   If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a\ndifferent design, the word “unavoidable” would do no\nwork. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been\navoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element. The language of the\nprovision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a\ngiven, not subject to question in the tort action. What the\nstatute establishes as a complete defense must be un\navoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with\nrespect to the particular design. Which plainly implies\nthat the design itself is not open to question.35\n——————\n  34 42U. S.

Products-liability law establishes a classic and well\nknown triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective\nmanufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and\ndefective design.36 If all three were intended to be pre\nserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only\ntwo, and leave the third to implication. It would have\nbeen much easier (and much more natural) to provide that\nmanufacturers would be liable for “defective manufacture,\ndefective directions or warning, and defective design.” It\nseems that the statute fails to mention design-defect\nliability “by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.” Barn\nhart v.

The “if ” clause\nmakes total sense whether the design to which “unavoid\nable” refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design\n(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine\nat issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design\nused for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un\navoidable). Under the latter view, the condition estab\nlished by the “if” clause is that the vaccine have been\nproperly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,\nthat it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac\ntured. Neither view renders the “if ” clause a nullity.\nWhich of the two variants must be preferred is addressed\nby our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by\nthe “if ” clause.\n   Petitioners’ and the dissent’s textual argument also\nrests upon the proposition that the word “unavoidable” in\n§300aa–22(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com\nment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1963–\n1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer\nstrictly liable for harm to person or property caused by\n“any product in a defective condition unreasonably dan\ngerous to the user.”40 Comment k exempts from this\nstrict-liability rule “unavoidably unsafe products.” An\nunavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of\ncriteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies\nvaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this\nlack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the\ncomment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of\ncourts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an\n“unavoidably unsafe product”: a case-specific showing that\nthe product was “quite incapable of being made safer for\n\n\n——————\n 38 Ibid.\n 39 See   Brief for Petitioners 29.\n\n 40 Restatement     §402A, p. 347. \n\n10                   BRUESEWITZ v.

The phrase “even though” in the clause\n“even though the vaccine was properly prepared and\n[labeled]” is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable\nside effects persist despite best manufacturing and label\ning practices.43 But petitioners’ reading eliminates any\nopposition between the “even though” clause—called a\nconcessive subordinate clause by grammarians—and the\nword “unavoidable.”44 Their reading makes preemption\nturn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and\nproper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the\nrequirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as\n“two additional prerequisites” for preemption independent\nof unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for\nthe dissent’s position depends on that independence.46\nBut linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating\njunction like “and,” not a subordinating junction like “even\nthough.”47\n——————\n  43 The dissent’s assertion that we treat “even though” as a synonym\n\nfor “because” misses the subtle distinction between “because” and\n“despite.” See post, at 17, n. 14. “Even though” is a close cousin of the\nlatter. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.\n1957). The statement “the car accident was unavoidable despite his\nquick reflexes” indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci\ndent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un\nstated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,\nbut came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only\npossible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of §300aa–\n22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this\ncontext. (Incidentally, the statement “the car accident was unavoidable\nbecause of his quick reflexes” makes no sense.)\n  44 See W. Follett, Modern American Usage: A Guide 61 (1966).\n  45 Post, at 9, 17.\n  46 Post, at 3–5.\n  47 The dissent responds that these “additional prerequisites” act “in a\n\nconcessive, subordinating fashion,” post, at 17, n. 14 (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But that is no more true of the dissent’s\nconjunctive interpretation of the present text than it is of all provisions\nthat set forth additional requirements—meaning that we could elimi\nnate “even though” from our English lexicon, its function being entirely\n12                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpreta\ntion we propose would render part of §300aa–22(b)(1)\nsuperfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more\nclearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability\n“if . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accom\npanied by proper directions and warnings.” The interven\ning passage (“the injury or death resulted from side effects\nthat were unavoidable even though”) is unnecessary. True\nenough. But the rule against giving a portion of text an\ninterpretation which renders it superfluous does not pre\nscribe that a passage which could have been more terse\ndoes not mean what it says. The rule applies only if ver\nbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend\ning passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing\ninterpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,\npetitioners’ and the dissent’s interpretation gives inde\npendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed\nmeaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense\nof rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.\nSince a vaccine is not “quite incapable of being made safer\nfor [its] intended use” if manufacturing defects could have\nbeen eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire\n“even though” clause is a useless appendage.49 It would\nsuffice to say “if the injury or death resulted from side\neffects that were unavoidable”—full stop.\n\n——————\nperformed by “and.” No, we think “even though” has a distinctive\nconcessive, subordinating role to play.\n  48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli\n\nance on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), is mis\nplaced. See id., at 449 (adopting an interpretation that was “the only\none that makes sense of each phrase” in the relevant statute).\n  49 That is true regardless of whether §300aa–22(b)(1) incorporates\n\ncomment k. See Restatement §402A, Comment k, pp. 353, 354 (noting\nthat “unavoidably unsafe products” are exempt from strict liability\n“with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,\nand proper warning is given”).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

A vaccine’s license spells out the manufacturing\nmethod that must be followed and the directions and\nwarnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac\nturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini\nstration’s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De\nviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of\nmanufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further\nobjective evidence comes from the FDA’s regulations—\nmore than 90 of them52—that pervasively regulate the\nmanufacturing process, down to the requirements for\nplumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing\nfacility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,\nor with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac\nturer its regulatory-compliance defense.54\n   Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men\ntion in the NCVIA or the FDA’s regulations. Indeed, the\nFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria\nit uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for\nits intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy\none. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less\nefficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not\nalways the best one. Striking the right balance between\nsafety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to\nvaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.\nYet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages\nmanufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing\ndesigns. Are manufacturers liable only for failing to em\n——————\n 50 See 42 U. S.

Or\ndoes it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in\nother countries? Or could there be liability for failure to\nuse a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor\nthe FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni\nverse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex\npert’s imagination.\n   Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with\nlittle guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence\nof guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of\nguidance for design defects combined with the exten-\nsive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically\nmentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects\nwere not mentioned because they are not a basis for\nliability.\n   The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same\nconclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have\ntwo beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of\nimproved designs, and (2) providing compensation for\ninflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for\nachieving both effects. We have already discussed the\nAct’s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro\nvides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote\n“the development of childhood vaccines that result in\nfewer and less serious adverse reactions.”57 It establishes\na National Vaccine Program, whose Director is “to achieve\noptimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to\nachieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.”58\nThe Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re\nsearch, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi\n——————\n 56 See Sing & William, Supplying Vaccines, at 66–67.\n 57 42 U.

It instead\nreflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological\njudgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na\ntional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63\n   And finally, the Act’s structural quid pro quo leads to\nthe same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund\nfrom their sales an informal, efficient compensation pro\ngram for vaccine injuries;64 in exchange they avoid costly\ntort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury\nverdict.65 But design-defect allegations are the most\nspeculative and difficult type of products liability claim to\n——————\n  59 See §§300aa–2(a)(1)–(3), 300aa–3.\n  60 See §300aa–25(b).\n  61 See NVAC 18–19.\n  62 See 21 CFR §601.5(b)(1)(vi) (2010).\n  63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that\n\nwe believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in\nthat fashion. See post, at 26. We do not state our preference, but\nmerely note that it is Congress’s expressed preference—and in order to\npreclude the argument that it is absurd to think Congress enacted such\na thing, we assert that the choice is reasonable and express some of the\nreasons why.

The dissent’s unsupported speculation that demand in the\nvaccine market is inelastic, see post, at 24, n. 22, sheds no light on\nwhether Congress regarded the tax as a quid pro quo, most Members of\nCongress being neither professional economists nor law-and-economics\nscholars.\n  65 See 42 U.

Taxing vaccine manufacturers’ product to fund\nthe compensation program, while leaving their liability for\ndesign defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax\nmanufacturers back into the market.\n   The dissent believes the Act’s mandates are irrelevant\nbecause they do not spur innovation in precisely the same\nway as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges\ntion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that\nCongress would quietly preempt product-liability claims\nwithout providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.\nv. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486–488 (1996) (plurality opinion),\nwe have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp\ntion unless the congressional substitute operated like the\ntort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The\ndissent’s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine\nProgram cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is\nprobably questionable, but surely beside the point.\n                              IV\n  Since our interpretation of §300aa–22(b)(1) is the only\ninterpretation supported by the text and structure of the\nNCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is\na legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need\nto resort to it. In any case, the dissent’s contention that it\nwould contradict our conclusion is mistaken.\n  The dissent’s legislative history relies on the following\nsyllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that\n§300aa–22(b)(1) “sets forth the principle contained in\nComment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts\n(Second);”67 in 1986 comment k was “commonly under\nstood” to require a case-specific showing that “no feasible\nalternative design” existed; Congress therefore must have\nintended §300aa–22(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The\n——————\n 66 See post, at 21–24. \n\n 67 H.R.

Because the Report believes that §300aa–\n22(b)(1) should incorporate “the principle in Comment K”\nand because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen\nsation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who\ncannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to “pursue\nrecompense in the compensation system, not the tort\nsystem.”71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of\n§300aa–22(b)(1).\n   Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by\na later Congress “authoritative[ly]” vindicates its interpre\ntation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic\ntion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre\ntation.

But post-enactment legislative history by defini\ntion “could have had no effect on the congressional vote,”\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).\n   It does not matter that §300aa–22(b)(1) did not take\neffect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that\nfunds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly\ndispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding\nlegislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory\nlanguage were not necessarily the same persons who\ncrafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if\nthey were did not necessarily have the same views at that\nearlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could\npossibly have been informed by those later statements.\nPermitting the legislative history of subsequent funding\nlegislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a\ndangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law\ndepend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75\nthey cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory\nrevision.\n   That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent’s syllo\ngism: Comment k did not have a “commonly understood\nmeaning”76 in the mid-1980’s.

Hence, like the dissent, I would look to other\nsources, including legislative history, statutory purpose,\nand the views of the federal administrative agency, here\nsupported by expert medical opinion. Unlike the dissent,\nhowever, I believe these other sources reinforce the\nCourt’s conclusion.\n                            I\n   House Committee Report 99–908 contains an “authori\ntative” account of Congress’ intent in drafting the pre\nemption clause of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury\nAct of 1986 (NCVIA or Act). See Garcia v. United States,\n469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (“[T]he authoritative source for\nfinding the Legislature’s intent lies in the Committee\nReports on the bill”). That Report says that, “if” vaccine\ninjured persons\n    “cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that\n    a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was ac\n    companied by improper directions or inadequate\n    warnings [they] should pursue recompense in the\n2                BRUESEWITZ v.

R.\n    Rep.).\nThe Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the\nclause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manu\nfacturing and improper labeling), while going on to state\nthat compensation for other tort claims, e.g., design-defect\nclaims, lies in “the [NCVIA’s no-fault] compensation sys\ntem, not the tort system.” Ibid.\n   The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Re\nport’s earlier description of the statute as “set[ting] forth\nthe principle contained in Comment k” (of the Restate\nment Second of Torts’ strict liability section, 402A) that “a\nvaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or\ndeaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.” Id., at 23\n(emphasis added). But the appearance of the word “un\navoidable” in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide\npetitioners with much help. That is because nothing in\nthe Report suggests that the statute means the word\n“unavoidable” to summon up an otherwise unmentioned\nthird exception encompassing suits based on design de\nfects. Nor can the Report’s reference to comment k fill the\ngap. The Report itself refers, not to comment k’s details,\nbut only to its “principle,” namely, that vaccine manufac\nturers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.\nIt says nothing at all about who—judge, jury, or federal\nsafety agency—should decide whether a safer vaccine\ncould have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress\nwrote this Report, different state courts had come to very\ndifferent conclusions about that matter. See Cupp, Re\nthinking Conscious Design Liability for Prescription\nDrugs: The Restatement (Third) Standard Versus a Negli\ngence Approach, 63 Geo. Wash. L.

Id., at 5, 24.\n   Given these broad general purposes, to read the pre\nemption clause as preserving design-defect suits seems\nanomalous. The Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) decides when a vaccine is safe enough to\nbe licensed and which licensed vaccines, with which\nassociated injuries, should be placed on the Vaccine In-\njury Table. 42 U.

A special master in the Act’s\ncompensation program determines whether someone has\nsuffered an injury listed on the Injury Table and, if not,\nwhether the vaccine nonetheless caused the injury. Ante,\nat 3–4; §300aa–13. To allow a jury in effect to second\nguess those determinations is to substitute less expert for\nmore expert judgment, thereby threatening manufacturers\nwith liability (indeed, strict liability) in instances where\nany conflict between experts and nonexperts is likely to be\nparticularly severe—instances where Congress intended\nthe contrary.

Until today, that duty was\nenforceable through a traditional state-law tort action for\ndefective design. In holding that §22(b)(1) of the National\nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act),\n42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), pre-empts all design defect\nclaims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under\nthe Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference\nover the considered judgment of Congress. In doing so,\nthe Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, mis\nconstrues the Act’s legislative history, and disturbs the\ncareful balance Congress struck between compensating\nvaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood\nvaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum\nin which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers ade\nquately take account of scientific and technological ad\nvancements when designing or distributing their products.\nBecause nothing in the text, structure, or legislative his\ntory of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress\nintended such a result, I respectfully dissent.\n2                  BRUESEWITZ v.

S. C. §300aa–22. Section 22(a) sets\nforth the “[g]eneral rule” that “State law shall apply to a\ncivil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related\ninjury or death.” §300aa–22(a). This baseline rule that\nstate law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one\nof which, §22(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)\nprovides:\n    “No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury\n    or death associated with the administration of a vac\n    cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re\n    sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\n    though the vaccine was properly prepared and was\n    accompanied by proper directions and warnings.”\n    §300aa–22(b)(1).\nThe provision contains two key clauses: “if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable”\n(the “if ” clause), and “even though the vaccine was prop\nerly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions\nand warnings” (the “even though” clause).\n   Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes\nthree different types of product defects: design defects,\nmanufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to\nwarn).1 The reference in the “even though” clause to a\n“properly prepared” vaccine “accompanied by proper direc\ntions and warnings” is an obvious reference to two such\ndefects—manufacturing and labeling defects. The plain\nterms of the “even though” clause thus indicate that\n——————\n  1 W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

Because §22(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur\ners as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the “even\nthough” clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each\ncivil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from\nmanufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the\nliability exemption of §22(b)(1).2\n   Given that the “even though” clause requires the ab\nsence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the “if ”\nclause’s reference to “side effects that were unavoidable”\nmust refer to side effects caused by something other than\nmanufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining\nkind of product defect recognized under traditional prod\nucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, “side effects\nthat were unavoidable” must refer to side effects caused by\na vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.” Because\n§22(b)(1) uses the conditional term “if,” moreover, the text\nplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a\nvaccine’s design are “unavoidable,” while others are avoid\nable. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1124 (2002) (“if ” means “in the event that,” “so long as,” or\n“on condition that”). Accordingly, because the “if ” clause\n(like the “even though” clause) sets forth a condition to\ninvoke §22(b)(1)’s defense to tort liability, Congress must\nalso have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate\nin each civil action that the particular side effects of a\nvaccine’s design were “unavoidable.”\n   Congress’ use of conditional “if” clauses in two other\nprovisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that\n§22(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a\nmanufacturer seeks to invoke the provision’s exception to\n——————\n    2 See Silkwood v.

In §22(b)(2), Congress created a pre\nsumption that, for purposes of §22(b)(1), “a vaccine shall\nbe presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and\nwarnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it com\nplied in all material respects with” federal labeling re\nquirements. 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(2). Similarly, in\n§23(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive\ndamages “[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied,\nin all material respects,” with applicable federal laws,\nunless it engages in “fraud,” “intentional and wrongful\nwithholding of information” from federal regulators, or\n“other criminal or illegal activity.” §300aa–23(d)(2). It\nwould be highly anomalous for Congress to use a condi\ntional “if ” clause in §§22(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a\nspecific inquiry in each case while using the same condi\ntional “if ” clause in §22(b)(1) to denote a categorical ex\nemption from liability. Cf. Erlenbaugh v. United States,\n409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972) (“[A] legislative body generally\nuses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a\ngiven context”).\n   Indeed, when Congress intends to pre-empt design\ndefect claims categorically, it does so using categorical\n(e.g., “all”) and/or declarative language (e.g., “shall”),\nrather than a conditional term (“if ”). For example, in\na related context, Congress has authorized the Secretary\nof Health and Human Services to designate a vaccine\ndesigned to prevent a pandemic or epidemic as a “covered\ncountermeasure.”         42 U. S. C. §§247d–6d(b), (i)(1),\n(i)(7)(A)(i). With respect to such “covered countermea\nsure[s],” Congress provided that subject to certain excep\ntions, “a covered person shall be immune from suit and\nliability under Federal and State law with respect to all\nclaims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or\nresulting from the administration to or the use by an\nindividual of a covered countermeasure,” §247d–6d(a)(1)\n(emphasis added), including specifically claims relating to\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

Contrary to the majority’s\nand respondent’s categorical reading, petitioners correctly\ncontend that, where a plaintiff has proved that she has\nsuffered an injury resulting from a side effect caused by\na vaccine’s design, a vaccine manufacturer may invoke\n§22(b)(1)’s liability exemption only if it demonstrates that\nthe side effect stemming from the particular vaccine’s\ndesign is “unavoidable,” and that the vaccine is otherwise\nfree from manufacturing and labeling defects.3\n                             B\n   The legislative history confirms petitioners’ interpreta\ntion of §22(b)(1) and sheds further light on its pre-emptive\nscope.

There are some products which, in\nthe present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being\nmade safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially\ncommon in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine\nfor the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to\nvery serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the\ndisease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing\nand the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the\nunavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product,\nproperly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning,\nis not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of\nmany other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very\nreason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the pre\nscription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or\nexperimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity\nfor sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or\nperhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is\njustifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically\nrecognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualifica\ntion that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning\nis given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict\nliability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely\nbecause he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently\nuseful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently\nreasonable risk.” Restatement 353–354.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

That intent, in turn, is manifested in the plain\ntext of §22(b)(1)—in particular, Congress’ use of the word\n“unavoidable,” as well as the phrases “properly prepared”\nand “accompanied by proper directions and warnings,”\nwhich were taken nearly verbatim from comment k. 42\nU.

To be sure, a number of courts at the time of the Vaccine Act’s\nenactment had interpreted comment k to preclude design defect claims\ncategorically for certain kinds of products, see Hill v. Searle Labs., 884\nF. 2d 1064, 1068 (CA8 1989) (collecting cases), but as indicated by the\nsources cited above, the courts that had construed comment k to apply\non a case-specific basis generally agreed on the basic elements of what\nconstituted an “unavoidably unsafe” product. See also n. 8, infra. The\nmajority’s suggestion that “judges who must rule on motions to dismiss,\nmotions for summary judgment, and motions for judgment as a matter\nof law” are incapable of adjudicating claims alleging “unavoidable” side\neffects, ante, at 7–8, n. 35, is thus belied by the experience of the many\ncourts that had adjudicated such claims for years by the time of the\nVaccine Act’s enactment.\n   6 The majority refuses to recognize that “unavoidable” is a term of art\n\nderived from comment k, suggesting that “ ‘[u]navoidable’ is hardly a\nrarely used word.” Ante, at 10.

The Report makes clear that “side effects\nthat were unavoidable” in §22(b)(1) refers to side effects\nstemming from a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.”\nBy explaining what Congress meant by the term “un\navoidable,” moreover, the Report also confirms that\nwhether a side effect is “unavoidable” for purposes of\n§22(b)(1) involves a specific inquiry in each case as to\nwhether the vaccine “in the present state of human skill\nand knowledge cannot be made safe,” 1986 Report 26—i.e.,\nwhether a feasible alternative design existed that would\nhave eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine\nwithout compromising its cost and utility.

When Con\ngress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially\ninclude a source of payment for the no-fault compensation\nprogram the Act established. The Act thus “made the\ncompensation program and accompanying tort reforms\ncontingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding\n——————\n   8 Respondent suggests an alternative reading of the 1986 Report.\n\nAccording to respondent, “the principle in Comment K” is simply that of\nnonliability for “unavoidably unsafe” products, and thus Congress’\nstated intent in the 1986 Report to apply the “principle in Comment K”\nto “the vaccines covered in the bill” means that Congress viewed the\ncovered vaccines as a class to be “ ‘unavoidably unsafe.’ ” 1986 Report\n25–26; Brief for Respondent 42. The concurrence makes a similar\nargument. Ante, at 1–2 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation\nfinds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that “if [injured\nindividuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a\nvaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im\nproper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom\npense in the compensation system, not the tort system.” 1986 Report\n26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which\nreflected considerable disagreement in the courts over “whether com\nment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on\na case-by-case basis.” Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and\nStrict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the\nSellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11\n(1989–1990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under\nmined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines\nfor optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20–22, and n. 19, and thus it\nseems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi\ntional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu\nlarly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see\n42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity\nas to how precisely Congress intended the “principle in Comment K” to\napply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in\npetitioners’ favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport, H. R. Rep. No. 100–391, pt. 1, pp. 690–691 (hereinafter 1987\nReport). See infra this page and 11–12.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

In 1987, Con\ngress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro\ngram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated\nthat “the codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement\n(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of\nlaw the circumstances in which a vaccine should be\ndeemed unavoidably unsafe.” Id., at 691. The Committee\nnoted that “[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manu\nfacturer’s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not\ngrounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during\nits original consideration of the Act.” Ibid. In light of that\nrejection, the Committee emphasized that “there should be\nno misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a\nmatter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe\nor not,” and that “[t]his question is left to the courts to\ndetermine in accordance with applicable law.” Ibid.\n   To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by\na subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis\nfrom which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.\nSee Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 631–632 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part). But unlike ordinary\npostenactment legislative history, which is justifiably\ngiven little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the\nintent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation\nnecessary to give operative effect to the principal provi\nsions of the Vaccine Act, including §22(b)(1).10 Congress in\n——————\n  9 The Third Circuit’s opinion below expressed uncertainty as to\n\nwhether the 1987 Report was authored by the House Budget Commit\ntee or the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Because the tort reforms in the 1986\nAct, including §22(b)(1), had no operative legal effect\nunless and until Congress provided funding for the com\npensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted\nthat funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authori\ntative guide to the meaning of §22(b)(1).

The difference, of course, is that appro\npriations legislation ordinarily funds congressional enactments that\nalready have operative legal effect; in contrast, operation of the tort\nreforms in the 1986 Act, including §22(b)(1), was expressly conditioned\non the enactment of a separate tax to fund the compensation program.\nSee §323(a), 100 Stat. 3784. Accordingly, this Court’s general reluc\ntance to view appropriations legislation as modifying substantive\nlegislation, see, e.g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U.

Accordingly, I believe §22(b)(1) exempts\nvaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a\nshowing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine\nwas properly manufactured and labeled, and that the side\neffects stemming from the vaccine’s design could not have\nbeen prevented by a feasible alternative design that would\nhave eliminated the adverse side effects without compro\nmising the vaccine’s cost and utility.\n                             II\n  In contrast to the interpretation of §22(b)(1) set forth\nabove, the majority’s interpretation does considerable vio\nlence to the statutory text, misconstrues the legislative\nhistory, and draws the wrong conclusions from the struc\nture of the Vaccine Act and the broader federal scheme\nregulating vaccines.\n                             A\n   As a textual matter, the majority’s interpretation of\n§22(b)(1) is fundamentally flawed in three central re\nspects. First, the majority’s categorical reading rests on a\nfaulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading func\ntionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including\nthe key term “unavoidable.” And third, the majority en\ntirely ignores the Vaccine Act’s default rule preserving\nstate tort law.\n   To begin, the majority states that “[a] side effect of a\nvaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a\ndifferently designed vaccine not containing the harmful\nelement.” Ante, at 7. From that premise, the majority\nconcludes that the statute must mean that “the design of\nthe vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort\naction,” because construing the statute otherwise would\n14                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrender §22(b)(1) a nullity. Ibid. A tort claimant, accord\ning to the majority, will always be able to point to a differ\nently designed vaccine not containing the “harmful ele\nment,” and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine’s\nside effects were not “unavoidable,” the statute would pre\nempt nothing.\n   The starting premise of the majority’s interpretation,\nhowever, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal\nsense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be\navoided “by use of a differently designed vaccine not con\ntaining the harmful element,” ibid., this interpretation of\n“unavoidable” would effectively read the term out of the\nstatute, and Congress could not have intended that result.\nIndeed, §22(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase\n“if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were\nunavoidable,” which plainly indicates that Congress con\ntemplated that there would be some instances in which a\nvaccine’s side effects are “unavoidable” and other in\nstances in which they are not. See supra, at 3. The major\nity’s premise that a vaccine’s side effects can always be\n“avoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element,” ante, at 7, entirely ig\nnores the fact that removing the “harmful element” will\noften result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective)\nvaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a\nkilled or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate\nantibody production;13 removing that bacteria or virus\nmight remove the “harmful element,” but it would also\nnecessarily render the vaccine inert. As explained above,\nthe legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases\ninterpreting comment k make clear that a side effect is\n\n——————\n  13 SeeAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Questions and Answers about\nVaccine Ingredients (Oct. 2008), http://www.aap.org/immunization/\nfamilies/faq/Vaccineingredients.pdf (all Internet materials as visited\nFeb. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

See supra, at 7. The majority’s premise—that\nside effects stemming from a vaccine’s design are always\navoidable—is thus belied by the statutory text and legisla\ntive history of §22(b)(1). And because its starting premise\nis invalid, its conclusion—that the design of a vaccine is\nnot subject to challenge in a tort action—is also necessar\nily invalid.\n    The majority’s reading suffers from an even more fun\ndamental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine\nmanufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil\nity, it more logically would have provided: “No vaccine\nmanufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages\narising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated\nwith the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,\nif the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\nby proper directions and warnings.” There would have\nbeen no need for Congress to include the additional 13\nwords “the injury or death resulted from side effects that\nwere unavoidable even though.” See TRW Inc. v.

S., at 448–449.\nAs with the statutory interpretation rejected by this Court\nin Bates, the majority’s interpretation of §22(b)(1) func\ntionally excises 13 words out of the statute, including the\nkey term “unavoidable.” See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.\n167, 174 (2001) (“We are especially unwilling” to treat a\nstatutory term as surplusage “when the term occupies so\npivotal a place in the statutory scheme”). Although the\nresulting “amputated version” of the statutory provision\n“would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded\nthe pre-emption of all state” design defect claims, the fact\n“[t]hat Congress added the remainder of the provision” is\nstrong evidence of its intent not to pre-empt design defect\nclaims categorically.

See\nante, at 12 (“The intervening passage (‘the injury or death\nresulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\nthough’) is unnecessary. True enough”). Nevertheless, the\nmajority contends that “the rule against giving a portion of\ntext an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . .\napplies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by\ngiving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text,\na competing interpretation.” Ibid. According to the major\nity, petitioners’ reading of §22(b)(1) renders the “even\nthough” clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners’\ndesired outcome, “[i]t would suffice to say ‘if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable’—\nfull stop.” Ibid. As explained above, however, the “even\nthough” clause establishes two additional prerequisites—\nproper manufacturing and proper labeling—to qualify for\n§22(b)(1)’s exemption from liability. Contrary to the ma\njority’s contention, then, the “even though” clause serves\nan important function by limiting the scope of the pre\nemption afforded by the preceding “if ” clause.14\n   The majority’s only other textual argument is based on\n——————\n   14 In this manner, the “even though” clause functions in a “concessive\n\nsubordinat[ing]” fashion, ante, at 11, in accord with normal grammati\ncal usage. According to the majority, however, the “even though” clause\n“clarifies the word that precedes it” by “delineat[ing]” the conditions\nthat make a side effect “unavoidable” under the statute. Ante, at 7.\nThe majority’s interpretation hardly treats the clause as “concessive,”\nand indeed strains the meaning of “even though.” In the majority’s\nview, proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that\nrender a vaccine’s side effects unavoidable. Thus, an injurious side\neffect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and\nlabeled, not “even though” it was. The two conjunctions are not equiva\nlent: The sentence “I am happy even though it is raining” can hardly be\nread to mean that “I am happy because it is raining.” In any event, the\nmore fundamental point is that petitioners’ interpretation actually\ngives meaning to the words “even though,” whereas the majority\nconcedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely\nout of the statute. See supra this page.\n18                   BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon. According to\nthe majority, because blackletter products liability law\ngenerally recognizes three different types of product de\nfects, “[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would\nbe strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only\ntwo”—namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the\n“even though” clause—“and leave the third to implication.”\nAnte, at 8. The majority’s argument, however, ignores\nthat the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state\nlaw is preserved. As explained above, §22(a) expressly\nprovides that the “[g]eneral rule” is that “State law shall\napply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine\nrelated injury or death.” 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). Be\ncause §22(a) already preserves state-law design defect\nclaims (to the extent the exemption in §22(b)(1) does not\napply), there was no need for Congress separately and\nexpressly to preserve design defect claims in §22(b)(1).\nIndeed, Congress’ principal aim in enacting §22(b)(1) was\nnot to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those,\ntoo, were already preserved by §22(a)), but rather, to\nfederalize comment k-type protection for “unavoidably\nunsafe” vaccines. The “even though” clause simply func\ntions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of\nexpress language in §22(b)(1) specifically preserving de\nsign defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as\nimpliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional\nstate tort claims, which had already been preserved by\n§22(a).15\n——————\n  15 This Court, moreover, has long operated on “the assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the\nFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.” Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Given the long\nhistory of state regulation of vaccines, see Brief for Petitioners 3–6, the\npresumption provides an additional reason not to read §22(b)(1) as pre\nempting all design defect claims, especially given Congress’ inclusion of\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Putting aside the fact that §22(a) already preserves\ndesign defect claims (to the extent §22(b)(1) does not ap\nply), the majority’s proposed solution would not have fully\neffectuated Congress’ intent. As the legislative history\nmakes clear, Congress used the term “unavoidable” to\neffectuate its intent that the “principle in Comment K\nregarding ‘unavoidably unsafe’ products . . . apply to the\nvaccines covered in the bill.” 1986 Report 26; see also\n1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act’s enact\nment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected\ncomment k,16 while many others had not addressed the\napplicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap\nplied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory\nother than strict liability (e.g., negligence17).

The principal thrust of the majority’s\nposition is that, since nothing in the Vaccine Act or the\nFDA’s regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions\ndesign defects, Congress must have intended to remove\nissues concerning the design of FDA-licensed vaccines\nfrom the tort system. Ante, at 13. The flaw in that rea\nsoning, of course, is that the FDA’s silence on design de\nfects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.\nIndeed, the majority itself concedes that the “FDA has\nnever even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to\ndecide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its in\ntended use.”18 Ibid. And yet it is undisputed that prior to\nthe Act, vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to\nliability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.\nThat the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehen\nsive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is\nthus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly\ndecided to change course sub silentio and pre-empt a\n——————\nnegligence”); Toner, 112 Idaho, at 340, 732 P. 2d, at 309–310 (“The\nauthorities universally agree that where a product is deemed unavoid\nably unsafe, the plaintiff is deprived of the advantage of a strict liabil\nity cause of action, but may proceed under a negligence cause of ac\ntion”).\n   18 See 42 U.

The Commit\ntee’s intent at the time of considering the Act . . . was . . .\nto leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as\nexpressly altered by the Act”).\n  The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily\nintended to pre-empt design defect claims since the aim of\nsuch tort suits is to promote the development of improved\ndesigns and provide compensation for injured individuals,\nand the Vaccine Act “provides other means for achieving\nboth effects”—most notably through the no-fault compen\nsation program and the National Vaccine Program.

But\nthe majority’s position elides a significant difference be\ntween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.\nAlthough the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services with the obligation to “promote the\ndevelopment of childhood vaccines” and “make or assure\nimprovements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,”\n§300aa–27(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of\nfederal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers\nto improve the design of their vaccines to account for\nscientific and technological advances.

As the legislative history indicates, the\nAct addressed “two overriding concerns”: “(a) the inade\nquacy—from both the perspective of vaccine-injured per\nsons as well as vaccine manufacturers—of the current\napproach to compensating those who have been damaged\nby a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of\nthe childhood vaccine market.” 1986 Report 7. When\nviewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole,\n§22(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme\nthat balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured\nchildren with added liability protections for vaccine manu\nfacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.\n  The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of\nthe no-fault compensation program—a scheme funded\nentirely through an excise tax on vaccines.22 Through that\n——————\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to displace a longstanding species\nof state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an\nexpress saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of\nstate-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law\nwould leave an important regulatory function—i.e., ensuring optimal\nvaccine design—entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.\n  22 The majority’s suggestion that “vaccine manufacturers fund from\n\ntheir sales” the compensation program is misleading.

The structure and legislative history,\nmoreover, point clearly to Congress’ intention to divert\nwould-be tort claimants into the compensation program,\nrather than eliminate a longstanding category of tradi\ntional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (“The Committee\nanticipates that the speed of the compensation program,\nthe low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault na\nture of the required findings, and the relative certainty\nand generosity of the system’s awards will divert a signifi\ncant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation”). In\ndeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would\nhave eliminated the principal source of the “unpredictabil\nity” in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose not\nto pre-empt state tort claims categorically. See 42 U. S. C.\n§300aa–22(a) (providing as a “[g]eneral rule” that “State\nlaw shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a\nvaccine-related injury or death”). That decision reflects\nCongress’ recognition that court actions are essential\n——————\nvaccines/programs/vfc/cdc-vac-price-list.htm. Accordingly, the only way\nthe vaccine manufacturers can be said to actually “fund” the compensa\ntion program is if the cost of the excise tax has an impact on the num\nber of vaccines sold by the vaccine manufacturer. The majority points\nto no evidence that the excise tax—which ordinarily amounts to 75\ncents per dose, 26 U. S. C. §4131(b)—has any impact whatsoever on the\ndemand for vaccines.\n   23 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (“Department of\n\nJustice records indicate that 99.8% of successful Compensation Pro\ngram claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort reme\ndies against vaccine manufacturers”); S.

See §§300aa–\n12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3). Congress thus clearly believed there\nwas still an important function to be played by state tort\nlaw.\n   Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,\nCongress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac\nturers’ liability exposure, including a limited regulatory\ncompliance presumption of adequate warnings, see\n§300aa–22(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure\nto provide direct warnings to patients, §300aa–22(c), a\nheightened standard for punitive damages, §300aa–\n23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for “un\navoidable” side effects, §300aa–22(b)(1). Considered in\nlight of the Vaccine Act as a whole, §22(b)(1)’s exemption\nfrom liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one\npart of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress’\ncareful balance between providing adequate compensation\nfor vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial\nbenefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and\npredictable childhood vaccine supply.\n   The majority’s decision today disturbs that careful\nbalance based on a bare policy preference that it is better\n“to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine\ndesign to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program\nrather than juries.” Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable\nminds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries\nweigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac\ncine design.

But these rulings do highlight the sub\nstantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See Schafer v. American\nCyanamid Co., 20 F. 3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (“[A] petitioner to whom the\nVaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort\nlaw’s yet more serious obstacles to recovery”). Trial courts, moreover,\nhave considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of\nmeritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (in\ncluding for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led\nto shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of\nrespondent and the various amici cited by the concurrence, ante, at 6–7,\nthe possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufac\nturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More\nfundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the\nissue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question,\nthe text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that\nCongress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who\nhave suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The\nmajority’s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress’ role\nand deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Con\ngress intended them to have.\n28               BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npre-empt all design defect claims against vaccine manu\nfacturers for covered vaccines, the majority’s decision\nleaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one—neither the\nFDA nor any other federal agency, nor state and federal\njuries—ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately\ntake account of scientific and technological advancements.\nThis concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines\nthat have already been released and marketed to the\npublic. Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competi\ntion in the vaccine market, will often have little or no\nincentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are al\nready generating significant profit margins. Nothing in\nthe text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests\nthat Congress intended that result.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 205203, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/02/22/Bruesewitz_v._Wyeth_LLC.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 12, 2010—Decided February 22, 2011\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) cre\n  ated a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market\n  adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation\n  and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing le\n  gitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult. The Act\n  provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a peti\n  tion for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the\n  Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the\n  court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the\n  claimant can then decide whether to accept the court’s judgment or\n  reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer. Awards\n  are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.\n  As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability pro\n  tections. Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability\n  for a vaccine’s unavoidable, adverse side effects.\n     Hannah Bruesewitz’s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the\n  Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled af\n  ter receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine\n  manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent\n  Wyeth). After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the\n  unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, al\n  leging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederle’s DTP vaccine\n  caused Hannah’s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict\n  liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania com\n  mon law. Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court. It\n  granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Penn\n  sylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), which\n2                     BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    provides that “[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death asso\n    ciated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if\n    the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable\n    even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\n    by proper directions and warnings.” The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine\n manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury\n or death caused by a vaccine’s side effects. Pp. 7–19.\n    (a) Section 300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests that a vaccine’s design is\n not open to question in a tort action. If a manufacturer could be held\n liable for failure to use a different design, the “even though” clause\n would do no work. A vaccine side effect could always have been\n avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful\n element. The language of the provision thus suggests the design is\n not subject to question in a tort action. What the statute establishes\n as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufac\n ture and warning) with respect to the particular design. This conclu\n sion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law es\n tablishes three grounds for liability—defective manufacture,\n inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design—the Act\n mentions only manufacture and warnings. It thus seems that the\n Act’s failure to mention design-defect liability is “by deliberate choice,\n not inadvertence.” Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.\n Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Contrary to petitioners’ argument, there is no reason to believe\n that §300aa–22(b)(1)’s term “unavoidable” is a term of art incorporat\n ing Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A, Comment k, which exempts\n from strict liability rules “unavoidably unsafe products.” “Unavoid\n able” is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k\n attach special significance only to the term “unavoidably unsafe\n products,” not the word “unavoidable” standing alone. Moreover,\n reading the phrase “side effects that were unavoidable” to exempt in\n juries caused by flawed design would require treating “even though”\n as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a\n concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause\n weakens or qualifies the other. The canon against superfluity does\n not undermine this Court’s interpretation because petitioners’ com\n peting interpretation has superfluity problems of its own. Pp. 8–12.\n    (c) The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general\n reinforces what §300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests. Design defects do\n not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Admini\n stration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufactur\n ing process. This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men\n  tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men\n  tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act’s mandates\n  lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve\n  ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,\n  which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de\n  sign-defect torts—prompting the development of improved designs,\n  and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act’s struc\n  tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine\n  manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for\n  vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the\n  occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund\n  the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de\n  fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar\n  ket.

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncines became, one might say, victims of their own success.\nThey had been so effective in preventing infectious dis\neases that the public became much less alarmed at the\nthreat of those diseases,4 and much more concerned with\nthe risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.5\n   Much of the concern centered around vaccines against\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were\nblamed for children’s disabilities and developmental de\nlays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort\nlitigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine\nproduct-liability suits were filed against DTP manufactur\ners, by the mid-1980’s the suits numbered more than 200\neach year.6 This destabilized the DTP vaccine market,\ncausing two of the three domestic manufacturers to with\ndraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laborato\nries, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its\nannual sales by a factor of 200.7 Vaccine shortages arose\nwhen Lederle had production problems in 1984.8\n   Despite the large number of suits, there were many\ncomplaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate\nvaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.9 A\n——————\n   4 See Mortimer, Immunization Against Infectious Disease, 200 Sci\n\nence 902, 906 (1978).\n   5 See National Vaccine Advisory Committee, A Comprehensive Re\n\nview of Federal Vaccine Safety Programs and Public Health Activities\n2–3 (Dec. 2008) (hereinafter NVAC), http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/\ndocuments/vaccine-safety-review.pdf (as visited Feb. 18, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n   6 See Sing & Willian, Supplying Vaccines: An Overview of the Market\n\nand Regulatory Context, in Supplying Vaccines: An Economic Analysis\nof Critical Issues 45, 51–52 (M.

The Act estab\nlishes a no-fault compensation program “designed to work\nfaster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.”\nShalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U. S. 268, 269 (1995). A per\nson injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a\npetition for compensation in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services as the respondent.13 A special master\nthen makes an informal adjudication of the petition within\n(except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.14 The Court\nof Federal Claims must review objections to the special\nmaster’s decision and enter final judgment under a simi\nlarly tight statutory deadline.15 At that point, a claimant\nhas two options: to accept the court’s judgment and forgo a\ntraditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment\nand seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.16\n   Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act’s\nVaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered\nunder the Act; describes each vaccine’s compensable,\n\n——————\nLawsuits, and Legal Rights: The Battle over Litigation in American\nSociety 146 (2002).\n  10 Mortimer, supra, at 906.\n  11 See Hagan, 45 Food Drug Cosm.

The Bruesewitzes\nelected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October\n2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their\ncomplaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design\nof Lederle’s DTP vaccine caused Hannah’s disabilities, and\nthat Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for\nnegligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.31\n   Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which\ngranted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability\nand negligence design-defect claims, holding that the\nPennsylvania law providing those causes of action was\npreempted by 42 U.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine\nmanufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con\nsidered “unavoidable” under the statute. Provided that\nthere was proper manufacture and warning, any remain\ning side effects, including those resulting from design\ndefects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law\ndesign-defect claims are therefore preempted.\n   If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a\ndifferent design, the word “unavoidable” would do no\nwork. A side effect of a vaccine could always have been\navoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element. The language of the\nprovision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a\ngiven, not subject to question in the tort action. What the\nstatute establishes as a complete defense must be un\navoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with\nrespect to the particular design. Which plainly implies\nthat the design itself is not open to question.35\n——————\n  34 42U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1).\n  35 The dissent advocates for another possibility: “[A] side effect is\n‘unavoidable’ . . . where there is no feasible alternative design that\nwould eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its\ncost and utility.” Post, at 15 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).

WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   A further textual indication leads to the same conclu\nsion. Products-liability law establishes a classic and well\nknown triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective\nmanufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and\ndefective design.36 If all three were intended to be pre\nserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only\ntwo, and leave the third to implication. It would have\nbeen much easier (and much more natural) to provide that\nmanufacturers would be liable for “defective manufacture,\ndefective directions or warning, and defective design.” It\nseems that the statute fails to mention design-defect\nliability “by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.” Barn\nhart v.

We have no idea how much more expensive an\nalternative design can be before it “compromis[es]” a vaccine’s cost or\nhow much efficacy an alternative design can sacrifice to improve safety.\nNeither does the dissent. And neither will the judges who must rule on\nmotions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and motions for\njudgment as a matter of law.

The “if ” clause\nmakes total sense whether the design to which “unavoid\nable” refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design\n(making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine\nat issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design\nused for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects un\navoidable). Under the latter view, the condition estab\nlished by the “if” clause is that the vaccine have been\nproperly labeled and manufactured; and under the former,\nthat it have been properly designed, labeled, and manufac\ntured. Neither view renders the “if ” clause a nullity.\nWhich of the two variants must be preferred is addressed\nby our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by\nthe “if ” clause.\n   Petitioners’ and the dissent’s textual argument also\nrests upon the proposition that the word “unavoidable” in\n§300aa–22(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates com\nment k to Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1963–\n1964).39 The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer\nstrictly liable for harm to person or property caused by\n“any product in a defective condition unreasonably dan\ngerous to the user.”40 Comment k exempts from this\nstrict-liability rule “unavoidably unsafe products.” An\nunavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of\ncriteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies\nvaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this\nlack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the\ncomment k analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of\ncourts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an\n“unavoidably unsafe product”: a case-specific showing that\nthe product was “quite incapable of being made safer for\n\n\n——————\n 38 Ibid.\n 39 See   Brief for Petitioners 29.\n\n 40 Restatement     §402A, p. 347. \n\n10                   BRUESEWITZ v.

The comment creates a\nspecial category of “unavoidably unsafe products,” while\nthe statute refers to “side effects that were unavoidable.”\nThat the latter uses the adjective “unavoidable” and the\nformer the adverb “unavoidably” does not establish that\nCongress had comment k in mind. “Unavoidable” is\nhardly a rarely used word.

The phrase “even though” in the clause\n“even though the vaccine was properly prepared and\n[labeled]” is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable\nside effects persist despite best manufacturing and label\ning practices.43 But petitioners’ reading eliminates any\nopposition between the “even though” clause—called a\nconcessive subordinate clause by grammarians—and the\nword “unavoidable.”44 Their reading makes preemption\nturn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and\nproper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the\nrequirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as\n“two additional prerequisites” for preemption independent\nof unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for\nthe dissent’s position depends on that independence.46\nBut linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating\njunction like “and,” not a subordinating junction like “even\nthough.”47\n——————\n  43 The dissent’s assertion that we treat “even though” as a synonym\n\nfor “because” misses the subtle distinction between “because” and\n“despite.” See post, at 17, n. 14. “Even though” is a close cousin of the\nlatter. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.\n1957). The statement “the car accident was unavoidable despite his\nquick reflexes” indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci\ndent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un\nstated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,\nbut came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only\npossible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of §300aa–\n22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this\ncontext. (Incidentally, the statement “the car accident was unavoidable\nbecause of his quick reflexes” makes no sense.)\n  44 See W. Follett, Modern American Usage: A Guide 61 (1966).\n  45 Post, at 9, 17.\n  46 Post, at 3–5.\n  47 The dissent responds that these “additional prerequisites” act “in a\n\nconcessive, subordinating fashion,” post, at 17, n. 14 (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But that is no more true of the dissent’s\nconjunctive interpretation of the present text than it is of all provisions\nthat set forth additional requirements—meaning that we could elimi\nnate “even though” from our English lexicon, its function being entirely\n12                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpreta\ntion we propose would render part of §300aa–22(b)(1)\nsuperfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more\nclearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability\n“if . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accom\npanied by proper directions and warnings.” The interven\ning passage (“the injury or death resulted from side effects\nthat were unavoidable even though”) is unnecessary. True\nenough. But the rule against giving a portion of text an\ninterpretation which renders it superfluous does not pre\nscribe that a passage which could have been more terse\ndoes not mean what it says. The rule applies only if ver\nbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend\ning passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing\ninterpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,\npetitioners’ and the dissent’s interpretation gives inde\npendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed\nmeaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense\nof rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.\nSince a vaccine is not “quite incapable of being made safer\nfor [its] intended use” if manufacturing defects could have\nbeen eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire\n“even though” clause is a useless appendage.49 It would\nsuffice to say “if the injury or death resulted from side\neffects that were unavoidable”—full stop.\n\n——————\nperformed by “and.” No, we think “even though” has a distinctive\nconcessive, subordinating role to play.\n  48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli\n\nance on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), is mis\nplaced. See id., at 449 (adopting an interpretation that was “the only\none that makes sense of each phrase” in the relevant statute).\n  49 That is true regardless of whether §300aa–22(b)(1) incorporates\n\ncomment k.

A vaccine’s license spells out the manufacturing\nmethod that must be followed and the directions and\nwarnings that must accompany the product.50 Manufac\nturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Admini\nstration’s (FDA) approval before modifying either.51 De\nviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of\nmanufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further\nobjective evidence comes from the FDA’s regulations—\nmore than 90 of them52—that pervasively regulate the\nmanufacturing process, down to the requirements for\nplumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing\nfacility.53 Material noncompliance with any one of them,\nor with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufac\nturer its regulatory-compliance defense.54\n   Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single men\ntion in the NCVIA or the FDA’s regulations. Indeed, the\nFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria\nit uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for\nits intended use.55 And the decision is surely not an easy\none. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less\nefficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not\nalways the best one. Striking the right balance between\nsafety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to\nvaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.\nYet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages\nmanufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing\ndesigns.

Or\ndoes it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in\nother countries? Or could there be liability for failure to\nuse a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor\nthe FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the uni\nverse of alternative designs to be limited only by an ex\npert’s imagination.\n   Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with\nlittle guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence\nof guidance alone suggests preemption. But the lack of\nguidance for design defects combined with the exten-\nsive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically\nmentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects\nwere not mentioned because they are not a basis for\nliability.\n   The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same\nconclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have\ntwo beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of\nimproved designs, and (2) providing compensation for\ninflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for\nachieving both effects. We have already discussed the\nAct’s generous compensation scheme. And the Act pro\nvides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote\n“the development of childhood vaccines that result in\nfewer and less serious adverse reactions.”57 It establishes\na National Vaccine Program, whose Director is “to achieve\noptimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to\nachieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.”58\nThe Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine re\nsearch, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and effi\n——————\n 56 See Sing & William, Supplying Vaccines, at 66–67.\n 57 42 U.

It instead\nreflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological\njudgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the Na\ntional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63\n   And finally, the Act’s structural quid pro quo leads to\nthe same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund\nfrom their sales an informal, efficient compensation pro\ngram for vaccine injuries;64 in exchange they avoid costly\ntort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury\nverdict.65 But design-defect allegations are the most\nspeculative and difficult type of products liability claim to\n——————\n  59 See §§300aa–2(a)(1)–(3), 300aa–3.\n  60 See §300aa–25(b).\n  61 See NVAC 18–19.\n  62 See 21 CFR §601.5(b)(1)(vi) (2010).\n  63 The dissent quotes just part of this sentence, to make it appear that\n\nwe believe complex epidemiological judgments ought to be assigned in\nthat fashion.

The dissent’s unsupported speculation that demand in the\nvaccine market is inelastic, see post, at 24, n. 22, sheds no light on\nwhether Congress regarded the tax as a quid pro quo, most Members of\nCongress being neither professional economists nor law-and-economics\nscholars.\n  65 See 42 U.

Taxing vaccine manufacturers’ product to fund\nthe compensation program, while leaving their liability for\ndesign defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax\nmanufacturers back into the market.\n   The dissent believes the Act’s mandates are irrelevant\nbecause they do not spur innovation in precisely the same\nway as state-law tort systems.66 That is a novel sugges\ntion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that\nCongress would quietly preempt product-liability claims\nwithout providing a federal substitute, see Medtronic, Inc.\nv. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 486–488 (1996) (plurality opinion),\nwe have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemp\ntion unless the congressional substitute operated like the\ntort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The\ndissent’s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine\nProgram cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is\nprobably questionable, but surely beside the point.\n                              IV\n  Since our interpretation of §300aa–22(b)(1) is the only\ninterpretation supported by the text and structure of the\nNCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is\na legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need\nto resort to it. In any case, the dissent’s contention that it\nwould contradict our conclusion is mistaken.\n  The dissent’s legislative history relies on the following\nsyllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that\n§300aa–22(b)(1) “sets forth the principle contained in\nComment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts\n(Second);”67 in 1986 comment k was “commonly under\nstood” to require a case-specific showing that “no feasible\nalternative design” existed; Congress therefore must have\nintended §300aa–22(b)(1) to require that showing.68 The\n——————\n 66 See post, at 21–24. \n\n 67 H.R.

Because the Report believes that §300aa–\n22(b)(1) should incorporate “the principle in Comment K”\nand because the Act provides a generous no-fault compen\nsation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who\ncannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to “pursue\nrecompense in the compensation system, not the tort\nsystem.”71 That counsel echoes our interpretation of\n§300aa–22(b)(1).\n   Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by\na later Congress “authoritative[ly]” vindicates its interpre\ntation.72 Post-enactment legislative history (a contradic\ntion in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpre\ntation.

But post-enactment legislative history by defini\ntion “could have had no effect on the congressional vote,”\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 605 (2008).\n   It does not matter that §300aa–22(b)(1) did not take\neffect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that\nfunds the compensation scheme,73 and that the supposedly\ndispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding\nlegislation.74 Those who voted on the relevant statutory\nlanguage were not necessarily the same persons who\ncrafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if\nthey were did not necessarily have the same views at that\nearlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could\npossibly have been informed by those later statements.\nPermitting the legislative history of subsequent funding\nlegislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a\ndangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law\ndepend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;75\nthey cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory\nrevision.\n   That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent’s syllo\ngism: Comment k did not have a “commonly understood\nmeaning”76 in the mid-1980’s.

In my view,\nthe Court has the better of the purely textual argument.\nBut the textual question considered alone is a close\none. Hence, like the dissent, I would look to other\nsources, including legislative history, statutory purpose,\nand the views of the federal administrative agency, here\nsupported by expert medical opinion. Unlike the dissent,\nhowever, I believe these other sources reinforce the\nCourt’s conclusion.\n                            I\n   House Committee Report 99–908 contains an “authori\ntative” account of Congress’ intent in drafting the pre\nemption clause of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury\nAct of 1986 (NCVIA or Act). See Garcia v. United States,\n469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (“[T]he authoritative source for\nfinding the Legislature’s intent lies in the Committee\nReports on the bill”). That Report says that, “if” vaccine\ninjured persons\n    “cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that\n    a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was ac\n    companied by improper directions or inadequate\n    warnings [they] should pursue recompense in the\n2                BRUESEWITZ v.

R.\n    Rep.).\nThe Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the\nclause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manu\nfacturing and improper labeling), while going on to state\nthat compensation for other tort claims, e.g., design-defect\nclaims, lies in “the [NCVIA’s no-fault] compensation sys\ntem, not the tort system.” Ibid.\n   The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Re\nport’s earlier description of the statute as “set[ting] forth\nthe principle contained in Comment k” (of the Restate\nment Second of Torts’ strict liability section, 402A) that “a\nvaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or\ndeaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.” Id., at 23\n(emphasis added). But the appearance of the word “un\navoidable” in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide\npetitioners with much help. That is because nothing in\nthe Report suggests that the statute means the word\n“unavoidable” to summon up an otherwise unmentioned\nthird exception encompassing suits based on design de\nfects. Nor can the Report’s reference to comment k fill the\ngap. The Report itself refers, not to comment k’s details,\nbut only to its “principle,” namely, that vaccine manufac\nturers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.\nIt says nothing at all about who—judge, jury, or federal\nsafety agency—should decide whether a safer vaccine\ncould have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress\nwrote this Report, different state courts had come to very\ndifferent conclusions about that matter. See Cupp, Re\nthinking Conscious Design Liability for Prescription\nDrugs: The Restatement (Third) Standard Versus a Negli\ngence Approach, 63 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 76, 79 (1994–1995)\n(“[C]ourts [had] adopted a broad range of conflicting inter\npretations” of comment k). Neither the word “unavoid\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Silence\ncannot tell us to follow those States where juries decided\nthe design-defect question.\n                             II\n  The legislative history describes the statute more gen\nerally as trying to protect the lives of children, in part\nby ending “the instability and unpredictability of the\nchildhood vaccine market.” H.

Id., at 5, 24.\n   Given these broad general purposes, to read the pre\nemption clause as preserving design-defect suits seems\nanomalous. The Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) decides when a vaccine is safe enough to\nbe licensed and which licensed vaccines, with which\nassociated injuries, should be placed on the Vaccine In-\njury Table. 42 U.

A special master in the Act’s\ncompensation program determines whether someone has\nsuffered an injury listed on the Injury Table and, if not,\nwhether the vaccine nonetheless caused the injury. Ante,\nat 3–4; §300aa–13. To allow a jury in effect to second\nguess those determinations is to substitute less expert for\nmore expert judgment, thereby threatening manufacturers\nwith liability (indeed, strict liability) in instances where\nany conflict between experts and nonexperts is likely to be\nparticularly severe—instances where Congress intended\nthe contrary. That is because potential tort plaintiffs are\nunlikely to bring suit unless the specialized compensation\nprogram has determined that they are not entitled to\ncompensation (say, because it concludes that the vaccine\ndid not cause the injury).

It\nsays that to read the Act as permitting design-defect\nlawsuits could lead to a recurrence of “exactly the crisis\nthat precipitated the Act,” namely withdrawals of vaccines\nor vaccine manufacturers from the market, “disserv[ing]\nthe Act’s central purposes,” and hampering the ability of\nthe agency’s “expert regulators, in conjunction with the\nmedical community, [to] control the availability and with\ndrawal of a given vaccine.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 30, 31.\n   The United States is supported in this claim by leading\npublic health organizations, including the American Acad\nemy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Phy\nsicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the\nAmerican Public Health Association, the American Medi\ncal Association, the March of Dimes Foundation, the Pedi\natric Infectious Diseases Society, and 15 other similar\norganizations.

But it nonetheless\ntells us here, in respect to the specific question before us,\nthat the petitioners’ interpretation of the Act would un\ndermine its basic purposes by threatening to “halt the\nfuture production and development of childhood vaccines\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

HHS’s position is par\nticularly persuasive here because expert public health\norganizations support its views and the matter concerns a\nmedical and scientific question of great importance: how\nbest to save the lives of children. See Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U.

Until today, that duty was\nenforceable through a traditional state-law tort action for\ndefective design. In holding that §22(b)(1) of the National\nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act),\n42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), pre-empts all design defect\nclaims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under\nthe Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference\nover the considered judgment of Congress. In doing so,\nthe Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, mis\nconstrues the Act’s legislative history, and disturbs the\ncareful balance Congress struck between compensating\nvaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood\nvaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum\nin which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers ade\nquately take account of scientific and technological ad\nvancements when designing or distributing their products.\nBecause nothing in the text, structure, or legislative his\ntory of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress\nintended such a result, I respectfully dissent.\n2                  BRUESEWITZ v.

S. C. §300aa–22. Section 22(a) sets\nforth the “[g]eneral rule” that “State law shall apply to a\ncivil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related\ninjury or death.” §300aa–22(a). This baseline rule that\nstate law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one\nof which, §22(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)\nprovides:\n    “No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac\n    tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury\n    or death associated with the administration of a vac\n    cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re\n    sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\n    though the vaccine was properly prepared and was\n    accompanied by proper directions and warnings.”\n    §300aa–22(b)(1).\nThe provision contains two key clauses: “if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable”\n(the “if ” clause), and “even though the vaccine was prop\nerly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions\nand warnings” (the “even though” clause).\n   Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes\nthree different types of product defects: design defects,\nmanufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to\nwarn).1 The reference in the “even though” clause to a\n“properly prepared” vaccine “accompanied by proper direc\ntions and warnings” is an obvious reference to two such\ndefects—manufacturing and labeling defects. The plain\nterms of the “even though” clause thus indicate that\n——————\n  1 W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D.

Because §22(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur\ners as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the “even\nthough” clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each\ncivil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from\nmanufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the\nliability exemption of §22(b)(1).2\n   Given that the “even though” clause requires the ab\nsence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the “if ”\nclause’s reference to “side effects that were unavoidable”\nmust refer to side effects caused by something other than\nmanufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining\nkind of product defect recognized under traditional prod\nucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, “side effects\nthat were unavoidable” must refer to side effects caused by\na vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.” Because\n§22(b)(1) uses the conditional term “if,” moreover, the text\nplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a\nvaccine’s design are “unavoidable,” while others are avoid\nable. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1124 (2002) (“if ” means “in the event that,” “so long as,” or\n“on condition that”). Accordingly, because the “if ” clause\n(like the “even though” clause) sets forth a condition to\ninvoke §22(b)(1)’s defense to tort liability, Congress must\nalso have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate\nin each civil action that the particular side effects of a\nvaccine’s design were “unavoidable.”\n   Congress’ use of conditional “if” clauses in two other\nprovisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that\n§22(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a\nmanufacturer seeks to invoke the provision’s exception to\n——————\n    2 See Silkwood v.

In §22(b)(2), Congress created a pre\nsumption that, for purposes of §22(b)(1), “a vaccine shall\nbe presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and\nwarnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it com\nplied in all material respects with” federal labeling re\nquirements. 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(2). Similarly, in\n§23(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive\ndamages “[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied,\nin all material respects,” with applicable federal laws,\nunless it engages in “fraud,” “intentional and wrongful\nwithholding of information” from federal regulators, or\n“other criminal or illegal activity.” §300aa–23(d)(2). It\nwould be highly anomalous for Congress to use a condi\ntional “if ” clause in §§22(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a\nspecific inquiry in each case while using the same condi\ntional “if ” clause in §22(b)(1) to denote a categorical ex\nemption from liability. Cf. Erlenbaugh v. United States,\n409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972) (“[A] legislative body generally\nuses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a\ngiven context”).\n   Indeed, when Congress intends to pre-empt design\ndefect claims categorically, it does so using categorical\n(e.g., “all”) and/or declarative language (e.g., “shall”),\nrather than a conditional term (“if ”). For example, in\na related context, Congress has authorized the Secretary\nof Health and Human Services to designate a vaccine\ndesigned to prevent a pandemic or epidemic as a “covered\ncountermeasure.”         42 U. S. C. §§247d–6d(b), (i)(1),\n(i)(7)(A)(i). With respect to such “covered countermea\nsure[s],” Congress provided that subject to certain excep\ntions, “a covered person shall be immune from suit and\nliability under Federal and State law with respect to all\nclaims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or\nresulting from the administration to or the use by an\nindividual of a covered countermeasure,” §247d–6d(a)(1)\n(emphasis added), including specifically claims relating to\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

Contrary to the majority’s\nand respondent’s categorical reading, petitioners correctly\ncontend that, where a plaintiff has proved that she has\nsuffered an injury resulting from a side effect caused by\na vaccine’s design, a vaccine manufacturer may invoke\n§22(b)(1)’s liability exemption only if it demonstrates that\nthe side effect stemming from the particular vaccine’s\ndesign is “unavoidable,” and that the vaccine is otherwise\nfree from manufacturing and labeling defects.3\n                             B\n   The legislative history confirms petitioners’ interpreta\ntion of §22(b)(1) and sheds further light on its pre-emptive\nscope.

The same is true of\nmany other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very\nreason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the pre\nscription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or\nexperimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity\nfor sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or\nperhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is\njustifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically\nrecognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualifica\ntion that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning\nis given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict\nliability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely\nbecause he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently\nuseful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently\nreasonable risk.” Restatement 353–354.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

The Report makes clear that “side effects\nthat were unavoidable” in §22(b)(1) refers to side effects\nstemming from a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.”\nBy explaining what Congress meant by the term “un\navoidable,” moreover, the Report also confirms that\nwhether a side effect is “unavoidable” for purposes of\n§22(b)(1) involves a specific inquiry in each case as to\nwhether the vaccine “in the present state of human skill\nand knowledge cannot be made safe,” 1986 Report 26—i.e.,\nwhether a feasible alternative design existed that would\nhave eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine\nwithout compromising its cost and utility.

The concurrence makes a similar\nargument. Ante, at 1–2 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation\nfinds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that “if [injured\nindividuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a\nvaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im\nproper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom\npense in the compensation system, not the tort system.” 1986 Report\n26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which\nreflected considerable disagreement in the courts over “whether com\nment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on\na case-by-case basis.” Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and\nStrict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the\nSellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11\n(1989–1990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under\nmined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines\nfor optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20–22, and n. 19, and thus it\nseems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi\ntional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu\nlarly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see\n42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity\nas to how precisely Congress intended the “principle in Comment K” to\napply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in\npetitioners’ favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport, H. R. Rep. No. 100–391, pt. 1, pp. 690–691 (hereinafter 1987\nReport). See infra this page and 11–12.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

In 1987, Con\ngress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro\ngram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nReport9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated\nthat “the codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement\n(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of\nlaw the circumstances in which a vaccine should be\ndeemed unavoidably unsafe.” Id., at 691. The Committee\nnoted that “[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manu\nfacturer’s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not\ngrounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during\nits original consideration of the Act.” Ibid. In light of that\nrejection, the Committee emphasized that “there should be\nno misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a\nmatter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe\nor not,” and that “[t]his question is left to the courts to\ndetermine in accordance with applicable law.” Ibid.\n   To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by\na subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis\nfrom which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.\nSee Sullivan v.

Accordingly, this Court’s general reluc\ntance to view appropriations legislation as modifying substantive\nlegislation, see, e.g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U.

First, the majority’s categorical reading rests on a\nfaulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading func\ntionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including\nthe key term “unavoidable.” And third, the majority en\ntirely ignores the Vaccine Act’s default rule preserving\nstate tort law.\n   To begin, the majority states that “[a] side effect of a\nvaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a\ndifferently designed vaccine not containing the harmful\nelement.” Ante, at 7. From that premise, the majority\nconcludes that the statute must mean that “the design of\nthe vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort\naction,” because construing the statute otherwise would\n14                 BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrender §22(b)(1) a nullity. Ibid. A tort claimant, accord\ning to the majority, will always be able to point to a differ\nently designed vaccine not containing the “harmful ele\nment,” and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine’s\nside effects were not “unavoidable,” the statute would pre\nempt nothing.\n   The starting premise of the majority’s interpretation,\nhowever, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal\nsense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be\navoided “by use of a differently designed vaccine not con\ntaining the harmful element,” ibid., this interpretation of\n“unavoidable” would effectively read the term out of the\nstatute, and Congress could not have intended that result.\nIndeed, §22(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase\n“if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were\nunavoidable,” which plainly indicates that Congress con\ntemplated that there would be some instances in which a\nvaccine’s side effects are “unavoidable” and other in\nstances in which they are not. See supra, at 3. The major\nity’s premise that a vaccine’s side effects can always be\n“avoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not\ncontaining the harmful element,” ante, at 7, entirely ig\nnores the fact that removing the “harmful element” will\noften result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective)\nvaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a\nkilled or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate\nantibody production;13 removing that bacteria or virus\nmight remove the “harmful element,” but it would also\nnecessarily render the vaccine inert. As explained above,\nthe legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases\ninterpreting comment k make clear that a side effect is\n\n——————\n  13 SeeAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Questions and Answers about\nVaccine Ingredients (Oct. 2008), http://www.aap.org/immunization/\nfamilies/faq/Vaccineingredients.pdf (all Internet materials as visited\nFeb. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

See supra, at 7. The majority’s premise—that\nside effects stemming from a vaccine’s design are always\navoidable—is thus belied by the statutory text and legisla\ntive history of §22(b)(1). And because its starting premise\nis invalid, its conclusion—that the design of a vaccine is\nnot subject to challenge in a tort action—is also necessar\nily invalid.\n    The majority’s reading suffers from an even more fun\ndamental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine\nmanufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil\nity, it more logically would have provided: “No vaccine\nmanufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages\narising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated\nwith the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,\nif the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\nby proper directions and warnings.” There would have\nbeen no need for Congress to include the additional 13\nwords “the injury or death resulted from side effects that\nwere unavoidable even though.” See TRW Inc. v. An\ndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting “cardinal principle\nof statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the\nwhole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no\nclause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or\ninsignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n    In Bates v.

Walker, 533 U. S.\n167, 174 (2001) (“We are especially unwilling” to treat a\nstatutory term as surplusage “when the term occupies so\npivotal a place in the statutory scheme”). Although the\nresulting “amputated version” of the statutory provision\n“would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded\nthe pre-emption of all state” design defect claims, the fact\n“[t]hat Congress added the remainder of the provision” is\nstrong evidence of its intent not to pre-empt design defect\nclaims categorically.

See\nante, at 12 (“The intervening passage (‘the injury or death\nresulted from side effects that were unavoidable even\nthough’) is unnecessary. True enough”). Nevertheless, the\nmajority contends that “the rule against giving a portion of\ntext an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . .\napplies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by\ngiving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text,\na competing interpretation.” Ibid. According to the major\nity, petitioners’ reading of §22(b)(1) renders the “even\nthough” clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners’\ndesired outcome, “[i]t would suffice to say ‘if the injury or\ndeath resulted from side effects that were unavoidable’—\nfull stop.” Ibid. As explained above, however, the “even\nthough” clause establishes two additional prerequisites—\nproper manufacturing and proper labeling—to qualify for\n§22(b)(1)’s exemption from liability. Contrary to the ma\njority’s contention, then, the “even though” clause serves\nan important function by limiting the scope of the pre\nemption afforded by the preceding “if ” clause.14\n   The majority’s only other textual argument is based on\n——————\n   14 In this manner, the “even though” clause functions in a “concessive\n\nsubordinat[ing]” fashion, ante, at 11, in accord with normal grammati\ncal usage. According to the majority, however, the “even though” clause\n“clarifies the word that precedes it” by “delineat[ing]” the conditions\nthat make a side effect “unavoidable” under the statute. Ante, at 7.\nThe majority’s interpretation hardly treats the clause as “concessive,”\nand indeed strains the meaning of “even though.” In the majority’s\nview, proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that\nrender a vaccine’s side effects unavoidable. Thus, an injurious side\neffect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and\nlabeled, not “even though” it was. The two conjunctions are not equiva\nlent: The sentence “I am happy even though it is raining” can hardly be\nread to mean that “I am happy because it is raining.” In any event, the\nmore fundamental point is that petitioners’ interpretation actually\ngives meaning to the words “even though,” whereas the majority\nconcedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely\nout of the statute. See supra this page.\n18                   BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon. According to\nthe majority, because blackletter products liability law\ngenerally recognizes three different types of product de\nfects, “[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would\nbe strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only\ntwo”—namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the\n“even though” clause—“and leave the third to implication.”\nAnte, at 8. The majority’s argument, however, ignores\nthat the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state\nlaw is preserved. As explained above, §22(a) expressly\nprovides that the “[g]eneral rule” is that “State law shall\napply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine\nrelated injury or death.” 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). Be\ncause §22(a) already preserves state-law design defect\nclaims (to the extent the exemption in §22(b)(1) does not\napply), there was no need for Congress separately and\nexpressly to preserve design defect claims in §22(b)(1).\nIndeed, Congress’ principal aim in enacting §22(b)(1) was\nnot to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those,\ntoo, were already preserved by §22(a)), but rather, to\nfederalize comment k-type protection for “unavoidably\nunsafe” vaccines. The “even though” clause simply func\ntions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of\nexpress language in §22(b)(1) specifically preserving de\nsign defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as\nimpliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional\nstate tort claims, which had already been preserved by\n§22(a).15\n——————\n  15 This Court, moreover, has long operated on “the assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the\nFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.” Altria Group, Inc. v.

Putting aside the fact that §22(a) already preserves\ndesign defect claims (to the extent §22(b)(1) does not ap\nply), the majority’s proposed solution would not have fully\neffectuated Congress’ intent. As the legislative history\nmakes clear, Congress used the term “unavoidable” to\neffectuate its intent that the “principle in Comment K\nregarding ‘unavoidably unsafe’ products . . . apply to the\nvaccines covered in the bill.” 1986 Report 26; see also\n1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act’s enact\nment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected\ncomment k,16 while many others had not addressed the\napplicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap\nplied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory\nother than strict liability (e.g., negligence17). A statute\n——————\nan express saving clause in the same statutory section, see 42 U. S.

Ante, at 13. The flaw in that rea\nsoning, of course, is that the FDA’s silence on design de\nfects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.\nIndeed, the majority itself concedes that the “FDA has\nnever even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to\ndecide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its in\ntended use.”18 Ibid. And yet it is undisputed that prior to\nthe Act, vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to\nliability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.\nThat the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehen\nsive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is\nthus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly\ndecided to change course sub silentio and pre-empt a\n——————\nnegligence”); Toner, 112 Idaho, at 340, 732 P. 2d, at 309–310 (“The\nauthorities universally agree that where a product is deemed unavoid\nably unsafe, the plaintiff is deprived of the advantage of a strict liabil\nity cause of action, but may proceed under a negligence cause of ac\ntion”).\n   18 See 42 U.

The Commit\ntee’s intent at the time of considering the Act . . . was . . .\nto leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as\nexpressly altered by the Act”).\n  The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily\nintended to pre-empt design defect claims since the aim of\nsuch tort suits is to promote the development of improved\ndesigns and provide compensation for injured individuals,\nand the Vaccine Act “provides other means for achieving\nboth effects”—most notably through the no-fault compen\nsation program and the National Vaccine Program.

But\nthe majority’s position elides a significant difference be\ntween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.\nAlthough the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services with the obligation to “promote the\ndevelopment of childhood vaccines” and “make or assure\nimprovements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,”\n§300aa–27(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of\nfederal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers\nto improve the design of their vaccines to account for\nscientific and technological advances.

As the legislative history indicates, the\nAct addressed “two overriding concerns”: “(a) the inade\nquacy—from both the perspective of vaccine-injured per\nsons as well as vaccine manufacturers—of the current\napproach to compensating those who have been damaged\nby a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of\nthe childhood vaccine market.” 1986 Report 7. When\nviewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole,\n§22(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme\nthat balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured\nchildren with added liability protections for vaccine manu\nfacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.\n  The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of\nthe no-fault compensation program—a scheme funded\nentirely through an excise tax on vaccines.22 Through that\n——————\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to displace a longstanding species\nof state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an\nexpress saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of\nstate-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law\nwould leave an important regulatory function—i.e., ensuring optimal\nvaccine design—entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.\n  22 The majority’s suggestion that “vaccine manufacturers fund from\n\ntheir sales” the compensation program is misleading.

The structure and legislative history,\nmoreover, point clearly to Congress’ intention to divert\nwould-be tort claimants into the compensation program,\nrather than eliminate a longstanding category of tradi\ntional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (“The Committee\nanticipates that the speed of the compensation program,\nthe low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault na\nture of the required findings, and the relative certainty\nand generosity of the system’s awards will divert a signifi\ncant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation”). In\ndeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would\nhave eliminated the principal source of the “unpredictabil\nity” in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose not\nto pre-empt state tort claims categorically. See 42 U. S. C.\n§300aa–22(a) (providing as a “[g]eneral rule” that “State\nlaw shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a\nvaccine-related injury or death”). That decision reflects\nCongress’ recognition that court actions are essential\n——————\nvaccines/programs/vfc/cdc-vac-price-list.htm. Accordingly, the only way\nthe vaccine manufacturers can be said to actually “fund” the compensa\ntion program is if the cost of the excise tax has an impact on the num\nber of vaccines sold by the vaccine manufacturer. The majority points\nto no evidence that the excise tax—which ordinarily amounts to 75\ncents per dose, 26 U. S. C. §4131(b)—has any impact whatsoever on the\ndemand for vaccines.\n   23 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (“Department of\n\nJustice records indicate that 99.8% of successful Compensation Pro\ngram claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort reme\ndies against vaccine manufacturers”); S.

See §§300aa–\n12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3). Congress thus clearly believed there\nwas still an important function to be played by state tort\nlaw.\n   Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,\nCongress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac\nturers’ liability exposure, including a limited regulatory\ncompliance presumption of adequate warnings, see\n§300aa–22(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure\nto provide direct warnings to patients, §300aa–22(c), a\nheightened standard for punitive damages, §300aa–\n23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for “un\navoidable” side effects, §300aa–22(b)(1). Considered in\nlight of the Vaccine Act as a whole, §22(b)(1)’s exemption\nfrom liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one\npart of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress’\ncareful balance between providing adequate compensation\nfor vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial\nbenefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and\npredictable childhood vaccine supply.\n   The majority’s decision today disturbs that careful\nbalance based on a bare policy preference that it is better\n“to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine\ndesign to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program\nrather than juries.” Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable\nminds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries\nweigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac\ncine design.

Accord\ning to respondent, a ruling that §22(b)(1) does not pre-empt design\ndefect claims could unleash a “crushing wave” of tort litigation that\nwould bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply.\nId., at 28. This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in\nrespondent’s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring\nopinions in this case. In the absence of any empirical data, however,\nthe prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claim\nants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative. As\nan initial matter, the special masters in the autism cases have thus far\nuniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism.\nSee Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as Amici Curiae\n20–21, n. 4 (collecting cases). To be sure, those rulings do not necessar\nily mean that no such causal link exists, cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine\nInjury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately\nbe able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the\nadded tool of civil discovery. But these rulings do highlight the sub\nstantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See Schafer v. American\nCyanamid Co., 20 F. 3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (“[A] petitioner to whom the\nVaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort\nlaw’s yet more serious obstacles to recovery”). Trial courts, moreover,\nhave considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of\nmeritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (in\ncluding for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led\nto shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of\nrespondent and the various amici cited by the concurrence, ante, at 6–7,\nthe possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufac\nturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More\nfundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the\nissue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question,\nthe text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that\nCongress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who\nhave suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The\nmajority’s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress’ role\nand deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Con\ngress intended them to have.\n28               BRUESEWITZ v.
