MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA,\n                  INC., ET AL.\n\n    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,\n\n       FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT, DIVISION THREE\n\n\n No. 08\u20131314. Argued November 3, 2010\u2014Decided February 23, 2011\nThe 1989 version of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208\n  (FMVSS 208) requires, as relevant here, auto manufacturers to in\n  stall seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles. They must in\n  stall lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle\u2019s doors or\n  frames, but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear\n  inner seats, e.g., those next to a minivan\u2019s aisle.\n     The Williamson family and Thanh Williamson\u2019s estate brought this\n  California tort suit, claiming that Thanh died in an accident because\n  the rear aisle seat of the Mazda minivan in which she was riding had\n  a lap belt instead of lap-and-shoulder belts. The state trial court\n  dismissed their claim on the pleadings. The State Court of Appeal af\n  firmed, relying on Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,\n  in which this Court found that an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS\n  208\u2014which required installation of passive restraint devices\u2014pre\n  empted a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to\n  install airbags.\nHeld: FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state tort suits claiming that\n manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, instead\n of lap belts, on rear inner seats. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Because this case involves (1) the same statute as Geier, (2) a\n later version of the same regulation, and (3) a somewhat similar\n claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation, the\n answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in Geier apply di\n rectly here. Thus, the statute\u2019s express pre-emption clause cannot\n pre-empt the common-law tort action here; but neither can its saving\n clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption\n principles. The Court consequently turns to Geier\u2019s third subsidiary\n2        WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the fed\n    eral regulation. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that\n    \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\u201d of a federal law is pre\n    empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67. In Geier, the state\n    law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant fed\n    eral regulatory objective, namely, giving manufacturers a choice\n    among different kinds of passive restraint systems. This conclusion\n    was supported by the regulation\u2019s history, the agency\u2019s contempora\n    neous explanation, and the Government\u2019s current understanding of\n    the regulation. The history showed that the Department of Trans\n    portation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufactur\n    ers with a choice of systems. DOT\u2019s contemporaneous explanation of\n    the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor\n    tant means for achieving DOT\u2019s basic objectives. It phased in passive\n    restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag\n    technology and develop better systems; it worried that requiring air\n    bags would cause a public backlash; and it was concerned about air\n    bag safety and cost. Finally, the Government\u2019s current understand\n    ing was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would \u201c \u2018 \u201cstan[d] as\n    an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objec\n    tives.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 529 U. S., at 883. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Like the regulation in Geier, the instant regulation leaves the\n    manufacturer with a choice, and the tort suit here would restrict that\n    choice. But in contrast to Geier, the choice here is not a significant\n    regulatory objective. The regulation\u2019s history resembles the history\n    of airbags to some degree. DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap\n    and-shoulder belts in rear seats in 1984. But by 1989, changed cir\n    cumstances led DOT to require manufacturers to install lap-and\n    shoulder belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer\n    choice for rear inner seats. Its reasons for doing so differed consid\n    erably from its 1984 reasons for permitting a choice of passive re\n    straint. It was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it thought\n    that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety and did not pose\n    additional safety risks; and it was not seeking to use the regulation to\n    spur development of alternative safety devices. Instead, DOT\n    thought that the requirement would not be cost effective. That fact\n    alone cannot show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits.\n    For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.\n    For another, many federal safety regulations embody a cost\n    effectiveness judgment. To infer pre-emptive intent from the mere\n    existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment would eliminate the\n    possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum stan\n    dard. Finally, the Solicitor General represents that DOT\u2019s regulation\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  does not pre-empt this tort suit. As in Geier, \u201cthe agency\u2019s own views\n  should make a difference,\u201d 529 U. S., at 883, and DOT has not ex\n  pressed inconsistent views on this subject. Pp. 8\u201312.\n167 Cal.

They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats\nnext to a vehicle\u2019s doors or frames. But they have a choice\nabout what to install on rear inner seats (say, middle seats\nor those next to a minivan\u2019s aisle). There they can install\neither (1) simple lap belts or (2) lap-and-shoulder belts. 54\nFed. Reg. 46257\u201346258 (1989); 49 CFR \u00a7571.208 (1993),\npromulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor\nVehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71381 et seq. (1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive\nchange at 49 U. S. C. \u00a730101 et seq. (2006 ed.)).\n  The question presented here is whether this federal\nregulation pre-empts a state tort suit that, if successful,\nwould deny manufacturers a choice of belts for rear inner\nseats by imposing tort liability upon those who choose to\ninstall a simple lap belt. We conclude that providing\nmanufacturers with this seatbelt choice is not a significant\nobjective of the federal regulation. Consequently, the\n2     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation does not pre-empt the state tort suit.\n                                I\n   In 2002, the Williamson family, riding in their 1993\nMazda minivan, was struck head on by another vehicle.\nThanh Williamson was sitting in a rear aisle seat, wearing\na lap belt; she died in the accident. Delbert and Alexa\nWilliamson were wearing lap-and-shoulder belts; they\nsurvived. They, along with Thanh\u2019s estate, subsequently\nbrought this California tort suit against Mazda. They\nclaimed that Mazda should have installed lap-and\nshoulder belts on rear aisle seats, and that Thanh died\nbecause Mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead.\n   The California trial court dismissed this tort claim on\nthe basis of the pleadings. And the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed. The appeals court noted that in Geier v.\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), this\nCourt considered whether a different portion of (an older\nversion of) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208\n(FMVSS 208)\u2014a portion that required installation of\npassive restraint devices\u2014pre-empted a state tort suit\nthat sought to hold an auto manufacturer liable for failure\nto install a particular kind of passive restraint, namely,\nairbags. We found that the federal regulation intended to\nassure manufacturers that they would retain a choice of\ninstalling any of several different passive restraint de\nvices. And the regulation sought to assure them that they\nwould not have to exercise this choice in favor of airbags.\nFor that reason we thought that the federal regulation\npre-empted a state tort suit that, by premising tort liabil\nity on a failure to install airbags, would have deprived the\nmanufacturers of the choice that the federal regulation\nhad assured them. Id., at 874\u2013875.\n   The court saw considerable similarity between this case\nand Geier. The federal regulation at issue here gives\nmanufacturers a choice among two different kinds of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseatbelts for rear inner seats. And a state lawsuit that\npremises tort liability on a failure to install a particular\nkind of seatbelt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, would in\neffect deprive the manufacturer of that choice. The court\nconcluded that, as in Geier, the federal regulation pre\nempts the state tort suit. 167 Cal. App. 4th 905, 84 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 545 (2008).\n  The Williamsons sought certiorari. And we granted\ncertiorari in light of the fact that several courts have\ninterpreted Geier as indicating that FMVSS 208 pre-empts\nstate tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have\ninstalled lap-and-shoulder belts, not lap belts, on rear\ninner seats. Carden v. General Motors Corp., 509 F. 3d\n227 (CA5 2007); Roland v. General Motors Corp., 881 N. E.\n2d 722 (Ind. App. 2008); Heinricher v. Volvo Car Corp., 61\nMass. App. 313, 809 N. E. 2d 1094 (2004).\n                             II\n  In Geier, we considered a portion of an earlier (1984)\nversion of FMVSS 208. That regulation required manu\nfacturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint\nsystems, thereby providing occupants with automatic\naccident protection. 49 Fed. Reg. 28983 (1984). But that\nregulation also gave manufacturers a choice among sev\neral different passive restraint systems, including airbags\nand automatic seatbelts. Id., at 28996. The question\nbefore the Court was whether the Act, together with the\nregulation, pre-empted a state tort suit that would have\nheld a manufacturer liable for not installing airbags. 529\nU. S., at 865. By requiring manufacturers to install air\nbags (in order to avoid tort liability) the tort suit would\nhave deprived the manufacturers of the choice among\npassive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave\nthem. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical\nLaboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 713 (1985) (\u201c[S]tate laws\ncan be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by\n4     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal statutes\u201d).\n   We divided this basic pre-emption question into three\nsubsidiary questions. 529 U. S., at 867. First, we asked\nwhether the statute\u2019s express pre-emption provision pre\nempted the state tort suit. That statutory clause says that\n\u201cno State\u201d may \u201cestablish, or . . . continue in effect . . . any\nsafety standard applicable to the same aspect of perform\nance\u201d of a motor vehicle or item of equipment \u201cwhich is not\nidentical to the Federal standard.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71392(d)\n(1988 ed.) (emphasis added). We had previously held that\na word somewhat similar to \u201cstandard,\u201d namely, \u201crequire\nments\u201d (found in a similar statute) included within its\nscope state \u201ccommon-law duties,\u201d such as duties created by\nstate tort law. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 502\u2013\n503 (1996) (plurality opinion); id., at 503\u2013505 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at\n509\u2013512 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). But we nonetheless held that the state tort suit\nin question fell outside the scope of this particular pre\nemption clause. That is primarily because the statute also\ncontains a saving clause, which says that \u201c[c]ompliance\nwith\u201d a federal safety standard \u201cdoes not exempt any\nperson from any liability under common law.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71397(k) (emphasis added). Since tort law is ordinarily\n\u201ccommon law,\u201d we held that \u201cthe presence of the saving\nclause,\u201d makes clear that Congress intended state tort\nsuits to fall outside the scope of the express pre-emption\nclause. Geier, 529 U. S., at 868.\n   Second, we asked the converse question: The saving\nclause at least removes tort actions from the scope of the\nexpress pre-emption clause. Id., at 869. But does it do\nmore? Does it foreclose or limit \u201cthe operation of ordinary\npre-emption principles insofar as those principles instruct\nus to read\u201d federal statutes as pre-empting state laws\n(including state common-law standards) that \u201cactually\nconflict\u201d with the federal statutes (or related regulations)?\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded\nthat the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the op\neration of \u201cordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in\nlongstanding precedent.\u201d Id., at 874.\n  These two holdings apply directly to the case before us.\nWe here consider (1) the same statute, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71381 et\nseq.; (2) a later version of the same regulation, FMVSS\n208; and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort\naction conflicts with the federal regulation. In light of\nGeier, the statute\u2019s express pre-emption clause cannot pre\nempt the common-law tort action; but neither can the\nstatute\u2019s saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of\nordinary conflict pre-emption principles. We consequently\nturn our attention to Geier\u2019s third subsidiary question,\nwhether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the\nfederal regulation.\n                             III\n    Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state\nlaw that \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\nexecution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of a federal\nlaw is pre-empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67\n(1941). See ibid. (federal statute can pre-empt a state\nstatute); Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504\n(1992) (federal statute can pre-empt a state tort suit);\nFidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S.\n141 (1982) (federal regulation can pre-empt a state stat\nute); Geier, supra (federal regulation can pre-empt a state\ntort suit). In Geier we found that the state law stood as an\n\u201c \u2018obstacle\u2019 to the accomplishment\u201d of a significant federal\nregulatory objective, namely, the maintenance of manufac\nturer choice. 529 U. S., at 886. We must decide whether\nthe same is true here.\n                             A\n  At the heart of Geier lies our determination that giving\n6     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nauto manufacturers a choice among different kinds\nof passive restraint devices was a significant objective of\nthe federal regulation. We reached this conclusion on\nthe basis of our examination of the regulation, including\nits history, the promulgating agency\u2019s contemporaneous\nexplanation of its objectives, and the agency\u2019s current\nviews of the regulation\u2019s pre-emptive effect.\n   The history showed that the Department of Transporta\ntion (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manu\nfacturers with a choice. In 1967 DOT required manufac\nturers to install manual seat belts. Geier, supra, at 875;\n32 Fed. Reg. 2408, 2415 (1967). Because many car occu\npants did not \u201cbuckle up,\u201d DOT began to require passive\nprotection, such as airbags or automatic seatbelts, but\nwithout \u201cfavor[ing] or \u201cexpect[ing]\u201d the use of airbags.\nGeier, supra, at 875 (internal quotation marks omitted); 35\nFed. Reg. 16927 (1970). DOT subsequently approved the\nuse of ignition interlocks, which froze the ignition until the\noccupant buckled the belt, as a substitute for passive\nrestraints. Geier, supra, at 876; 37 Fed. Reg. 3911 (1972).\nBut the interlock devices were unpopular with the public,\nand Congress soon forbade the agency to make them a\nmeans of compliance. Geier, supra, at 876; Motor Vehicle\nand Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, \u00a7109, 88 Stat.\n1482 (previously codified at 15 U. S. C. \u00a71410(b) (1988\ned.)). DOT then temporarily switched to the use of dem\nonstration projects, but later it returned to mandating\npassive restraints, again leaving manufacturers with a\nchoice of systems. Geier, supra, at 876\u2013877; see 49 Fed.\nReg. 28962 (1984).\n   DOT\u2019s contemporaneous explanation of its 1984 regula\ntion made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor\ntant means for achieving its basic objectives. The 1984\nregulation gradually phased in passive restraint require\nments, initially requiring manufacturers to equip only\n10% of their new fleets with passive restraints. DOT\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that it intended its phasing period partly to give\nmanufacturers time to improve airbag technology and to\ndevelop \u201cother, better\u201d passive restraint systems. Geier,\n529 U. S., at 879. DOT further explained that it had\nrejected an \u201c \u2018all airbag\u2019 \u201d system. Ibid. It was worried\nthat requiring airbags in most or all vehicles would cause\na public backlash, like the backlash against interlock\ndevices. Ibid. DOT also had concerns about the safety of\nairbags, for they could injure out-of-place occupants, par\nticularly children. Id., at 877\u2013878. And, given the cost of\nairbags, vehicle owners might not replace them when\nnecessary, leaving occupants without passive protection.\nIbid. The regulation therefore \u201cdeliberately sought vari\nety\u2014a mix of several different passive restraint systems.\u201d\nId., at 878. DOT hoped that this mix would lead to better\ninformation about the devices\u2019 comparative effectiveness\nand to the eventual development of \u201calternative, cheaper,\nand safer passive restraint systems.\u201d Id., at 879.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General told us that a tort suit that\ninsisted upon use of airbags, as opposed to other federally\npermissible passive restraint systems, would \u201cstan[d] as\nan obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these\nobjectives.\u201d Id., at 883 (quoting Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,\nO. T. 1999, No. 98\u20131811, pp. 25\u201326 (hereinafter United\nStates Brief in Geier) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd we gave weight to the Solicitor General\u2019s view in light\nof the fact that it \u201c \u2018embodie[d] the Secretary\u2019s policy judg\nment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers\ninstalled alternative protection systems in their fleets\nrather than one particular system in every car.\u2019 \u201d 529\nU. S., at 881 (quoting United States Brief in Geier 25\u201326).\n   Taken together, this history, the agency\u2019s contempora\nneous explanation, and the Government\u2019s current under\nstanding of the regulation convinced us that manufacturer\nchoice was an important regulatory objective. And since\n8     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\nthat objective, we found the tort suit pre-empted.\n                              B\n   We turn now to the present case. Like the regulation in\nGeier, the regulation here leaves the manufacturer with a\nchoice. And, like the tort suit in Geier, the tort suit here\nwould restrict that choice. But unlike Geier, we do not\nbelieve here that choice is a significant regulatory objec\ntive.\n   We concede that the history of the regulation before us\nresembles the history of airbags to some degree. In 1984,\nDOT rejected a regulation that would have required the\nuse of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats. 49 Fed. Reg.\n15241. Nonetheless, by 1989 when DOT promulgated the\npresent regulation, it had \u201cconcluded that several factors\nhad changed.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.\n   DOT then required manufacturers to install a particular\nkind of belt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, for rear outer\nseats. In respect to rear inner seats, it retained manufac\nturer choice as to which kind of belt to install. But its\n1989 reasons for retaining that choice differed considera\nbly from its 1984 reasons for permitting manufacturers a\nchoice in respect to airbags. DOT here was not concerned\nabout consumer acceptance; it was convinced that lap-and\nshoulder belts would increase safety; it did not fear addi\ntional safety risks arising from use of those belts; it had\nno interest in assuring a mix of devices; and, though it\nwas concerned about additional costs, that concern was\ndiminishing.\n   In respect to consumer acceptance, DOT wrote that if\n    \u201cpeople who are familiar with and in the habit of\n    wearing lap/shoulder belts in the front seat find\n    lap/shoulder belts in the rear seat, it stands to reason\n    that they would be more likely to wear those belts\n    when riding in the rear seat.\u201d 53 Fed. Reg. 47983\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    (1988).\n   In respect to safety, DOT wrote that, because an in\ncreasing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts,\nrear seat lap-and-shoulder belts would have \u201cprogressively\ngreater actual safety benefits.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.\nIt added:\n    \u201c[s]tudies of occupant protection from 1968 forward\n    show that the lap-only safety belts installed in rear\n    seating positions are effective in reducing the risk of\n    death and injury. . . . However, the agency believes\n    that rear-seat lap/shoulder safety belts would be even\n    more effective.\u201d Ibid.\n  Five years earlier, DOT had expressed concern that lap\nand-shoulder belts might negatively impact child safety by\ninterfering with the use of certain child car seats that\nrelied upon a tether. But by 1989, DOT found that car\nseat designs \u201chad shifted away\u201d from tethers. 53 Fed. Reg.\n47983. And rear lap-and-shoulder belts could therefore\noffer safety benefits for children old enough to use them\nwithout diminishing the safety of smaller children in car\nseats. Id., at 47988\u201347989 (\u201c[T]he agency believes that\nthis proposal for rear seat lap/shoulder belts would offer\nbenefits for children riding in some types of booster seats,\nwould have no positive or negative effects on children\nriding in most designs of car seats and children that are\ntoo small to use shoulder belts, and would offer older\nchildren the same incremental safety protection [as\nadults]\u201d). Nor did DOT seek to use its regulation to spur\nthe development of alternative kinds of rear aisle or mid\ndle seat safety devices. See 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.\n  Why then did DOT not require lap-and-shoulder belts in\nthese seats? We have found some indication that it\nthought use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear aisle seats\ncould cause \u201centry and exit problems for occupants of\nseating positions to the rear\u201d by \u201cstretch[ing] the shoulder\n10     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelt across the aisleway,\u201d id., at 46258. However, DOT\nencouraged manufacturers to address this issue through\ninnovation:\n     \u201c[I]n those cases where manufacturers are able to de\n     sign and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions\n     adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the\n     aisleway\u2019s purpose of allowing access to more rear\n     ward seating positions[, the agency] encourages the\n     manufacturers to do so.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.\nAnd there is little indication that DOT considered this\nmatter a significant safety concern. Cf. Letter from Philip\nR. Recht, Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdmin., to Roger Matoba (Dec. 28, 1994), App. to Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 2 (\u201cWith respect to your concerns\nabout the safety of shoulder safety belts which cross an\naisle, I note that such belts do not in fact prevent rear\nward passengers from exiting the vehicle. Such passen\ngers may . . . g[o] under or over the belt. They may also\nmove the belt aside\u201d).\n  The more important reason why DOT did not require\nlap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats was that it\nthought that this requirement would not be cost-effective.\nThe agency explained that it would be significantly more\nexpensive for manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder\nbelts in rear middle and aisle seats than in seats next to\nthe car doors. Ibid. But that fact\u2014the fact that DOT\nmade a negative judgment about cost effectiveness\u2014\ncannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common\nlaw tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a\ndifferent conclusion.\n  For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would\nremain frozen. Rather it pointed out that costs were\nfalling as manufacturers were \u201cvoluntarily equipping more\nand more of their vehicles with rear seat lap/shoulder\nbelts.\u201d Ibid. For another thing, many, perhaps most,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal safety regulations embody some kind of cost\neffectiveness judgment. While an agency could base a\ndecision to pre-empt on its cost-effectiveness judgment, we\nare satisfied that the rulemaking record at issue here\ndiscloses no such pre-emptive intent. And to infer from\nthe mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment\nthat the federal agency intends to bar States from impos\ning stricter standards would treat all such federal stan\ndards as if they were maximum standards, eliminating the\npossibility that the federal agency seeks only to set forth a\nminimum standard potentially supplemented through\nstate tort law. We cannot reconcile this consequence with\na statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a\ncontinued meaningful role for state tort law. Supra, at 4.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General tells us that DOT\u2019s regula\ntion does not pre-empt this tort suit. As in Geier, \u201cthe\nagency\u2019s own views should make a difference.\u201d 529 U. S.,\nat 883.\n    \u201cCongress has delegated to DOT authority to imple\n    ment the statute; the subject matter is technical; and\n    the relevant history and background are complex and\n    extensive. The agency is likely to have a thorough\n    understanding of its own regulation and its objectives\n    and is \u2018uniquely qualified\u2019 to comprehend the likely\n    impact of state requirements.\u201d Ibid.\nThere is \u201cno reason to suspect that the Solicitor General\u2019s\nrepresentation of DOT\u2019s views reflects anything other than\n\u2018the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the mat\nter.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 884 (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452,\n462 (1997)).\n   Neither has DOT expressed inconsistent views on this\nsubject. In Geier, the Solicitor General pointed out that\n\u201cstate tort law does not conflict with a federal \u2018minimum\nstandard\u2019 merely because state law imposes a more strin\ngent requirement.\u201d United States Brief in Geier 21 (cita\n12    WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion omitted). And the Solicitor General explained that a\nstandard giving manufacturers \u201cmultiple options for the\ndesign of\u201d a device would not pre-empt a suit claiming that\na manufacturer should have chosen one particular option,\nwhere \u201cthe Secretary did not determine that the availabil\nity of options was necessary to promote safety.\u201d Id., at 22;\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Wood v.\nGeneral Motors Corp., O. T. 1989, No. 89\u201346, p. 15. This\nlast statement describes the present case.\n\n   In Geier, then, the regulation\u2019s history, the agency\u2019s\ncontemporaneous explanation, and its consistently held\ninterpretive views indicated that the regulation sought to\nmaintain manufacturer choice in order to further signifi\ncant regulatory objectives. Here, these same considera\ntions indicate the contrary. We consequently conclude\nthat, even though the state tort suit may restrict the\nmanufacturer\u2019s choice, it does not \u201cstan[d] as an obstacle\nto the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and objec\ntives\u201d of federal law. Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Thus, the\nregulation does not pre-empt this tort action.\n\n  The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is re\nversed.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

S. C. \u00a71381 et\nseq. (1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive change at\n49 U. S. C. \u00a730101 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. III)). In\nGeier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000),\nthe Court concluded that the \u201csaving clause (like the\nexpress pre-emption provision) does not bar the ordinary\nworking of conflict pre-emption principles,\u201d id., at 869, and\ntherefore engaged in an implied pre-emption analysis.\nThe majority and dissent in Geier agreed that \u201ca court\nshould not find pre-emption too readily in the absence of\nclear evidence of a conflict.\u201d Id., at 885.\n  I agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of this case and\nwith its reasoning. I write separately only to emphasize\nthe Court\u2019s rejection of an overreading of Geier that has\ndeveloped since that opinion was issued.\n  Geier does not stand, as the California Court of Appeal,\n167 Cal.

As the\nUnited States notes, \u201ca conflict results only when the\nSafety Act (or regulations implementing the Safety Act)\ndoes not just set out options for compliance, but also pro\nvides that the regulated parties must remain free to\nchoose among those options.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 8. In other words, the mere fact that an\nagency regulation allows manufacturers a choice between\noptions is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption;\ncourts should only find pre-emption where evidence exists\nthat an agency has a regulatory objective\u2014e.g., obtaining\na mix of passive restraint mechanisms, as in Geier\u2014whose\nachievement depends on manufacturers having a choice\nbetween options. A link between a regulatory objective\nand the need for manufacturer choice to achieve that\nobjective is the lynchpin of implied pre-emption when\nthere is a saving clause.\n  Absent strong indications from the agency that it needs\nmanufacturers to have options in order to achieve a \u201csig\nnificant . . . regulatory objective,\u201d ante, at 5, state tort\nsuits are not \u201cobstacle[s] to the accomplishment . . . of the\nfull purposes and objectives\u201d of federal law, Hines v.\nDavidowitz, 312 U.

I agree. But\nI reach this result by a more direct route: the Safety Act\u2019s\nsaving clause, which speaks directly to this question and\nanswers it. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a730103(e).\n                                I\n   The plain text of the Safety Act resolves this case.\nCongress has instructed that \u201c[c]ompliance with a motor\nvehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does\nnot exempt a person from liability at common law.\u201d Ibid.\nThis saving clause \u201cexplicitly preserv[es] state common\nlaw actions.\u201d Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18).\nHere, Mazda complied with FMVSS 208 when it chose to\ninstall a simple lap belt. According to Mazda, the Wil\nliamsons\u2019 lawsuit alleging that it should have installed a\nlap-and-shoulder seatbelt instead is pre-empted. That\nargument is foreclosed by the saving clause; the William\nsons\u2019 state tort action is not pre-empted.\n   The majority does not rely on the Safety Act\u2019s saving\nclause because this Court effectively read it out of the\n2      WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstatute in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.\n861 (2000). In Geier, the Court interpreted the saving\nclause as simply cancelling out the statute\u2019s express pre\nemption clause with respect to common-law tort actions.\nThis left the Court free to consider the effect of conflict\npre-emption principles on such tort actions. See id., at\n869.\n  But it makes no sense to read the express pre-emption\nclause in conjunction with the saving clause. See id., at\n898 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The express pre-emption\nclause bars States from having any safety \u201cstandard appli\ncable to the same aspect of performance\u201d as a federal\nstandard unless it is \u201cidentical\u201d to the federal one.\n\u00a730103(b). That clause pre-empts States from establish\ning \u201cobjective rule[s] prescribed by a legislature or an\nadministrative agency\u201d in competition with the federal\nstandards; it says nothing about the tort lawsuits that are\nthe focus of the saving clause. Id., at 896.* Read inde\npendently of the express pre-emption clause, the saving\nclause simply means what it says: FMVSS 208 does not\npre-empt state common-law actions.\n                             II\n  As in Geier, rather than following the plain text of the\nstatute, the majority\u2019s analysis turns on whether the tort\nlawsuit here \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplish\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d\nof FMVSS 208.

MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmore plainly, the question is whether the regulators really\nwanted manufacturers to have a choice or did not really\nwant them to have a choice but gave them one anyway.\n   To answer that question, the majority engages in a\n\u201cfreewheeling, extratextual, and broad evaluatio[n] of the\n\u2018purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d of FMVSS 208. Wyeth, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 23) (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The Court\nwades into a sea of agency musings and Government\nlitigating positions and fishes for what the agency may\nhave been thinking 20 years ago when it drafted the rele\nvant provision. After scrutinizing the 1989 Federal Regis\nter, a letter written in 1994, and the Solicitor General\u2019s\npresent-day assurances, the Court finds that Department\nof Transportation liked the idea of lap-and-shoulder seat\nbelts in all seats, but did not require them, primarily for\ncost-efficiency reasons and also because of some concern\nfor ingress-egress around the belt mounts. Ante, at 8\u201311.\nFrom all of this, the majority determines that although\nthe regulators specifically and intentionally gave manu\nfacturers a choice between types of seatbelts, that choice\nwas not a \u201csignificant regulatory objective\u201d and so does not\npre-empt state tort lawsuits.\n   That the Court in Geier reached an opposite conclusion\nreveals the utterly unconstrained nature of purposes-and\nobjectives pre-emption. There is certainly \u201cconsiderable\nsimilarity between this case and Geier.\u201d Ante, at 2.

United States v. Public Util.\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 345 U. S. 295, 319 (1953) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring) (describing reliance on legislative history).\nThe majority cites no difference on the face of FMVSS 208\nbetween the airbag choice addressed in Geier and the\nseatbelt choice at issue in this case.\n  According to the majority, to determine whether FMVSS\n208 pre-empts a tort suit, courts apparently must embark\non the same expedition undertaken here: sifting through\nthe Federal Register, examining agency ruminations, and\nasking the Government what it currently thinks. Pre\nemption is then proper if the court decides that the regula\ntors thought the choice especially important, but not if the\nchoice was only somewhat important.

Argued November 3, 2010\u2014Decided February 23, 2011\nThe 1989 version of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208\n  (FMVSS 208) requires, as relevant here, auto manufacturers to in\n  stall seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles. They must in\n  stall lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle\u2019s doors or\n  frames, but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear\n  inner seats, e.g., those next to a minivan\u2019s aisle.\n     The Williamson family and Thanh Williamson\u2019s estate brought this\n  California tort suit, claiming that Thanh died in an accident because\n  the rear aisle seat of the Mazda minivan in which she was riding had\n  a lap belt instead of lap-and-shoulder belts. The state trial court\n  dismissed their claim on the pleadings. The State Court of Appeal af\n  firmed, relying on Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,\n  in which this Court found that an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS\n  208\u2014which required installation of passive restraint devices\u2014pre\n  empted a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to\n  install airbags.\nHeld: FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state tort suits claiming that\n manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, instead\n of lap belts, on rear inner seats. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Because this case involves (1) the same statute as Geier, (2) a\n later version of the same regulation, and (3) a somewhat similar\n claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation, the\n answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in Geier apply di\n rectly here. Thus, the statute\u2019s express pre-emption clause cannot\n pre-empt the common-law tort action here; but neither can its saving\n clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption\n principles. The Court consequently turns to Geier\u2019s third subsidiary\n2        WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the fed\n    eral regulation. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that\n    \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\u201d of a federal law is pre\n    empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67. In Geier, the state\n    law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant fed\n    eral regulatory objective, namely, giving manufacturers a choice\n    among different kinds of passive restraint systems. This conclusion\n    was supported by the regulation\u2019s history, the agency\u2019s contempora\n    neous explanation, and the Government\u2019s current understanding of\n    the regulation. The history showed that the Department of Trans\n    portation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufactur\n    ers with a choice of systems. DOT\u2019s contemporaneous explanation of\n    the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor\n    tant means for achieving DOT\u2019s basic objectives. It phased in passive\n    restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag\n    technology and develop better systems; it worried that requiring air\n    bags would cause a public backlash; and it was concerned about air\n    bag safety and cost. Finally, the Government\u2019s current understand\n    ing was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would \u201c \u2018 \u201cstan[d] as\n    an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objec\n    tives.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 529 U. S., at 883. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Like the regulation in Geier, the instant regulation leaves the\n    manufacturer with a choice, and the tort suit here would restrict that\n    choice. But in contrast to Geier, the choice here is not a significant\n    regulatory objective. The regulation\u2019s history resembles the history\n    of airbags to some degree. DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap\n    and-shoulder belts in rear seats in 1984. But by 1989, changed cir\n    cumstances led DOT to require manufacturers to install lap-and\n    shoulder belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer\n    choice for rear inner seats. Its reasons for doing so differed consid\n    erably from its 1984 reasons for permitting a choice of passive re\n    straint. It was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it thought\n    that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety and did not pose\n    additional safety risks; and it was not seeking to use the regulation to\n    spur development of alternative safety devices. Instead, DOT\n    thought that the requirement would not be cost effective. That fact\n    alone cannot show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits.\n    For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.\n    For another, many federal safety regulations embody a cost\n    effectiveness judgment. To infer pre-emptive intent from the mere\n    existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment would eliminate the\n    possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum stan\n    dard. Finally, the Solicitor General represents that DOT\u2019s regulation\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

As in Geier, \u201cthe agency\u2019s own views\n  should make a difference,\u201d 529 U. S., at 883, and DOT has not ex\n  pressed inconsistent views on this subject.

They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats\nnext to a vehicle\u2019s doors or frames. But they have a choice\nabout what to install on rear inner seats (say, middle seats\nor those next to a minivan\u2019s aisle). There they can install\neither (1) simple lap belts or (2) lap-and-shoulder belts. 54\nFed. Reg. 46257\u201346258 (1989); 49 CFR \u00a7571.208 (1993),\npromulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor\nVehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71381 et seq. (1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive\nchange at 49 U. S. C. \u00a730101 et seq. (2006 ed.)).\n  The question presented here is whether this federal\nregulation pre-empts a state tort suit that, if successful,\nwould deny manufacturers a choice of belts for rear inner\nseats by imposing tort liability upon those who choose to\ninstall a simple lap belt. We conclude that providing\nmanufacturers with this seatbelt choice is not a significant\nobjective of the federal regulation. Consequently, the\n2     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation does not pre-empt the state tort suit.\n                                I\n   In 2002, the Williamson family, riding in their 1993\nMazda minivan, was struck head on by another vehicle.\nThanh Williamson was sitting in a rear aisle seat, wearing\na lap belt; she died in the accident. Delbert and Alexa\nWilliamson were wearing lap-and-shoulder belts; they\nsurvived. They, along with Thanh\u2019s estate, subsequently\nbrought this California tort suit against Mazda. They\nclaimed that Mazda should have installed lap-and\nshoulder belts on rear aisle seats, and that Thanh died\nbecause Mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead.\n   The California trial court dismissed this tort claim on\nthe basis of the pleadings. And the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed. The appeals court noted that in Geier v.\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), this\nCourt considered whether a different portion of (an older\nversion of) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208\n(FMVSS 208)\u2014a portion that required installation of\npassive restraint devices\u2014pre-empted a state tort suit\nthat sought to hold an auto manufacturer liable for failure\nto install a particular kind of passive restraint, namely,\nairbags. We found that the federal regulation intended to\nassure manufacturers that they would retain a choice of\ninstalling any of several different passive restraint de\nvices. And the regulation sought to assure them that they\nwould not have to exercise this choice in favor of airbags.\nFor that reason we thought that the federal regulation\npre-empted a state tort suit that, by premising tort liabil\nity on a failure to install airbags, would have deprived the\nmanufacturers of the choice that the federal regulation\nhad assured them. Id., at 874\u2013875.\n   The court saw considerable similarity between this case\nand Geier. The federal regulation at issue here gives\nmanufacturers a choice among two different kinds of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseatbelts for rear inner seats. And a state lawsuit that\npremises tort liability on a failure to install a particular\nkind of seatbelt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, would in\neffect deprive the manufacturer of that choice. The court\nconcluded that, as in Geier, the federal regulation pre\nempts the state tort suit. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259977\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259977/williamson-v-mazda-motor-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

And we granted\ncertiorari in light of the fact that several courts have\ninterpreted Geier as indicating that FMVSS 208 pre-empts\nstate tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have\ninstalled lap-and-shoulder belts, not lap belts, on rear\ninner seats. Carden v. General Motors Corp., 509 F. 3d\n227 (CA5 2007); Roland v. General Motors Corp., 881 N. E.\n2d 722 (Ind. App. 2008); Heinricher v. Volvo Car Corp., 61\nMass. App. 313, 809 N. E. 2d 1094 (2004).\n                             II\n  In Geier, we considered a portion of an earlier (1984)\nversion of FMVSS 208. That regulation required manu\nfacturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint\nsystems, thereby providing occupants with automatic\naccident protection. 49 Fed. Reg. 28983 (1984). But that\nregulation also gave manufacturers a choice among sev\neral different passive restraint systems, including airbags\nand automatic seatbelts. Id., at 28996. The question\nbefore the Court was whether the Act, together with the\nregulation, pre-empted a state tort suit that would have\nheld a manufacturer liable for not installing airbags. 529\nU. S., at 865. By requiring manufacturers to install air\nbags (in order to avoid tort liability) the tort suit would\nhave deprived the manufacturers of the choice among\npassive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave\nthem. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical\nLaboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 713 (1985) (\u201c[S]tate laws\ncan be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by\n4     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal statutes\u201d).\n   We divided this basic pre-emption question into three\nsubsidiary questions. 529 U. S., at 867. First, we asked\nwhether the statute\u2019s express pre-emption provision pre\nempted the state tort suit. That statutory clause says that\n\u201cno State\u201d may \u201cestablish, or . . . continue in effect . . . any\nsafety standard applicable to the same aspect of perform\nance\u201d of a motor vehicle or item of equipment \u201cwhich is not\nidentical to the Federal standard.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71392(d)\n(1988 ed.) (emphasis added). We had previously held that\na word somewhat similar to \u201cstandard,\u201d namely, \u201crequire\nments\u201d (found in a similar statute) included within its\nscope state \u201ccommon-law duties,\u201d such as duties created by\nstate tort law. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 502\u2013\n503 (1996) (plurality opinion); id., at 503\u2013505 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at\n509\u2013512 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). But we nonetheless held that the state tort suit\nin question fell outside the scope of this particular pre\nemption clause. That is primarily because the statute also\ncontains a saving clause, which says that \u201c[c]ompliance\nwith\u201d a federal safety standard \u201cdoes not exempt any\nperson from any liability under common law.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71397(k) (emphasis added). Since tort law is ordinarily\n\u201ccommon law,\u201d we held that \u201cthe presence of the saving\nclause,\u201d makes clear that Congress intended state tort\nsuits to fall outside the scope of the express pre-emption\nclause. Geier, 529 U. S., at 868.\n   Second, we asked the converse question: The saving\nclause at least removes tort actions from the scope of the\nexpress pre-emption clause. Id., at 869. But does it do\nmore? Does it foreclose or limit \u201cthe operation of ordinary\npre-emption principles insofar as those principles instruct\nus to read\u201d federal statutes as pre-empting state laws\n(including state common-law standards) that \u201cactually\nconflict\u201d with the federal statutes (or related regulations)?\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded\nthat the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the op\neration of \u201cordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in\nlongstanding precedent.\u201d Id., at 874.\n  These two holdings apply directly to the case before us.\nWe here consider (1) the same statute, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71381 et\nseq.; (2) a later version of the same regulation, FMVSS\n208; and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort\naction conflicts with the federal regulation. In light of\nGeier, the statute\u2019s express pre-emption clause cannot pre\nempt the common-law tort action; but neither can the\nstatute\u2019s saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of\nordinary conflict pre-emption principles. We consequently\nturn our attention to Geier\u2019s third subsidiary question,\nwhether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the\nfederal regulation.\n                             III\n    Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state\nlaw that \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\nexecution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of a federal\nlaw is pre-empted. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67\n(1941). See ibid. (federal statute can pre-empt a state\nstatute); Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504\n(1992) (federal statute can pre-empt a state tort suit);\nFidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S.\n141 (1982) (federal regulation can pre-empt a state stat\nute); Geier, supra (federal regulation can pre-empt a state\ntort suit). In Geier we found that the state law stood as an\n\u201c \u2018obstacle\u2019 to the accomplishment\u201d of a significant federal\nregulatory objective, namely, the maintenance of manufac\nturer choice. 529 U. S., at 886. We must decide whether\nthe same is true here.\n                             A\n  At the heart of Geier lies our determination that giving\n6     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nauto manufacturers a choice among different kinds\nof passive restraint devices was a significant objective of\nthe federal regulation. We reached this conclusion on\nthe basis of our examination of the regulation, including\nits history, the promulgating agency\u2019s contemporaneous\nexplanation of its objectives, and the agency\u2019s current\nviews of the regulation\u2019s pre-emptive effect.\n   The history showed that the Department of Transporta\ntion (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manu\nfacturers with a choice. In 1967 DOT required manufac\nturers to install manual seat belts. Geier, supra, at 875;\n32 Fed. Reg. 2408, 2415 (1967). Because many car occu\npants did not \u201cbuckle up,\u201d DOT began to require passive\nprotection, such as airbags or automatic seatbelts, but\nwithout \u201cfavor[ing] or \u201cexpect[ing]\u201d the use of airbags.\nGeier, supra, at 875 (internal quotation marks omitted); 35\nFed. Reg. 16927 (1970). DOT subsequently approved the\nuse of ignition interlocks, which froze the ignition until the\noccupant buckled the belt, as a substitute for passive\nrestraints. Geier, supra, at 876; 37 Fed. Reg. 3911 (1972).\nBut the interlock devices were unpopular with the public,\nand Congress soon forbade the agency to make them a\nmeans of compliance. Geier, supra, at 876; Motor Vehicle\nand Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, \u00a7109, 88 Stat.\n1482 (previously codified at 15 U. S. C. \u00a71410(b) (1988\ned.)). DOT then temporarily switched to the use of dem\nonstration projects, but later it returned to mandating\npassive restraints, again leaving manufacturers with a\nchoice of systems. Geier, supra, at 876\u2013877; see 49 Fed.\nReg. 28962 (1984).\n   DOT\u2019s contemporaneous explanation of its 1984 regula\ntion made clear that manufacturer choice was an impor\ntant means for achieving its basic objectives. The 1984\nregulation gradually phased in passive restraint require\nments, initially requiring manufacturers to equip only\n10% of their new fleets with passive restraints. DOT\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that it intended its phasing period partly to give\nmanufacturers time to improve airbag technology and to\ndevelop \u201cother, better\u201d passive restraint systems. Geier,\n529 U. S., at 879. DOT further explained that it had\nrejected an \u201c \u2018all airbag\u2019 \u201d system. Ibid. It was worried\nthat requiring airbags in most or all vehicles would cause\na public backlash, like the backlash against interlock\ndevices. Ibid. DOT also had concerns about the safety of\nairbags, for they could injure out-of-place occupants, par\nticularly children. Id., at 877\u2013878. And, given the cost of\nairbags, vehicle owners might not replace them when\nnecessary, leaving occupants without passive protection.\nIbid. The regulation therefore \u201cdeliberately sought vari\nety\u2014a mix of several different passive restraint systems.\u201d\nId., at 878. DOT hoped that this mix would lead to better\ninformation about the devices\u2019 comparative effectiveness\nand to the eventual development of \u201calternative, cheaper,\nand safer passive restraint systems.\u201d Id., at 879.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General told us that a tort suit that\ninsisted upon use of airbags, as opposed to other federally\npermissible passive restraint systems, would \u201cstan[d] as\nan obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these\nobjectives.\u201d Id., at 883 (quoting Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,\nO. T. 1999, No. 98\u20131811, pp. 25\u201326 (hereinafter United\nStates Brief in Geier) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAnd we gave weight to the Solicitor General\u2019s view in light\nof the fact that it \u201c \u2018embodie[d] the Secretary\u2019s policy judg\nment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers\ninstalled alternative protection systems in their fleets\nrather than one particular system in every car.\u2019 \u201d 529\nU. S., at 881 (quoting United States Brief in Geier 25\u201326).\n   Taken together, this history, the agency\u2019s contempora\nneous explanation, and the Government\u2019s current under\nstanding of the regulation convinced us that manufacturer\nchoice was an important regulatory objective. And since\n8     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\nthat objective, we found the tort suit pre-empted.\n                              B\n   We turn now to the present case. Like the regulation in\nGeier, the regulation here leaves the manufacturer with a\nchoice. And, like the tort suit in Geier, the tort suit here\nwould restrict that choice. But unlike Geier, we do not\nbelieve here that choice is a significant regulatory objec\ntive.\n   We concede that the history of the regulation before us\nresembles the history of airbags to some degree. In 1984,\nDOT rejected a regulation that would have required the\nuse of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats. 49 Fed. Reg.\n15241. Nonetheless, by 1989 when DOT promulgated the\npresent regulation, it had \u201cconcluded that several factors\nhad changed.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.\n   DOT then required manufacturers to install a particular\nkind of belt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, for rear outer\nseats. In respect to rear inner seats, it retained manufac\nturer choice as to which kind of belt to install. But its\n1989 reasons for retaining that choice differed considera\nbly from its 1984 reasons for permitting manufacturers a\nchoice in respect to airbags. DOT here was not concerned\nabout consumer acceptance; it was convinced that lap-and\nshoulder belts would increase safety; it did not fear addi\ntional safety risks arising from use of those belts; it had\nno interest in assuring a mix of devices; and, though it\nwas concerned about additional costs, that concern was\ndiminishing.\n   In respect to consumer acceptance, DOT wrote that if\n    \u201cpeople who are familiar with and in the habit of\n    wearing lap/shoulder belts in the front seat find\n    lap/shoulder belts in the rear seat, it stands to reason\n    that they would be more likely to wear those belts\n    when riding in the rear seat.\u201d 53 Fed. Reg. 47983\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    (1988).\n   In respect to safety, DOT wrote that, because an in\ncreasing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts,\nrear seat lap-and-shoulder belts would have \u201cprogressively\ngreater actual safety benefits.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.\nIt added:\n    \u201c[s]tudies of occupant protection from 1968 forward\n    show that the lap-only safety belts installed in rear\n    seating positions are effective in reducing the risk of\n    death and injury. . . . However, the agency believes\n    that rear-seat lap/shoulder safety belts would be even\n    more effective.\u201d Ibid.\n  Five years earlier, DOT had expressed concern that lap\nand-shoulder belts might negatively impact child safety by\ninterfering with the use of certain child car seats that\nrelied upon a tether. But by 1989, DOT found that car\nseat designs \u201chad shifted away\u201d from tethers. 53 Fed. Reg.\n47983. And rear lap-and-shoulder belts could therefore\noffer safety benefits for children old enough to use them\nwithout diminishing the safety of smaller children in car\nseats. Id., at 47988\u201347989 (\u201c[T]he agency believes that\nthis proposal for rear seat lap/shoulder belts would offer\nbenefits for children riding in some types of booster seats,\nwould have no positive or negative effects on children\nriding in most designs of car seats and children that are\ntoo small to use shoulder belts, and would offer older\nchildren the same incremental safety protection [as\nadults]\u201d). Nor did DOT seek to use its regulation to spur\nthe development of alternative kinds of rear aisle or mid\ndle seat safety devices. See 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.\n  Why then did DOT not require lap-and-shoulder belts in\nthese seats? We have found some indication that it\nthought use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear aisle seats\ncould cause \u201centry and exit problems for occupants of\nseating positions to the rear\u201d by \u201cstretch[ing] the shoulder\n10     WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelt across the aisleway,\u201d id., at 46258. However, DOT\nencouraged manufacturers to address this issue through\ninnovation:\n     \u201c[I]n those cases where manufacturers are able to de\n     sign and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions\n     adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the\n     aisleway\u2019s purpose of allowing access to more rear\n     ward seating positions[, the agency] encourages the\n     manufacturers to do so.\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. 46258.\nAnd there is little indication that DOT considered this\nmatter a significant safety concern. Cf. Letter from Philip\nR. Recht, Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdmin., to Roger Matoba (Dec. 28, 1994), App. to Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 2 (\u201cWith respect to your concerns\nabout the safety of shoulder safety belts which cross an\naisle, I note that such belts do not in fact prevent rear\nward passengers from exiting the vehicle. Such passen\ngers may . . . g[o] under or over the belt. They may also\nmove the belt aside\u201d).\n  The more important reason why DOT did not require\nlap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats was that it\nthought that this requirement would not be cost-effective.\nThe agency explained that it would be significantly more\nexpensive for manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder\nbelts in rear middle and aisle seats than in seats next to\nthe car doors. Ibid. But that fact\u2014the fact that DOT\nmade a negative judgment about cost effectiveness\u2014\ncannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common\nlaw tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a\ndifferent conclusion.\n  For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would\nremain frozen. Rather it pointed out that costs were\nfalling as manufacturers were \u201cvoluntarily equipping more\nand more of their vehicles with rear seat lap/shoulder\nbelts.\u201d Ibid. For another thing, many, perhaps most,\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal safety regulations embody some kind of cost\neffectiveness judgment. While an agency could base a\ndecision to pre-empt on its cost-effectiveness judgment, we\nare satisfied that the rulemaking record at issue here\ndiscloses no such pre-emptive intent. And to infer from\nthe mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment\nthat the federal agency intends to bar States from impos\ning stricter standards would treat all such federal stan\ndards as if they were maximum standards, eliminating the\npossibility that the federal agency seeks only to set forth a\nminimum standard potentially supplemented through\nstate tort law. We cannot reconcile this consequence with\na statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a\ncontinued meaningful role for state tort law. Supra, at 4.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General tells us that DOT\u2019s regula\ntion does not pre-empt this tort suit. As in Geier, \u201cthe\nagency\u2019s own views should make a difference.\u201d 529 U. S.,\nat 883.\n    \u201cCongress has delegated to DOT authority to imple\n    ment the statute; the subject matter is technical; and\n    the relevant history and background are complex and\n    extensive. The agency is likely to have a thorough\n    understanding of its own regulation and its objectives\n    and is \u2018uniquely qualified\u2019 to comprehend the likely\n    impact of state requirements.\u201d Ibid.\nThere is \u201cno reason to suspect that the Solicitor General\u2019s\nrepresentation of DOT\u2019s views reflects anything other than\n\u2018the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the mat\nter.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 884 (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452,\n462 (1997)).\n   Neither has DOT expressed inconsistent views on this\nsubject. In Geier, the Solicitor General pointed out that\n\u201cstate tort law does not conflict with a federal \u2018minimum\nstandard\u2019 merely because state law imposes a more strin\ngent requirement.\u201d United States Brief in Geier 21 (cita\n12    WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion omitted). And the Solicitor General explained that a\nstandard giving manufacturers \u201cmultiple options for the\ndesign of\u201d a device would not pre-empt a suit claiming that\na manufacturer should have chosen one particular option,\nwhere \u201cthe Secretary did not determine that the availabil\nity of options was necessary to promote safety.\u201d Id., at 22;\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Wood v.\nGeneral Motors Corp., O. T. 1989, No. 89\u201346, p. 15. This\nlast statement describes the present case.\n\n   In Geier, then, the regulation\u2019s history, the agency\u2019s\ncontemporaneous explanation, and its consistently held\ninterpretive views indicated that the regulation sought to\nmaintain manufacturer choice in order to further signifi\ncant regulatory objectives. Here, these same considera\ntions indicate the contrary. We consequently conclude\nthat, even though the state tort suit may restrict the\nmanufacturer\u2019s choice, it does not \u201cstan[d] as an obstacle\nto the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and objec\ntives\u201d of federal law. Hines, 312 U. S., at 67. Thus, the\nregulation does not pre-empt this tort action.\n\n  The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is re\nversed.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

In other words, the mere fact that an\nagency regulation allows manufacturers a choice between\noptions is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption;\ncourts should only find pre-emption where evidence exists\nthat an agency has a regulatory objective\u2014e.g., obtaining\na mix of passive restraint mechanisms, as in Geier\u2014whose\nachievement depends on manufacturers having a choice\nbetween options.

I agree. But\nI reach this result by a more direct route: the Safety Act\u2019s\nsaving clause, which speaks directly to this question and\nanswers it. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a730103(e).\n                                I\n   The plain text of the Safety Act resolves this case.\nCongress has instructed that \u201c[c]ompliance with a motor\nvehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does\nnot exempt a person from liability at common law.\u201d Ibid.\nThis saving clause \u201cexplicitly preserv[es] state common\nlaw actions.\u201d Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18).\nHere, Mazda complied with FMVSS 208 when it chose to\ninstall a simple lap belt. According to Mazda, the Wil\nliamsons\u2019 lawsuit alleging that it should have installed a\nlap-and-shoulder seatbelt instead is pre-empted. That\nargument is foreclosed by the saving clause; the William\nsons\u2019 state tort action is not pre-empted.\n   The majority does not rely on the Safety Act\u2019s saving\nclause because this Court effectively read it out of the\n2      WILLIAMSON v. MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC.\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstatute in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.\n861 (2000). In Geier, the Court interpreted the saving\nclause as simply cancelling out the statute\u2019s express pre\nemption clause with respect to common-law tort actions.\nThis left the Court free to consider the effect of conflict\npre-emption principles on such tort actions. See id., at\n869.\n  But it makes no sense to read the express pre-emption\nclause in conjunction with the saving clause. See id., at\n898 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The express pre-emption\nclause bars States from having any safety \u201cstandard appli\ncable to the same aspect of performance\u201d as a federal\nstandard unless it is \u201cidentical\u201d to the federal one.\n\u00a730103(b). That clause pre-empts States from establish\ning \u201cobjective rule[s] prescribed by a legislature or an\nadministrative agency\u201d in competition with the federal\nstandards; it says nothing about the tort lawsuits that are\nthe focus of the saving clause. Id., at 896.* Read inde\npendently of the express pre-emption clause, the saving\nclause simply means what it says: FMVSS 208 does not\npre-empt state common-law actions.\n                             II\n  As in Geier, rather than following the plain text of the\nstatute, the majority\u2019s analysis turns on whether the tort\nlawsuit here \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplish\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d\nof FMVSS 208.

Wyeth, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 23) (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The Court\nwades into a sea of agency musings and Government\nlitigating positions and fishes for what the agency may\nhave been thinking 20 years ago when it drafted the rele\nvant provision. After scrutinizing the 1989 Federal Regis\nter, a letter written in 1994, and the Solicitor General\u2019s\npresent-day assurances, the Court finds that Department\nof Transportation liked the idea of lap-and-shoulder seat\nbelts in all seats, but did not require them, primarily for\ncost-efficiency reasons and also because of some concern\nfor ingress-egress around the belt mounts. Ante, at 8\u201311.\nFrom all of this, the majority determines that although\nthe regulators specifically and intentionally gave manu\nfacturers a choice between types of seatbelts, that choice\nwas not a \u201csignificant regulatory objective\u201d and so does not\npre-empt state tort lawsuits.\n   That the Court in Geier reached an opposite conclusion\nreveals the utterly unconstrained nature of purposes-and\nobjectives pre-emption. There is certainly \u201cconsiderable\nsimilarity between this case and Geier.\u201d Ante, at 2.

United States v. Public Util.\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 345 U. S. 295, 319 (1953) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring) (describing reliance on legislative history).\nThe majority cites no difference on the face of FMVSS 208\nbetween the airbag choice addressed in Geier and the\nseatbelt choice at issue in this case.\n  According to the majority, to determine whether FMVSS\n208 pre-empts a tort suit, courts apparently must embark\non the same expedition undertaken here: sifting through\nthe Federal Register, examining agency ruminations, and\nasking the Government what it currently thinks. Pre\nemption is then proper if the court decides that the regula\ntors thought the choice especially important, but not if the\nchoice was only somewhat important. This quest roves far\nfrom the Safety Act and analyzes pre-emption based on a\nformless inquiry into how strongly an agency felt about\nthe regulation it enacted 20 years ago.\n  \u201c[F]reeranging speculation about what the purposes of\nthe [regulation] must have been\u201d is not constitutionally\nproper in any case.

The Supremacy Clause com\nmands that the \u201c[l]aws of the United States,\u201d not the\nunenacted hopes and dreams of the Department of Trans\nportation, \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Art. VI, cl. 2. The impropriety is even more obvi\nous here because the plain text of the Safety Act resolves\nthis case.\n  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n</pre>",
