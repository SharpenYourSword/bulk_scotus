A prisoner must seek habeas relief without “sub\n stantial delay,” e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 3d, at 317, as\n “measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasona\n bly should have known, of the information offered in support of the\n claim and the legal basis of the claim,” id., at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n All California courts have “original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\n ceedings.” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10. Because a habeas petitioner\n may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Su\n preme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas peti\n tions each year. A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means\n that the petition is rejected as untimely. California courts, however,\n have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily\n reject the petition for want of merit.\n    Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was\n sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su\n preme Court denied Martin’s first state habeas petition, he filed a\n federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit\n Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of\n counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those\n claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,\n2                          WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until\n    nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. The\n    California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Rob\n    bins. Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an\n    amended federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed his\n    belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law. The\n    Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to\n    determine the “adequacy” of the State’s time bar. Again rejecting\n    Martin’s petition, the District Court found California’s bar an ade\n    quate state ground for denying Martin’s new pleas. Concluding that\n    the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth\n    Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin’s\n    claims.\nHeld: California’s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent\n state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.\n Pp. 7–13.\n    (a) Absent showings of “cause” and “prejudice,” see Wainwright v.\n Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, federal habeas relief will be unavailable\n when (1) “a state court [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal\n claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural re\n quirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on independent and\n adequate state procedural grounds,” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n 722, 729–730. P. 7.\n    (b) A “rule can be ‘firmly established’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” and\n therefore adequate, “even if the appropriate exercise of discretion\n may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\n others.” Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___. California’s time rule,\n although discretionary, meets this “firmly established” criterion. The\n California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of\n cases, instructing habeas petitioners to “alleg[e] with specificity” the\n absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for\n one of four exceptions to the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838,\n 959 P. 2d, at 299. And California’s case law made it plain that Mar\n tin’s nearly five-year delay was “substantial.” See, e.g., id., at 829–\n 831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P. 2d, at 293–294, 299, and n. 13. The Court\n finds unpersuasive Martin’s argument that the terms “reasonable\n time” period and “substantial delay” make California’s rule too vague\n to be regarded as “firmly established.” While indeterminate language\n is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particu\n lar circumstances can supply the requisite clarity. Congressional\n statutes and this Court’s decisions have employed time limitations\n that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. For example, current\n federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one\n year. The clock runs from “the date on which the [supporting] facts\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  . . . could have been discovered through . . . due diligence.” 28\n  U. S. C. §2255(f)(4). Although “ ‘due diligence’ is an inexact measure\n  of how much delay is too much,” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.\n  295, 309, n. 7, “use of an imprecise standard is no justification for de\n  priving [a rule’s] language of any meaning,” ibid. Nor is California’s\n  time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.\n  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies\n  hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary\n  to Martin’s argument, California’s time bar is not infirm simply be\n  cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and\n  summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.\n  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a\n  showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre\n  tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to\n  avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an\n  unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a\n  court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,\n  but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7–12.\n      (c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court’s repeated recognition\n  that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require\n  ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against\n  claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,\n  338 U. S. 294, 298–299. On the record here, however, there is no ba\n  sis for concluding that California’s rule operates in such a discrimina\n  tory manner. P. 13.\n357 Fed.

The\nquestion presented: Does California’s timeliness require\nment qualify as an independent state ground adequate to\nbar habeas corpus relief in federal court?\n   California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to\ndetermine the timeliness of a state prisoner’s petition for\nhabeas corpus. Instead, California directs petitioners to\nfile known claims “as promptly as the circumstances al\nlow.” In re Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113311/in-re-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729,\n738, n. 5 (1993).

Ibid.; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th,\nat 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at 738, n. 5.\n   California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied\nas untimely by citing the controlling decisions, i.e., Clark\nand Robbins.

MARTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on\nthe merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see Harrington v. Richter,\nante, at 9–10. California courts may elect to pretermit the\nquestion whether a petition is timely and simply deny the\npetition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.\n   Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin,\npresented the claims at issue—all alleging ineffective\nassistance of counsel—in a habeas petition filed in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court nearly five years after his con\nviction became final. He stated no reason for the long\ndelay. Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Mar\ntin’s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the\nEastern District of California dismissed Martin’s federal\nhabeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance\nclaims. Denial of Martin’s state-court petition as un\ntimely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground, i.e., Martin’s failure to seek\nrelief in state court “without substantial delay.” See\nRobbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re\nversed the District Court’s decision. Contrasting the\nprecision of “fixed statutory deadlines” with California’s\nproscription of “substantial delay,” the appeals court held\nthat California’s standard lacked the clarity and certainty\nnecessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 357 Fed.\nAppx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on Townsend v. Knowles,\n562 F. 3d 1200 (CA9 2009)).\n   In a recent decision, Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009), this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may\ncount as an adequate and independent ground for denying\na federal habeas petition even if the state court had dis\ncretion to reach the merits despite the default. Guided by\nthat decision, we hold that California is not put to the\nchoice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions\n(which would almost certainly rule out Martin’s nearly\nfive-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

In so\nruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that Califor\nnia’s time bar, either by design or in operation, discrimi\nnates against federal claims or claimants.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   While most States set determinate time limits for collat\neral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor\nrule of court does so. Instead, California courts “appl[y] a\ngeneral ‘reasonableness’ standard” to judge whether a\nhabeas petition is timely filed. Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S.\n214, 222 (2002). The basic instruction provided by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is simply that “a [habeas] peti\ntion should be filed as promptly as the circumstances\nallow . . . .” Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at\n738, n. 5.\n   Three leading decisions describe California’s timeliness\nrequirement: Robbins, Clark, and In re Gallego, 18 Cal.\n4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290 (1998). A prisoner must seek ha\nbeas relief without “substantial delay,” Robbins, 18 Cal.\n4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317; Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 833,\n959 P. 2d, at 296; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 783, 855 P. 2d, at\n750, as “measured from the time the petitioner or counsel\nknew, or reasonably should have known, of the informa\ntion offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for\nthe claim,” Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\nPetitioners in noncapital cases have “the burden of estab\nlishing (i) absence of substantial delay, (ii) good cause for\nthe delay, or (iii) that the claim falls within an exception\nto the bar of untimeliness.” Id., at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.1\n——————\n  1A    petition for habeas relief in a capital case is “presumed to be filed\nwithout substantial delay if it is filed within 180 days after the final\ndue date for the filing of [an] appellant’s reply brief on the direct appeal\n. . . .” California Supreme Court Policies Regarding Cases Arising From\n4                       WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   California’s collateral review regime differs from that of\nother States in a second notable respect: All California\ncourts “have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\nceedings,” Cal. Const., Art.

Martin fled the State,\nbut eight years later he was extradited to California to\nstand trial. Convicted in state court of murder and rob\nbery, Martin was sentenced to life in prison without the\npossibility of parole. In 1997, the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied review.\n   Martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceed\nings in 1998, and the next year, the California Supreme\nCourt denied his petition. He then filed a habeas petition\nin the appropriate U. S. District Court. Finding that\nMartin’s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims he had not aired in state court, the District\nCourt stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin’s\nreturn to state court to exhaust his remedies there.3\n   In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition\nin the California Supreme Court, raising the federal in\neffective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted. He\ngave no reason for his failure to assert the additional\nclaims until nearly five years after his sentence and con\nviction became final. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 39. In Septem\nber 2002, the California Supreme Court denied Martin’s\npetition in an order typical of that court’s summary dispo\nsitions for failure to file “as promptly as the circumstances\n\n——————\n  3 Rather than dismiss a petition containing both exhausted and un\n\nexhausted claims, “a district court might stay the petition and hold it in\nabeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his\npreviously unexhausted claims.

Controlled by its\nprior decision in Townsend, 562 F. 3d, at 1207–1208, the\nCourt of Appeals held that California’s time bar “has yet\nto be firmly defined” and was not shown by the State to be\n“consistently applied.” 357 Fed.

Martin does not here dispute that the\ntime limitation is an “independent” state ground. See\nBrief in Opposition 5–6. See also Bennett v. Mueller, 322\nF. 3d 573, 582–583 (CA9 2003).

S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991)). The state-law\nground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case,\nor a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the\nmerits. See Sykes, 433 U. S., at 81–82, 90.\n   Ordinarily, a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief\nmust first “exhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts\nof the State,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A), thereby affording\nthose courts “the first opportunity to address and correct\nalleged violations of [the] prisoner’s federal rights,” Cole\nman, 501 U. S., at 731. The adequate and independent\nstate ground doctrine furthers that objective, for without\nit, “habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaus\ntion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in\nstate court.” Id., at 732. Accordingly, absent showings of\n“cause” and “prejudice,” see Sykes, 433 U. S., at 84–85,\nfederal habeas relief will be unavailable when (1) “a state\ncourt [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal claims\nbecause the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural\nrequirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on inde\npendent and adequate state procedural grounds.” Cole\nman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.\n                            B\n  To qualify as an “adequate” procedural ground, a state\nrule must be “firmly established and regularly followed. ”\n8                        WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nKindler, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).4 “[A] discretionary state procedural rule,”\nwe held in Kindler, “can serve as an adequate ground to\nbar federal habeas review.” Ibid. A “rule can be ‘firmly\nestablished’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” Kindler observed,\n“even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit\nconsideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\nothers.” Ibid.\n   California’s time rule, although discretionary, meets the\n“firmly established” criterion, as Kindler comprehended\nthat requirement. The California Supreme Court, as\nearlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for ha\nbeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See supra, at 3.\nThose decisions instruct habeas petitioners to “alleg[e]\nwith specificity” the absence of substantial delay, good\ncause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to\nthe time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P. 2d, at\n299; see Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.5\n——————\n    4 Wehave also recognized a “limited category” of “exceptional cases in\nwhich exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state\nground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.” Lee v.\nKemna, 534 U. S. 362, 376 (2002). In Lee, for example, the defendant\nunsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to\nhim, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled\nto testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state\ncourt’s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements\nfor continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied\nwith the rule’s key requirement and flawless compliance would have\nbeen unavailing given the trial court’s reason for denying the motion.\nSee id., at 381–382. Martin does not suggest that the application of\nCalifornia’s timeliness rule in his case falls within the exceptional\ncategory Lee described and illustrated. See Brief for Respondent 28, 29,\n54.\n   5 An untimely petition “will be entertained on the merits if the peti\n\ntioner demonstrates (i) that error of constitutional magnitude led to a\ntrial that was so fundamentally unfair that absent the error no reason\nable judge or jury would have convicted the petitioner; (ii) that the\npetitioner is actually innocent of the crime or crimes of which he or she\nwas convicted; (iii) that the death penalty was imposed by a sentencing\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

We disagree. Indetermi\nnate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica\ntion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,\ncan supply the requisite clarity.\n   Congressional statutes and this Court’s decisions, we\nnote, have employed time limitations that are not stated\nin precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas\nCorpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on\nsubmission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis\nmissal of a state prisoner’s petition when it appeared that\ndelay in commencing litigation “prejudiced [the State] in\nits ability to respond.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 9(a) (1994\ned.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show\nthat he could not earlier have known, “by the exercise of\nreasonable diligence,” the grounds on which he based the\npetition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.

But “use of an\nimprecise standard,” we immediately added, “is no justifi\ncation for depriving [a rule’s] language of any meaning.”\nIbid. “[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard\nstate procedural rules that are substantially similar to\nthose to which we give full force in our own courts.” Kind-\nler, 558 U.

Each year, the California\nSupreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas\npetitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Brief for Appellant\nin No. 08–15752 (CA9), pp. 31–32. On the same day the\ncourt denied Martin’s petition, it issued 21 other\nClark/Robbins summary denials. See Brief for Habeas\nCorpus Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20.

See\nPrihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)\n(“Uncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state’s\nprocedural ground as one ‘adequate’ under federal law. If\nit were, states would be induced to make their rules\ndraconian . . . .”).\n   A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate\nwhen “discretion has been exercised to impose novel and\nunforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial\nsupport in prior state law . . . .” 16B C. Wright, A. Miller,\n& E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §4026, p. 386\n(2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright & Miller); see Prihoda,\n910 F. 2d, at 1383 (state ground “applied infrequently,\nunexpectedly, or freakishly” may “discriminat[e] against\nthe federal rights asserted” and therefore rank as “inade\nquate”). Martin does not contend, however, that in his\ncase, the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion\nin a surprising or unfair manner.\n   “[S]ound procedure often requires discretion to exact or\nexcuse compliance with strict rules,” 16B Wright & Miller\n§4028, p. 403, and we have no cause to discourage stan\ndards allowing courts to exercise such discretion. As this\nCourt observed in Kindler, if forced to choose between\nmandatory rules certain to be found “adequate,” or more\nsupple prescriptions that federal courts may disregard as\n“inadequate,” “many States [might] opt for mandatory\nrules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary fed\neral review.” 558 U.

Argued November 29, 2010—Decided February 23, 2011\nWhile most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief appli\n cations, California courts “appl[y] a general ‘reasonableness’ stan\n dard” to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed, Carey v. Saf\n fold, 536 U. S. 214, 222. Under that standard, “a [habeas] petition\n should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow . . . ,” In re\n Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729, 738, n. 5. Three deci\n sions, Clark, In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P. 2d 311, and In re\n Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290, describe California’s timeli\n ness requirement. A prisoner must seek habeas relief without “sub\n stantial delay,” e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 3d, at 317, as\n “measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasona\n bly should have known, of the information offered in support of the\n claim and the legal basis of the claim,” id., at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n All California courts have “original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\n ceedings.” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10. Because a habeas petitioner\n may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Su\n preme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas peti\n tions each year. A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means\n that the petition is rejected as untimely. California courts, however,\n have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily\n reject the petition for want of merit.\n    Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was\n sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su\n preme Court denied Martin’s first state habeas petition, he filed a\n federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit\n Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of\n counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those\n claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,\n2                          WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until\n    nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. The\n    California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Rob\n    bins. Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an\n    amended federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed his\n    belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law. The\n    Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to\n    determine the “adequacy” of the State’s time bar. Again rejecting\n    Martin’s petition, the District Court found California’s bar an ade\n    quate state ground for denying Martin’s new pleas. Concluding that\n    the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth\n    Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin’s\n    claims.\nHeld: California’s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent\n state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.\n Pp. 7–13.\n    (a) Absent showings of “cause” and “prejudice,” see Wainwright v.\n Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, federal habeas relief will be unavailable\n when (1) “a state court [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal\n claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural re\n quirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on independent and\n adequate state procedural grounds,” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n 722, 729–730. P. 7.\n    (b) A “rule can be ‘firmly established’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” and\n therefore adequate, “even if the appropriate exercise of discretion\n may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\n others.” Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___. California’s time rule,\n although discretionary, meets this “firmly established” criterion. The\n California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of\n cases, instructing habeas petitioners to “alleg[e] with specificity” the\n absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for\n one of four exceptions to the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838,\n 959 P. 2d, at 299. And California’s case law made it plain that Mar\n tin’s nearly five-year delay was “substantial.” See, e.g., id., at 829–\n 831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P. 2d, at 293–294, 299, and n. 13. The Court\n finds unpersuasive Martin’s argument that the terms “reasonable\n time” period and “substantial delay” make California’s rule too vague\n to be regarded as “firmly established.” While indeterminate language\n is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particu\n lar circumstances can supply the requisite clarity. Congressional\n statutes and this Court’s decisions have employed time limitations\n that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. For example, current\n federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one\n year. The clock runs from “the date on which the [supporting] facts\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Although “ ‘due diligence’ is an inexact measure\n  of how much delay is too much,” Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.\n  295, 309, n. 7, “use of an imprecise standard is no justification for de\n  priving [a rule’s] language of any meaning,” ibid. Nor is California’s\n  time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.\n  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies\n  hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary\n  to Martin’s argument, California’s time bar is not infirm simply be\n  cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and\n  summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.\n  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a\n  showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre\n  tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to\n  avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an\n  unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a\n  court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,\n  but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7–12.\n      (c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court’s repeated recognition\n  that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require\n  ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against\n  claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,\n  338 U. S. 294, 298–299.

The\nquestion presented: Does California’s timeliness require\nment qualify as an independent state ground adequate to\nbar habeas corpus relief in federal court?\n   California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to\ndetermine the timeliness of a state prisoner’s petition for\nhabeas corpus. Instead, California directs petitioners to\nfile known claims “as promptly as the circumstances al\nlow.” In re Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729,\n738, n. 5 (1993). Petitioners are further instructed to state\nwhen they first learned of the asserted claims and to\nexplain why they did not seek postconviction relief sooner.\nIn re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780, 959 P. 2d 311, 317–\n318 (1998). Claims substantially delayed without justifi\ncation may be denied as untimely. Ibid.; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th,\nat 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at 738, n. 5.\n   California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied\nas untimely by citing the controlling decisions, i.e., Clark\nand Robbins. A spare order denying a petition without\n2                   WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on\nthe merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see Harrington v. Richter,\nante, at 9–10. California courts may elect to pretermit the\nquestion whether a petition is timely and simply deny the\npetition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.\n   Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin,\npresented the claims at issue—all alleging ineffective\nassistance of counsel—in a habeas petition filed in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court nearly five years after his con\nviction became final. He stated no reason for the long\ndelay. Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Mar\ntin’s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the\nEastern District of California dismissed Martin’s federal\nhabeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance\nclaims. Denial of Martin’s state-court petition as un\ntimely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground, i.e., Martin’s failure to seek\nrelief in state court “without substantial delay.” See\nRobbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re\nversed the District Court’s decision. Contrasting the\nprecision of “fixed statutory deadlines” with California’s\nproscription of “substantial delay,” the appeals court held\nthat California’s standard lacked the clarity and certainty\nnecessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 357 Fed.\nAppx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on Townsend v. Knowles,\n562 F. 3d 1200 (CA9 2009)).\n   In a recent decision, Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009), this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may\ncount as an adequate and independent ground for denying\na federal habeas petition even if the state court had dis\ncretion to reach the merits despite the default. Guided by\nthat decision, we hold that California is not put to the\nchoice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions\n(which would almost certainly rule out Martin’s nearly\nfive-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

In so\nruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that Califor\nnia’s time bar, either by design or in operation, discrimi\nnates against federal claims or claimants.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   While most States set determinate time limits for collat\neral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor\nrule of court does so. Instead, California courts “appl[y] a\ngeneral ‘reasonableness’ standard” to judge whether a\nhabeas petition is timely filed. Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S.\n214, 222 (2002). The basic instruction provided by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is simply that “a [habeas] peti\ntion should be filed as promptly as the circumstances\nallow . . . .” Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at\n738, n. 5.\n   Three leading decisions describe California’s timeliness\nrequirement: Robbins, Clark, and In re Gallego, 18 Cal.\n4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290 (1998). A prisoner must seek ha\nbeas relief without “substantial delay,” Robbins, 18 Cal.\n4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317; Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 833,\n959 P. 2d, at 296; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 783, 855 P. 2d, at\n750, as “measured from the time the petitioner or counsel\nknew, or reasonably should have known, of the informa\ntion offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for\nthe claim,” Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\nPetitioners in noncapital cases have “the burden of estab\nlishing (i) absence of substantial delay, (ii) good cause for\nthe delay, or (iii) that the claim falls within an exception\nto the bar of untimeliness.” Id., at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.1\n——————\n  1A    petition for habeas relief in a capital case is “presumed to be filed\nwithout substantial delay if it is filed within 180 days after the final\ndue date for the filing of [an] appellant’s reply brief on the direct appeal\n. . . .” California Supreme Court Policies Regarding Cases Arising From\n4                       WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   California’s collateral review regime differs from that of\nother States in a second notable respect: All California\ncourts “have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\nceedings,” Cal. Const., Art. VI, §10, thus “no appeal lies\nfrom the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,”\nClark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 767, n. 7, 855 P. 2d, at 740, n. 7. “[A]\nprisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior\ncourt can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a\nnew petition in the Court of Appeal.” Ibid. The new\npetition, however, must be confined to claims raised in the\ninitial petition. See In re Martinez, 46 Cal. 4th 945, 956,\n209 P. 3d 908, 915 (2009).\n   Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower\ncourts and file directly in the California Supreme Court,\nIn re Kler, 188 Cal. App. 4th 1399, 1403, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n889, 891–892 (2010), that court rules on a staggering\nnumber of habeas petitions each year.2 The court issues\ngenerally unelaborated “summary denials” of petitions\nthat “d[o] not state a prima facie case for relief” or that\ncontain “claims [that] are all procedurally barred.” People\nv. Romero, 8 Cal. 4th 728, 737, 883 P. 2d 388, 391 (1994)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A summary denial\nciting Clark and Robbins means that the petition is re\njected as untimely.

Martin fled the State,\nbut eight years later he was extradited to California to\nstand trial. Convicted in state court of murder and rob\nbery, Martin was sentenced to life in prison without the\npossibility of parole. In 1997, the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied review.\n   Martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceed\nings in 1998, and the next year, the California Supreme\nCourt denied his petition. He then filed a habeas petition\nin the appropriate U. S. District Court. Finding that\nMartin’s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims he had not aired in state court, the District\nCourt stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin’s\nreturn to state court to exhaust his remedies there.3\n   In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition\nin the California Supreme Court, raising the federal in\neffective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted. He\ngave no reason for his failure to assert the additional\nclaims until nearly five years after his sentence and con\nviction became final. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 39. In Septem\nber 2002, the California Supreme Court denied Martin’s\npetition in an order typical of that court’s summary dispo\nsitions for failure to file “as promptly as the circumstances\n\n——————\n  3 Rather than dismiss a petition containing both exhausted and un\n\nexhausted claims, “a district court might stay the petition and hold it in\nabeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his\npreviously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner exhausts his state\nremedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to\nproceed in federal court.” Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.

The order read in its entirety: “Petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus is DENIED. (See In re Clark (1993) 5 Cal.\n4th 750, In re Robbins (1998) 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780.).” See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 60.\n  Having exhausted state postconviction remedies, Martin\nreturned to federal court and filed an amended petition.\nBased upon the California Supreme Court’s time-bar\ndisposition, the District Court dismissed Martin’s belat\nedly asserted claims as procedurally precluded. Id., at 27,\n57. The Ninth Circuit vacated the dismissal order and\nremanded the case, directing the District Court to deter\nmine the “adequacy” of the State’s time bar. Martin v.\nHubbard, 192 Fed. Appx. 616, 618 (2006). The District\nCourt again rejected Martin’s petition, stating that “[t]he\nCalifornia timeliness bar as set forth in . . . Clark/Robbins\nis clearly defined, well established and consistently ap\nplied.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4.\n  The Ninth Circuit again disagreed. Controlled by its\nprior decision in Townsend, 562 F. 3d, at 1207–1208, the\nCourt of Appeals held that California’s time bar “has yet\nto be firmly defined” and was not shown by the State to be\n“consistently applied.” 357 Fed. Appx., at 794. The re\nmand order directed the District Court to determine the\nmerits of the claims Martin asserted in his second petition\nto the California Supreme Court.\n  We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), to determine\nthe “adequacy” of California’s practice under which a\nprisoner may be barred from collaterally attacking his\nconviction when he has “substantially delayed” filing his\nhabeas petition. Martin does not here dispute that the\ntime limitation is an “independent” state ground. See\nBrief in Opposition 5–6. See also Bennett v. Mueller, 322\nF. 3d 573, 582–583 (CA9 2003).

S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991)). The state-law\nground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case,\nor a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the\nmerits. See Sykes, 433 U. S., at 81–82, 90.\n   Ordinarily, a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief\nmust first “exhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts\nof the State,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A), thereby affording\nthose courts “the first opportunity to address and correct\nalleged violations of [the] prisoner’s federal rights,” Cole\nman, 501 U. S., at 731. The adequate and independent\nstate ground doctrine furthers that objective, for without\nit, “habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaus\ntion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in\nstate court.” Id., at 732. Accordingly, absent showings of\n“cause” and “prejudice,” see Sykes, 433 U. S., at 84–85,\nfederal habeas relief will be unavailable when (1) “a state\ncourt [has] declined to address a prisoner’s federal claims\nbecause the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural\nrequirement,” and (2) “the state judgment rests on inde\npendent and adequate state procedural grounds.” Cole\nman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.\n                            B\n  To qualify as an “adequate” procedural ground, a state\nrule must be “firmly established and regularly followed. ”\n8                        WALKER v.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).4 “[A] discretionary state procedural rule,”\nwe held in Kindler, “can serve as an adequate ground to\nbar federal habeas review.” Ibid. A “rule can be ‘firmly\nestablished’ and ‘regularly followed,’ ” Kindler observed,\n“even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit\nconsideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\nothers.” Ibid.\n   California’s time rule, although discretionary, meets the\n“firmly established” criterion, as Kindler comprehended\nthat requirement. The California Supreme Court, as\nearlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for ha\nbeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See supra, at 3.\nThose decisions instruct habeas petitioners to “alleg[e]\nwith specificity” the absence of substantial delay, good\ncause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to\nthe time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P. 2d, at\n299; see Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.5\n——————\n    4 Wehave also recognized a “limited category” of “exceptional cases in\nwhich exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state\nground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.” Lee v.\nKemna, 534 U. S. 362, 376 (2002). In Lee, for example, the defendant\nunsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to\nhim, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled\nto testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state\ncourt’s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements\nfor continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied\nwith the rule’s key requirement and flawless compliance would have\nbeen unavailing given the trial court’s reason for denying the motion.\nSee id., at 381–382. Martin does not suggest that the application of\nCalifornia’s timeliness rule in his case falls within the exceptional\ncategory Lee described and illustrated.

App., July 17, 2006) (delay of two\nyears and six months barred claim).\n   Martin nevertheless urges that California’s rule is too\nvague to be regarded as “firmly established.” “[R]eason\nable time” period and “substantial delay,” he maintains,\nare “meaningless terms.” Brief for Respondent 48 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). We disagree. Indetermi\nnate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica\ntion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,\ncan supply the requisite clarity.\n   Congressional statutes and this Court’s decisions, we\nnote, have employed time limitations that are not stated\nin precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas\nCorpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on\nsubmission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis\nmissal of a state prisoner’s petition when it appeared that\ndelay in commencing litigation “prejudiced [the State] in\nits ability to respond.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 9(a) (1994\ned.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show\nthat he could not earlier have known, “by the exercise of\nreasonable diligence,” the grounds on which he based the\npetition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269 (2005),\nwe instructed district courts, when employing stay and\nabeyance procedure, see supra, at 5, n. 3, to “place reason\n——————\nauthority that had such a grossly misleading profile of the petitioner\nbefore it that, absent the trial error or omission, no reasonable judge or\njury would have imposed a sentence of death; or (iv) that the petitioner\nwas convicted or sentenced under an invalid statute.” In re Robbins, 18\nCal. 4th 770, 780–781, 959 P. 2d 311, 318 (1998).\n10                      WALKER v.

S. 295, 309, n. 7\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). But “use of an\nimprecise standard,” we immediately added, “is no justifi\ncation for depriving [a rule’s] language of any meaning.”\nIbid. “[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard\nstate procedural rules that are substantially similar to\nthose to which we give full force in our own courts.” Kind-\nler, 558 U.

In rea\nsoned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke\nClark, Robbins, and Gallego to determine whether a ha\nbeas petition is time barred.6\n   Martin argued below that California’s time bar is not\nregularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials\n——————\n  6 See, e.g., In re Sanders, 21 Cal. 4th 697, 703, 981 P. 2d 1038, 1042\n\n(1999); In re Hamilton, 20 Cal. 4th 273, 283, n. 5, 975 P. 2d 600, 605,\nn. 5 (1999); In re Watson, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 403, 407 (App. 2010) (offi\ncially depublished); In re Nunez, 173 Cal. App. 4th 709, 723, 93 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 242, 252 (2009).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes it “impossible to tell” why the California Supreme\nCourt “decides some delayed petitions on the merits and\nrejects others as untimely.” Brief for Appellant in No. 08–\n15752 (CA9), pp. 37–38. We see no reason to reject Cali\nfornia’s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass\nthe Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a\npetition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, e.g.,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984) (“[A]\ncourt need not determine whether counsel’s performance\nwas deficient . . . [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffec\ntiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice\n. . . .”); cf. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574,\n585 (1999) (“It is hardly novel for a federal court to choose\namong threshold grounds for denying audience to a case\non the merits.”).\n    The Ninth Circuit concluded that California’s time bar\nis not consistently applied because outcomes under the\nrule vary from case to case. See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794.\nFor example, in People v. Fairbanks, No. C047810, 2006\nWL 950267, *2–*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year\ndelay was found substantial, while in In re Little, No.\nD047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n. 6 (Cal. App., Jan. 16,\n2008), a delay of 14 months was determined to be\ninsubstantial.\n    A discretionary rule ought not be disregarded automati\ncally upon a showing of seeming inconsistencies.7 Discre\n——————\n  7 Closerinspection may reveal that “seeming ‘inconsistencie[s]’ . . . are\nnot necessarily . . . arbitrar[y] or irrationa[l].” Thornburgh v. Abbott,\n490 U. S. 401, 417, n. 15 (1989). Fairbanks and Little are illustrative.\nIn Fairbanks, the court found that petitioner did not act diligently\nwhen she waited to withdraw her guilty plea until one year after\nlearning that revocation of her driver’s license was irreversible. 2006\nWL 950267, *2–*3. In Little, a pro se prisoner claimed that his trial\ncounsel should have raised a posttraumatic stress disorder defense.\nAlthough the filing delay was 14 months, the court entertained it on\nthe merits. 2008 WL 142832, *4, *14. Given the discrete context in\nwhich each case arose, the two decisions present no square conflict.\n12                        WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion enables a court to home in on case-specific considera\ntions and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes\nattend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See\nPrihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)\n(“Uncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state’s\nprocedural ground as one ‘adequate’ under federal law. If\nit were, states would be induced to make their rules\ndraconian . . . .”).\n   A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate\nwhen “discretion has been exercised to impose novel and\nunforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial\nsupport in prior state law . . . .” 16B C. Wright, A. Miller,\n& E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §4026, p. 386\n(2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright & Miller); see Prihoda,\n910 F. 2d, at 1383 (state ground “applied infrequently,\nunexpectedly, or freakishly” may “discriminat[e] against\nthe federal rights asserted” and therefore rank as “inade\nquate”). Martin does not contend, however, that in his\ncase, the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion\nin a surprising or unfair manner.\n   “[S]ound procedure often requires discretion to exact or\nexcuse compliance with strict rules,” 16B Wright & Miller\n§4028, p. 403, and we have no cause to discourage stan\ndards allowing courts to exercise such discretion. As this\nCourt observed in Kindler, if forced to choose between\nmandatory rules certain to be found “adequate,” or more\nsupple prescriptions that federal courts may disregard as\n“inadequate,” “many States [might] opt for mandatory\nrules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary fed\neral review.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). “Th[at]\nresult would be particularly unfortunate for [habeas peti\ntioners], who would lose the opportunity to argue that a\nprocedural default should be excused through the exercise\nof judicial discretion.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).8\n——————\n 8 See   also 16B Wright & Miller §4026, pp. 385–386 (“Precisely defined\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

See Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala., 338\nU. S. 294, 298–299 (1949); Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22,\n24–25 (1923); 16B Wright & Miller §4026, p. 386 (noting\n“risk that discretionary procedural sanctions may be\ninvoked more harshly against disfavored federal rights,\n. . . deny[ing] [litigants] a fair opportunity to present\nfederal claims”). See also Kindler, 558 U. S., at ___\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (a state proce\ndural ground would be inadequate if the challenger shows\na “purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees”).\nOn the record before us, however, there is no basis for\nconcluding that California’s timeliness rule operates to the\nparticular disadvantage of petitioners asserting federal\nrights.\n                         *    *    *\n  For the reasons stated, we find no inadequacy in Cali\nfornia’s timeliness rule generally or as applied in Martin’s\ncase.
