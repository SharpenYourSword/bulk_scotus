MARTIN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 09\u2013996.       Argued November 29, 2010\u2014Decided February 23, 2011\nWhile most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief appli\n cations, California courts \u201cappl[y] a general \u2018reasonableness\u2019 stan\n dard\u201d to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed, Carey v. Saf\n fold, 536 U. S. 214, 222. Under that standard, \u201ca [habeas] petition\n should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow . . . ,\u201d In re\n Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729, 738, n. 5. Three deci\n sions, Clark, In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P. 2d 311, and In re\n Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290, describe California\u2019s timeli\n ness requirement. A prisoner must seek habeas relief without \u201csub\n stantial delay,\u201d e.g., Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 3d, at 317, as\n \u201cmeasured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasona\n bly should have known, of the information offered in support of the\n claim and the legal basis of the claim,\u201d id., at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n All California courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\n ceedings.\u201d Cal. Const., Art. VI, \u00a710. Because a habeas petitioner\n may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Su\n preme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas peti\n tions each year. A summary denial citing Clark and Robbins means\n that the petition is rejected as untimely. California courts, however,\n have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily\n reject the petition for want of merit.\n    Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was\n sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su\n preme Court denied Martin\u2019s first state habeas petition, he filed a\n federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit\n Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of\n counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those\n claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,\n2                          WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until\n    nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. The\n    California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Rob\n    bins. Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an\n    amended federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed his\n    belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law. The\n    Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to\n    determine the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the State\u2019s time bar. Again rejecting\n    Martin\u2019s petition, the District Court found California\u2019s bar an ade\n    quate state ground for denying Martin\u2019s new pleas. Concluding that\n    the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth\n    Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin\u2019s\n    claims.\nHeld: California\u2019s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent\n state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.\n Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (a) Absent showings of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d see Wainwright v.\n Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84\u201385, federal habeas relief will be unavailable\n when (1) \u201ca state court [has] declined to address a prisoner\u2019s federal\n claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural re\n quirement,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state judgment rests on independent and\n adequate state procedural grounds,\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n 722, 729\u2013730. P. 7.\n    (b) A \u201crule can be \u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed,\u2019 \u201d and\n therefore adequate, \u201ceven if the appropriate exercise of discretion\n may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\n others.\u201d Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___. California\u2019s time rule,\n although discretionary, meets this \u201cfirmly established\u201d criterion. The\n California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of\n cases, instructing habeas petitioners to \u201calleg[e] with specificity\u201d the\n absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for\n one of four exceptions to the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838,\n 959 P. 2d, at 299. And California\u2019s case law made it plain that Mar\n tin\u2019s nearly five-year delay was \u201csubstantial.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 829\u2013\n 831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P. 2d, at 293\u2013294, 299, and n. 13. The Court\n finds unpersuasive Martin\u2019s argument that the terms \u201creasonable\n time\u201d period and \u201csubstantial delay\u201d make California\u2019s rule too vague\n to be regarded as \u201cfirmly established.\u201d While indeterminate language\n is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particu\n lar circumstances can supply the requisite clarity. Congressional\n statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions have employed time limitations\n that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. For example, current\n federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one\n year. The clock runs from \u201cthe date on which the [supporting] facts\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  . . . could have been discovered through . . . due diligence.\u201d 28\n  U. S. C. \u00a72255(f)(4). Although \u201c \u2018due diligence\u2019 is an inexact measure\n  of how much delay is too much,\u201d Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.\n  295, 309, n. 7, \u201cuse of an imprecise standard is no justification for de\n  priving [a rule\u2019s] language of any meaning,\u201d ibid. Nor is California\u2019s\n  time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.\n  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies\n  hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary\n  to Martin\u2019s argument, California\u2019s time bar is not infirm simply be\n  cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and\n  summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.\n  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a\n  showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre\n  tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to\n  avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an\n  unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a\n  court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,\n  but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7\u201312.\n      (c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court\u2019s repeated recognition\n  that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require\n  ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against\n  claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,\n  338 U. S. 294, 298\u2013299. On the record here, however, there is no ba\n  sis for concluding that California\u2019s rule operates in such a discrimina\n  tory manner. P. 13.\n357 Fed.

CHARLES W. MARTIN\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 23, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns California\u2019s time limitation on appli\ncations for postconviction (habeas corpus) relief. The\nquestion presented: Does California\u2019s timeliness require\nment qualify as an independent state ground adequate to\nbar habeas corpus relief in federal court?\n   California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to\ndetermine the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s petition for\nhabeas corpus. Instead, California directs petitioners to\nfile known claims \u201cas promptly as the circumstances al\nlow.\u201d In re Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d 729,\n738, n. 5 (1993). Petitioners are further instructed to state\nwhen they first learned of the asserted claims and to\nexplain why they did not seek postconviction relief sooner.\nIn re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780, 959 P. 2d 311, 317\u2013\n318 (1998). Claims substantially delayed without justifi\ncation may be denied as untimely. Ibid.; Clark, 5 Cal. 4th,\nat 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at 738, n. 5.\n   California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied\nas untimely by citing the controlling decisions, i.e., Clark\nand Robbins. A spare order denying a petition without\n2                   WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on\nthe merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see Harrington v. Richter,\nante, at 9\u201310. California courts may elect to pretermit the\nquestion whether a petition is timely and simply deny the\npetition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.\n   Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin,\npresented the claims at issue\u2014all alleging ineffective\nassistance of counsel\u2014in a habeas petition filed in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court nearly five years after his con\nviction became final. He stated no reason for the long\ndelay. Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Mar\ntin\u2019s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the\nEastern District of California dismissed Martin\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance\nclaims. Denial of Martin\u2019s state-court petition as un\ntimely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground, i.e., Martin\u2019s failure to seek\nrelief in state court \u201cwithout substantial delay.\u201d See\nRobbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re\nversed the District Court\u2019s decision. Contrasting the\nprecision of \u201cfixed statutory deadlines\u201d with California\u2019s\nproscription of \u201csubstantial delay,\u201d the appeals court held\nthat California\u2019s standard lacked the clarity and certainty\nnecessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 357 Fed.\nAppx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on Townsend v. Knowles,\n562 F. 3d 1200 (CA9 2009)).\n   In a recent decision, Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009), this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may\ncount as an adequate and independent ground for denying\na federal habeas petition even if the state court had dis\ncretion to reach the merits despite the default. Guided by\nthat decision, we hold that California is not put to the\nchoice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions\n(which would almost certainly rule out Martin\u2019s nearly\nfive-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

In so\nruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that Califor\nnia\u2019s time bar, either by design or in operation, discrimi\nnates against federal claims or claimants.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   While most States set determinate time limits for collat\neral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor\nrule of court does so. Instead, California courts \u201cappl[y] a\ngeneral \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard\u201d to judge whether a\nhabeas petition is timely filed. Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S.\n214, 222 (2002). The basic instruction provided by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is simply that \u201ca [habeas] peti\ntion should be filed as promptly as the circumstances\nallow . . . .\u201d Clark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P. 2d, at\n738, n. 5.\n   Three leading decisions describe California\u2019s timeliness\nrequirement: Robbins, Clark, and In re Gallego, 18 Cal.\n4th 825, 959 P. 2d 290 (1998).

MARTIN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   California\u2019s collateral review regime differs from that of\nother States in a second notable respect: All California\ncourts \u201chave original jurisdiction in habeas corpus pro\nceedings,\u201d Cal. Const., Art. VI, \u00a710, thus \u201cno appeal lies\nfrom the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d\nClark, 5 Cal. 4th, at 767, n. 7, 855 P. 2d, at 740, n. 7. \u201c[A]\nprisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior\ncourt can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a\nnew petition in the Court of Appeal.\u201d Ibid. The new\npetition, however, must be confined to claims raised in the\ninitial petition. See In re Martinez, 46 Cal. 4th 945, 956,\n209 P. 3d 908, 915 (2009).\n   Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower\ncourts and file directly in the California Supreme Court,\nIn re Kler, 188 Cal. App. 4th 1399, 1403, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n889, 891\u2013892 (2010), that court rules on a staggering\nnumber of habeas petitions each year.2 The court issues\ngenerally unelaborated \u201csummary denials\u201d of petitions\nthat \u201cd[o] not state a prima facie case for relief\u201d or that\ncontain \u201cclaims [that] are all procedurally barred.\u201d People\nv. Romero, 8 Cal. 4th 728, 737, 883 P. 2d 388, 391 (1994)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A summary denial\nciting Clark and Robbins means that the petition is re\njected as untimely.

Martin fled the State,\nbut eight years later he was extradited to California to\nstand trial. Convicted in state court of murder and rob\nbery, Martin was sentenced to life in prison without the\npossibility of parole. In 1997, the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied review.\n   Martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceed\nings in 1998, and the next year, the California Supreme\nCourt denied his petition. He then filed a habeas petition\nin the appropriate U. S. District Court. Finding that\nMartin\u2019s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claims he had not aired in state court, the District\nCourt stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin\u2019s\nreturn to state court to exhaust his remedies there.3\n   In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition\nin the California Supreme Court, raising the federal in\neffective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted. He\ngave no reason for his failure to assert the additional\nclaims until nearly five years after his sentence and con\nviction became final. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 39. In Septem\nber 2002, the California Supreme Court denied Martin\u2019s\npetition in an order typical of that court\u2019s summary dispo\nsitions for failure to file \u201cas promptly as the circumstances\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Rather than dismiss a petition containing both exhausted and un\n\nexhausted claims, \u201ca district court might stay the petition and hold it in\nabeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his\npreviously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner exhausts his state\nremedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to\nproceed in federal court.\u201d Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.

Id., at 27,\n57. The Ninth Circuit vacated the dismissal order and\nremanded the case, directing the District Court to deter\nmine the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the State\u2019s time bar. Martin v.\nHubbard, 192 Fed. Appx. 616, 618 (2006). The District\nCourt again rejected Martin\u2019s petition, stating that \u201c[t]he\nCalifornia timeliness bar as set forth in . . . Clark/Robbins\nis clearly defined, well established and consistently ap\nplied.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 4.\n  The Ninth Circuit again disagreed. Controlled by its\nprior decision in Townsend, 562 F. 3d, at 1207\u20131208, the\nCourt of Appeals held that California\u2019s time bar \u201chas yet\nto be firmly defined\u201d and was not shown by the State to be\n\u201cconsistently applied.\u201d 357 Fed. Appx., at 794. The re\nmand order directed the District Court to determine the\nmerits of the claims Martin asserted in his second petition\nto the California Supreme Court.\n  We granted certiorari, 561 U.

The state-law\nground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case,\nor a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the\nmerits. See Sykes, 433 U. S., at 81\u201382, 90.\n   Ordinarily, a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief\nmust first \u201cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts\nof the State,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A), thereby affording\nthose courts \u201cthe first opportunity to address and correct\nalleged violations of [the] prisoner\u2019s federal rights,\u201d Cole\nman, 501 U. S., at 731. The adequate and independent\nstate ground doctrine furthers that objective, for without\nit, \u201chabeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaus\ntion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in\nstate court.\u201d Id., at 732. Accordingly, absent showings of\n\u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d see Sykes, 433 U.

A \u201crule can be \u2018firmly\nestablished\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed,\u2019 \u201d Kindler observed,\n\u201ceven if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit\nconsideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\nothers.\u201d Ibid.\n   California\u2019s time rule, although discretionary, meets the\n\u201cfirmly established\u201d criterion, as Kindler comprehended\nthat requirement. The California Supreme Court, as\nearlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for ha\nbeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See supra, at 3.\nThose decisions instruct habeas petitioners to \u201calleg[e]\nwith specificity\u201d the absence of substantial delay, good\ncause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to\nthe time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P. 2d, at\n299; see Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 Wehave also recognized a \u201climited category\u201d of \u201cexceptional cases in\nwhich exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state\nground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d Lee v.\nKemna, 534 U. S. 362, 376 (2002). In Lee, for example, the defendant\nunsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to\nhim, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled\nto testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state\ncourt\u2019s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements\nfor continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied\nwith the rule\u2019s key requirement and flawless compliance would have\nbeen unavailing given the trial court\u2019s reason for denying the motion.\nSee id., at 381\u2013382. Martin does not suggest that the application of\nCalifornia\u2019s timeliness rule in his case falls within the exceptional\ncategory Lee described and illustrated. See Brief for Respondent 28, 29,\n54.\n   5 An untimely petition \u201cwill be entertained on the merits if the peti\n\ntioner demonstrates (i) that error of constitutional magnitude led to a\ntrial that was so fundamentally unfair that absent the error no reason\nable judge or jury would have convicted the petitioner; (ii) that the\npetitioner is actually innocent of the crime or crimes of which he or she\nwas convicted; (iii) that the death penalty was imposed by a sentencing\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

App., July 17, 2006) (delay of two\nyears and six months barred claim).\n   Martin nevertheless urges that California\u2019s rule is too\nvague to be regarded as \u201cfirmly established.\u201d \u201c[R]eason\nable time\u201d period and \u201csubstantial delay,\u201d he maintains,\nare \u201cmeaningless terms.\u201d Brief for Respondent 48 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). We disagree. Indetermi\nnate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica\ntion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,\ncan supply the requisite clarity.\n   Congressional statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions, we\nnote, have employed time limitations that are not stated\nin precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas\nCorpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on\nsubmission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis\nmissal of a state prisoner\u2019s petition when it appeared that\ndelay in commencing litigation \u201cprejudiced [the State] in\nits ability to respond.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 Rule 9(a) (1994\ned.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show\nthat he could not earlier have known, \u201cby the exercise of\nreasonable diligence,\u201d the grounds on which he based the\npetition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269 (2005),\nwe instructed district courts, when employing stay and\nabeyance procedure, see supra, at 5, n. 3, to \u201cplace reason\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nauthority that had such a grossly misleading profile of the petitioner\nbefore it that, absent the trial error or omission, no reasonable judge or\njury would have imposed a sentence of death; or (iv) that the petitioner\nwas convicted or sentenced under an invalid statute.\u201d In re Robbins, 18\nCal. 4th 770, 780\u2013781, 959 P. 2d 311, 318 (1998).\n10                      WALKER v.

But \u201cuse of an\nimprecise standard,\u201d we immediately added, \u201cis no justifi\ncation for depriving [a rule\u2019s] language of any meaning.\u201d\nIbid. \u201c[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard\nstate procedural rules that are substantially similar to\nthose to which we give full force in our own courts.\u201d Kind-\nler, 558 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8).\n   Nor is California\u2019s time rule vulnerable on the ground\nthat it is not regularly followed. Each year, the California\nSupreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas\npetitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Brief for Appellant\nin No. 08\u201315752 (CA9), pp. 31\u201332. On the same day the\ncourt denied Martin\u2019s petition, it issued 21 other\nClark/Robbins summary denials. See Brief for Habeas\nCorpus Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20. In rea\nsoned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke\nClark, Robbins, and Gallego to determine whether a ha\nbeas petition is time barred.6\n   Martin argued below that California\u2019s time bar is not\nregularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See, e.g., In re Sanders, 21 Cal. 4th 697, 703, 981 P. 2d 1038, 1042\n\n(1999); In re Hamilton, 20 Cal. 4th 273, 283, n. 5, 975 P. 2d 600, 605,\nn. 5 (1999); In re Watson, 104 Cal.

We see no reason to reject Cali\nfornia\u2019s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass\nthe Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a\npetition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, e.g.,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984) (\u201c[A]\ncourt need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance\nwas deficient . . . [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffec\ntiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice\n. . . .\u201d); cf. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574,\n585 (1999) (\u201cIt is hardly novel for a federal court to choose\namong threshold grounds for denying audience to a case\non the merits.\u201d).\n    The Ninth Circuit concluded that California\u2019s time bar\nis not consistently applied because outcomes under the\nrule vary from case to case. See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794.\nFor example, in People v. Fairbanks, No. C047810, 2006\nWL 950267, *2\u2013*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year\ndelay was found substantial, while in In re Little, No.\nD047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n. 6 (Cal. App., Jan. 16,\n2008), a delay of 14 months was determined to be\ninsubstantial.\n    A discretionary rule ought not be disregarded automati\ncally upon a showing of seeming inconsistencies.7 Discre\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Closerinspection may reveal that \u201cseeming \u2018inconsistencie[s]\u2019 . . . are\nnot necessarily . . . arbitrar[y] or irrationa[l].\u201d Thornburgh v. Abbott,\n490 U. S. 401, 417, n. 15 (1989). Fairbanks and Little are illustrative.\nIn Fairbanks, the court found that petitioner did not act diligently\nwhen she waited to withdraw her guilty plea until one year after\nlearning that revocation of her driver\u2019s license was irreversible. 2006\nWL 950267, *2\u2013*3. In Little, a pro se prisoner claimed that his trial\ncounsel should have raised a posttraumatic stress disorder defense.\nAlthough the filing delay was 14 months, the court entertained it on\nthe merits. 2008 WL 142832, *4, *14. Given the discrete context in\nwhich each case arose, the two decisions present no square conflict.\n12                        WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion enables a court to home in on case-specific considera\ntions and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes\nattend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See\nPrihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)\n(\u201cUncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state\u2019s\nprocedural ground as one \u2018adequate\u2019 under federal law.

California courts, however,\n have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily\n reject the petition for want of merit.\n    Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was\n sentenced to life in prison without parole. After the California Su\n preme Court denied Martin\u2019s first state habeas petition, he filed a\n federal habeas petition. The District Court ordered a stay to permit\n Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of\n counsel claims he had not previously aired. Martin raised those\n claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court,\n2                          WALKER v. MARTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until\n    nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. The\n    California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing Clark and Rob\n    bins. Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an\n    amended federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed his\n    belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law. The\n    Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to\n    determine the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the State\u2019s time bar. Again rejecting\n    Martin\u2019s petition, the District Court found California\u2019s bar an ade\n    quate state ground for denying Martin\u2019s new pleas. Concluding that\n    the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth\n    Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin\u2019s\n    claims.\nHeld: California\u2019s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent\n state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.\n Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (a) Absent showings of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d see Wainwright v.\n Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84\u201385, federal habeas relief will be unavailable\n when (1) \u201ca state court [has] declined to address a prisoner\u2019s federal\n claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural re\n quirement,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state judgment rests on independent and\n adequate state procedural grounds,\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n 722, 729\u2013730. P. 7.\n    (b) A \u201crule can be \u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed,\u2019 \u201d and\n therefore adequate, \u201ceven if the appropriate exercise of discretion\n may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\n others.\u201d Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___. California\u2019s time rule,\n although discretionary, meets this \u201cfirmly established\u201d criterion. The\n California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of\n cases, instructing habeas petitioners to \u201calleg[e] with specificity\u201d the\n absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for\n one of four exceptions to the time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838,\n 959 P. 2d, at 299. And California\u2019s case law made it plain that Mar\n tin\u2019s nearly five-year delay was \u201csubstantial.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 829\u2013\n 831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P. 2d, at 293\u2013294, 299, and n. 13. The Court\n finds unpersuasive Martin\u2019s argument that the terms \u201creasonable\n time\u201d period and \u201csubstantial delay\u201d make California\u2019s rule too vague\n to be regarded as \u201cfirmly established.\u201d While indeterminate language\n is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particu\n lar circumstances can supply the requisite clarity. Congressional\n statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions have employed time limitations\n that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. For example, current\n federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one\n year. The clock runs from \u201cthe date on which the [supporting] facts\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Although \u201c \u2018due diligence\u2019 is an inexact measure\n  of how much delay is too much,\u201d Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S.\n  295, 309, n. 7, \u201cuse of an imprecise standard is no justification for de\n  priving [a rule\u2019s] language of any meaning,\u201d ibid. Nor is California\u2019s\n  time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.\n  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies\n  hundreds of habeas petitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Contrary\n  to Martin\u2019s argument, California\u2019s time bar is not infirm simply be\n  cause a court may opt to bypass the Clark/Robbins assessment and\n  summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.\n  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a\n  showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. Discre\n  tion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to\n  avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an\n  unyielding rule. A state ground may be found inadequate when a\n  court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,\n  but Martin makes no such contention here. Pp. 7\u201312.\n      (c) This decision leaves unaltered the Court\u2019s repeated recognition\n  that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural require\n  ments to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against\n  claims of federal rights. See, e.g., Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala.,\n  338 U. S. 294, 298\u2013299. On the record here, however, there is no ba\n  sis for concluding that California\u2019s rule operates in such a discrimina\n  tory manner. P. 13.\n357 Fed.

California courts may elect to pretermit the\nquestion whether a petition is timely and simply deny the\npetition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.\n   Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin,\npresented the claims at issue\u2014all alleging ineffective\nassistance of counsel\u2014in a habeas petition filed in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court nearly five years after his con\nviction became final. He stated no reason for the long\ndelay. Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Mar\ntin\u2019s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the\nEastern District of California dismissed Martin\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance\nclaims. Denial of Martin\u2019s state-court petition as un\ntimely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground, i.e., Martin\u2019s failure to seek\nrelief in state court \u201cwithout substantial delay.\u201d See\nRobbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P. 2d, at 322.\n   The U.

A \u201crule can be \u2018firmly\nestablished\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed,\u2019 \u201d Kindler observed,\n\u201ceven if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit\nconsideration of a federal claim in some cases but not\nothers.\u201d Ibid.\n   California\u2019s time rule, although discretionary, meets the\n\u201cfirmly established\u201d criterion, as Kindler comprehended\nthat requirement. The California Supreme Court, as\nearlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for ha\nbeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See supra, at 3.\nThose decisions instruct habeas petitioners to \u201calleg[e]\nwith specificity\u201d the absence of substantial delay, good\ncause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to\nthe time bar. Gallego, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P. 2d, at\n299; see Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P. 2d, at 317.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 Wehave also recognized a \u201climited category\u201d of \u201cexceptional cases in\nwhich exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state\nground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d Lee v.\nKemna, 534 U. S. 362, 376 (2002). In Lee, for example, the defendant\nunsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to\nhim, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled\nto testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state\ncourt\u2019s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements\nfor continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied\nwith the rule\u2019s key requirement and flawless compliance would have\nbeen unavailing given the trial court\u2019s reason for denying the motion.\nSee id., at 381\u2013382. Martin does not suggest that the application of\nCalifornia\u2019s timeliness rule in his case falls within the exceptional\ncategory Lee described and illustrated. See Brief for Respondent 28, 29,\n54.\n   5 An untimely petition \u201cwill be entertained on the merits if the peti\n\ntioner demonstrates (i) that error of constitutional magnitude led to a\ntrial that was so fundamentally unfair that absent the error no reason\nable judge or jury would have convicted the petitioner; (ii) that the\npetitioner is actually innocent of the crime or crimes of which he or she\nwas convicted; (iii) that the death penalty was imposed by a sentencing\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

We disagree. Indetermi\nnate language is typical of discretionary rules. Applica\ntion of those rules in particular circumstances, however,\ncan supply the requisite clarity.\n   Congressional statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions, we\nnote, have employed time limitations that are not stated\nin precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas\nCorpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on\nsubmission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dis\nmissal of a state prisoner\u2019s petition when it appeared that\ndelay in commencing litigation \u201cprejudiced [the State] in\nits ability to respond.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 Rule 9(a) (1994\ned.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show\nthat he could not earlier have known, \u201cby the exercise of\nreasonable diligence,\u201d the grounds on which he based the\npetition. Ibid. In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.

S., at __ (slip op., at 8).\n   Nor is California\u2019s time rule vulnerable on the ground\nthat it is not regularly followed. Each year, the California\nSupreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas\npetitions by citing Clark and Robbins. Brief for Appellant\nin No. 08\u201315752 (CA9), pp. 31\u201332. On the same day the\ncourt denied Martin\u2019s petition, it issued 21 other\nClark/Robbins summary denials. See Brief for Habeas\nCorpus Resource Center as Amicus Curiae 20. In rea\nsoned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke\nClark, Robbins, and Gallego to determine whether a ha\nbeas petition is time barred.6\n   Martin argued below that California\u2019s time bar is not\nregularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See, e.g., In re Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160943\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160943/in-re-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703, 981 P. 2d 1038, 1042\n\n(1999); In re Hamilton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1199597\"><a href=\"/opinion/1199597/in-re-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283, n. 5, 975 P. 2d 600, 605,\nn. 5 (1999); In re Watson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256017/in-re-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We see no reason to reject Cali\nfornia\u2019s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass\nthe Clark/Robbins assessment and summarily dismiss a\npetition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, e.g.,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984) (\u201c[A]\ncourt need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance\nwas deficient . . .

MARTIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion enables a court to home in on case-specific considera\ntions and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes\nattend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See\nPrihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990)\n(\u201cUncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state\u2019s\nprocedural ground as one \u2018adequate\u2019 under federal law.
