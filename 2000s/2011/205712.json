SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF \n\n              VETERANS AFFAIRS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u20131036. Argued December 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for\n  adjudicating veterans\u2019 benefits claims for service-connected disabili\n  ties: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and\n  a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review\n  in the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. Before 1988, a veteran whose\n  claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further re\n  view, but the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court\n  of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribu\n  nal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans. A veteran must\n  file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date\n  when the Board\u2019s final decision is properly mailed. 38 U. S. C.\n  \u00a77266(a).\n     After the VA denied David Henderson\u2019s claim for supplemental\n  disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court,\n  missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days. Henderson argued\n  that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable toll\n  ing principles. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided\n  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, which held that the statutory limita\n  tion on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in\n  an ordinary civil case is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d so that a party\u2019s failure to\n  file within that period could not be excused. The Veterans Court con\n  cluded that Bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day\n  deadline and dismissed Henderson\u2019s untimely appeal. The Federal\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court\n2                       HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    does not have jurisdictional consequences. Pp. 4\u201313.\n       (a) Branding a procedural rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter\n    jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.\n    Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do\n    not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus\n    must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either\n    overlook or elect not to press. Jurisdictional rules may also cause a\n    waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since\n    objections may be raised at any time, even after trial. Because of\n    these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should\n    not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudi\n    catory capacity, i.e., its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. E.g.,\n    Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Among the rules\n    that should not be described as jurisdictional are \u201cclaim-processing\n    rules,\u201d which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by re\n    quiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.\n    Although filing deadlines are quintessential claim-processing rules,\n    Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.\n    Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, applied a \u201creadily adminis\n    trable bright line\u201d rule to determine whether Congress has done so:\n    There must be a \u201cclear\u201d indication that Congress wanted the rule to\n    be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Id., at 515\u2013516. \u201c[C]ontext, including this Court\u2019s\n    interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant,\u201d\n    Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___, to whether Congress has spoken clearly\n    on this point. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline\n    here be jurisdictional. Pp. 7\u201312.\n         (1) None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here. All\n    of the cases they cite\u2014e.g., Bowles, supra; Stone v. INS, 514 U. S.\n    386; and Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467\u2014involved review\n    by Article III courts. This case, by contrast, involves review by an\n    Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme. Instead\n    of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative de\n    cisions, this Court attempts to ascertain Congress\u2019 intent regarding\n    the particular type of review at issue. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant\n    to be jurisdictional. The terms of \u00a77266(a), which sets the deadline,\n    provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry ju\n    risdictional consequences. It neither speaks in \u201cjurisdictional terms\u201d\n    nor refers \u201cin any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],\u201d\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394. Nor does\n    \u00a77266\u2019s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication. Its\n    placement in a subchapter entitled \u201cProcedure,\u201d and not in the sub\n    chapter entitled \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction,\u201d suggests that Con\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  gress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule. Most\n  telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review\n  scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans\u2019 benefits\n  claims. Congress\u2019 longstanding solicitude for veterans, United States\n  v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in\n  subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s fa\n  vor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA deci\n  sions. The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\u2014which provided\n  the context in Bowles\u2014and the system Congress created for veterans\n  is dramatic. In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be com\n  menced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adver\n  sarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims\n  and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both\n  parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be\n  reopened only in narrow circumstances. By contrast, a veteran need\n  not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA pro\n  ceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veter\n  ans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the\n  benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence. A veteran who loses\n  before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a\n  Board decision in the veteran\u2019s favor is final. And a veteran may re\n  open a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid\n  jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply\n  with this scheme. Particularly in light of \u201cthe canon that provisions\n  for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in\n  the beneficiaries\u2019 favor,\u201d King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,\n  220\u2013221, n. 9, this Court sees no clear indication that the 120-day\n  limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany\n  the jurisdiction tag. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, the\n  lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help\n  in interpreting \u00a77266(a). Section 7266(a) was enacted as part of the\n  VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.\n  Pp. 8\u201312.\n589 F. 3d 1201, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Mem\nbers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of the case.\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

SHINSEKI, SECRE-\n\n           TARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 1, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   A veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by\nthe Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals may appeal to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans\nCourt). To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal\nwith the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date\nwhen the Board\u2019s final decision is properly mailed. 38\nU. S. C. \u00a77266(a). This case presents the question wheth\ner a veteran\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal within the\n120-day period should be regarded as having \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d consequences. We hold that it should not.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers\nthe federal program that provides benefits to veterans\nwith service-connected disabilities. The VA has a two-step\nprocess for the adjudication of these claims. First, a VA\nregional office receives and processes veterans\u2019 claims and\nmakes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny\n2                   HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbenefits. Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the\nregional office\u2019s decision, the veteran may obtain de novo\nreview by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. The Board is a\nbody within the VA that makes the agency\u2019s final decision\nin cases appealed to it. \u00a7\u00a77101, 7104(a).\n   The VA\u2019s adjudicatory \u201cprocess is designed to function\nthroughout with a high degree of informality and solici\ntude for the claimant.\u201d Walters v. National Assn. of Ra\ndiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985). A veteran\nfaces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is\nfiled, the VA\u2019s process for adjudicating it at the regional\noffice and the Board is ex parte and nonadversarial, 38\nCFR \u00a7\u00a73.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010). The VA has a statutory\nduty to assist veterans in developing the evidence neces\nsary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75103(a)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III), 5103A (2006 ed.). And when evaluat\ning claims, the VA must give veterans the \u201cbenefit of\nthe doubt\u201d whenever positive and negative evidence on\na material issue is roughly equal. \u00a75107(b). If a regional\noffice denies a claim, the veteran has a generous one-year\ntime limit to initiate an appeal to the Board. \u00a77105(b)(1);\n38 CFR \u00a720.302(a). A veteran may also reopen a previ\nously denied claim at any time by presenting \u201cnew and\nmaterial evidence,\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a75108, and decisions by a\nregional office or the Board are subject to challenge at any\ntime based on \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d \u00a7\u00a75109A,\n7111.\n   Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was rejected by the\nVA was generally unable to obtain further review. 38\nU. S. C. \u00a7211(a) (1988 ed.).1 But the Veterans\u2019 Judicial\nReview Act (VJRA), 102 Stat. 4105 (codified, as amended,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 211(a) did not foreclose judicial review of constitutional\n\nchallenges to veterans\u2019 benefits legislation, Johnson v. Robison, 415\nU. S. 361, 366\u2013374 (1974), or of challenges to VA benefits regulations\nbased on later-in-time statutes that the VA did not administer exclu\nsively, Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U. S. 535, 541\u2013545 (1988).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin various sections of 38 U. S. C. (2006 ed. and Supp. III)),\ncreated the Veterans Court, an Article I tribunal, and\nauthorized that court to review Board decisions adverse to\nveterans.2 \u00a7\u00a77251, 7252(a) (2006 ed.). While proceedings\nbefore the Veterans Court are adversarial, see \u00a77263,\nveterans have a remarkable record of success before that\ntribunal. Statistics compiled by the Veterans Court show\nthat in the last decade, the court ordered some form of\nrelief in around 79 percent of its \u201cmerits decisions.\u201d3\n   Review of Veterans Court decisions on certain issues of\nlaw is available in the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit. \u00a77292. Federal Circuit decisions may\nin turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certiorari.\n                               B\n  David Henderson served in the military during the\nKorean War. In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100\npercent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and\nin 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based\non his need for in-home care. After a VA regional office\nand the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal\nwith the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing\ndeadline by 15 days. See \u00a77266(a).\n  The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson\u2019s\nappeal as untimely. It concluded that Henderson was not\nentitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had\nnot shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.\nLater, the court granted Henderson\u2019s motion for reconsid\neration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argu\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 When such an appeal is taken, the Veterans Court\u2019s scope of review,\n\n\u00a77261, is similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706.\n  3 See United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Annual\n\nReports 2000\u20132009, http://uscourts.cavc.gov/documents/Annual_Report_\nFY_2009_October_1_2008_to_September_30_2009.pdf (as visited Feb.\n25, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n4                 HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment. While Henderson\u2019s appeal was pending, however,\nwe decided Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). In\nBowles, we held that the statutory limitation on the length\nof an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an\nordinary civil case, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107(c) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIII), is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and we therefore held that a party\u2019s\nfailure to file a notice of appeal within that period could\nnot be excused based on equitable factors, or on the oppos\ning party\u2019s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late\nfiling. Bowles, supra, at 213\u2013214.\n   After we announced our decision in Bowles, the Veter\nans Court directed the parties to brief that decision\u2019s effect\non prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equi\ntable tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of\nappeal in the Veterans Court. A divided panel of the\nVeterans Court concluded that Bowles compelled jurisdic\ntional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed\nHenderson\u2019s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nHenderson v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 217 (2008).\n   Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a\ndivided en banc court affirmed. 589 F. 3d 1201 (2009).\nWe granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n   In this case, as in others that have come before us in\nrecent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is\n\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559\nU. S. ___ (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engi\nneers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central\nRegion, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); Bowles, supra; Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006); Eberhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam); Scarborough v.\nPrincipi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443 (2004). This question is not merely semantic but one\nof considerable practical importance for judges and liti\ngants. Branding a rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial\nsystem. Under that system, courts are generally limited\nto addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the\nparties. See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331,\n356\u2013357 (2006). Courts do not usually raise claims or\narguments on their own. But federal courts have an inde\npendent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the\nscope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise\nand decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either\noverlook or elect not to press. See Arbaugh, supra, at 514.\n   Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of\njudicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.\nFor purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is\nreplete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised\nat particular times. See Sanchez-Llamas, supra, at 356\u2013\n357. Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however,\nmay be raised at any time. Thus, a party, after losing at\ntrial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at\n508. Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if\nthe party had previously acknowledged the trial court\u2019s\njurisdiction. Ibid. And if the trial court lacked jurisdic\ntion, many months of work on the part of the attorneys\nand the court may be wasted.\n   Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdic\ntional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent\ncases to bring some discipline to the use of this term. We\nhave urged that a rule should not be referred to as juris\ndictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity,\nthat is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. Reed\nElsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); Kontrick, supra, at\n455. Other rules, even if important and mandatory, we\nhave said, should not be given the jurisdictional brand.\nSee Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   Among the types of rules that should not be described as\njurisdictional are what we have called \u201cclaim-processing\n6                 HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrules.\u201d These are rules that seek to promote the orderly\nprogress of litigation by requiring that the parties take\ncertain procedural steps at certain specified times. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14); Eberhart, supra, at 19; Scarborough,\nsupra, at 413\u2013414; Kontrick, supra, at 455\u2013456. Filing\ndeadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue\nhere, are quintessential claim-processing rules. Accord\ningly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of\njurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent\ncases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Cir\ncuit, and this opinion could end at this point.\n   Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that\nsimple because Congress is free to attach the conditions\nthat go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we\nwould prefer to call a claim-processing rule. See Bowles,\nsupra, at 212\u2013213. The question here, therefore, is\nwhether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be\n\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d In Arbaugh, we applied a \u201creadily admin\nistrable bright line\u201d rule for deciding such questions. 546\nU.

When \u201ca long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undis\nturbed by Congress,\u201d Union Pacific, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13), has treated a similar requirement as \u201cjurisdic\ntional,\u201d we will presume that Congress intended to follow\nthat course.

The Government reads Bowles to\nmean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in\ncivil cases are jurisdictional. Since \u00a77266(a) establishes a\nstatutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the\nGovernment reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.\n   We reject the major premise of this syllogism. Bowles\ndid not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking\njudicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional. Instead,\nBowles concerned an appeal from one court to another\ncourt. The \u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent and practice in\nAmerican courts\u201d on which Bowles relied involved appeals\nof that type. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and n. 2.\n   Contending that Bowles\u2019 reasoning extends to the judi\ncial review of administrative decisions, the Government\nrelies on Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386 (1995). There, with\nout elaboration, we described as \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdic\ntional\u2019 \u201d the deadline for seeking review in the courts of\nappeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigra\ntion Appeals. Id., at 405 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 495\nU. S. 33, 45 (1990)). The Government also notes that\nlower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs\nAct\u2019s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of\ncertain final agency decisions, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72344, is juris\ndictional. Brief for United States 18.\n   Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans\nCourt review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in\nmany respects from court of appeals review of an agency\n8                HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision under the Hobbs Act. Cf. Shinseki v. Sanders,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (\u201cCongress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency\u201d). And\nthere is force to petitioner\u2019s argument that a more ap\npropriate analog is judicial review of an administrative\ndecision denying Social Security disability benefits. The\nSocial Security disability benefits program, like the veter\nans benefits program, is \u201cunusually protective\u201d of claim\nants, Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106\u2013107 (1984). See\nalso Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 110\u2013112 (2000) (plurality\nopinion). Indeed, the Government acknowledges that \u201cthe\nSocial Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms\nshare significant common attributes.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 16. And long before Congress enacted the VJRA,\nwe held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social\nSecurity benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7405(g), is not jurisdictional. Bowen v. City of New York,\n476 U. S. 467, 478, and n. 10 (1986); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 328, n. 9 (1976); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422\nU. S. 749, 763\u2013764 (1975).\n   In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the\nparties controls our decision here. All of those cases in\nvolved review by Article III courts. This case, by contrast,\ninvolves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique\nadministrative scheme. Instead of applying a categorical\nrule regarding review of administrative decisions, we\nattempt to ascertain Congress\u2019 intent regarding the par\nticular type of review at issue in this case.\n                             B\n  Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for\nseeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have\njurisdictional attributes.\n  The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38\nU. S. C. \u00a77266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear\nevidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdic\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional consequences. Section 7266(a) provides:\n    \u201cIn order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals\n    for Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board\n    of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, a person adversely affected by\n    such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the\n    Court within 120 days after the date on which notice\n    of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of\n    this title.\u201d\n  This provision \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or\nrefer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans\nCourt],\u201d Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,\n394 (1982). If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to\nbe treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provi\nsion in language like that in the provision of the VJRA\nthat governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the\nVeterans Court. This latter provision states that Federal\nCircuit review must be obtained \u201cwithin the time and in\nthe manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts\nof appeals from United States district courts.\u201d \u00a77292(a).\nBecause the time for taking an appeal from a district court\nto a court of appeals in a civil case has long been under\nstood to be jurisdictional, see Bowles, supra, at 209\u2013210,\nand n. 2, this language clearly signals an intent to impose\nthe same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court\nto the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in\nthis case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true\nthat \u00a77266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have\nrejected the notion that \u201call mandatory prescriptions,\nhowever emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u201d\nUnion Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 510; internal quotation marks\nomitted). Thus, the language of \u00a77266 provides no clear\nindication that Congress wanted that provision to be\ntreated as having jurisdictional attributes.\n  Nor does \u00a77266\u2019s placement within the VJRA provide\n10                HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch an indication. Congress placed \u00a77266, numbered\n\u00a74066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled\n\u201cProcedure.\u201d See VJRA, \u00a7301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115\u20134116.\nThat placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day\nlimit as a claim-processing rule. Cf. INS v. National\nCenter for Immigrants\u2019 Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 189\n(1991) (\u201c[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolv\ning an ambiguity in the legislation\u2019s text\u201d). Congress\nelected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA sub\nchapter entitled \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction.\u201d See 102\nStat. 4113\u20134115.\n   Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned\n\u201cJurisdiction; finality of decisions,\u201d prescribes the jurisdic\ntion of the Veterans Court. Id., at 4113\u20134114. Subsection\n(a) of that provision, numbered \u00a74052 in the enacting\nlegislation, grants the Veterans Court \u201cexclusive jurisdic\ntion to review decisions of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals\u201d\nand the \u201cpower to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of\nthe Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.\u201d Id.,\nat 4113. It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals\nby the VA Secretary. Subsection (b) limits the court\u2019s\nreview to \u201cthe record of proceedings before the [VA],\u201d\nspecifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of\nthe VA\u2019s disability ratings schedule. Ibid. Nothing in this\nprovision or in the \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction\u201d sub\nchapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court\nreview.\n   While the terms and placement of \u00a77266 provide some\nindication of Congress\u2019 intent, what is most telling here\nare the singular characteristics of the review scheme that\nCongress created for the adjudication of veterans\u2019 benefits\nclaims. \u201cThe solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long\nstanding.\u201d United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647\n(1961); see also Sanders, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\nAnd that solicitude is plainly reflected in the VJRA, as\nwell as in subsequent laws that \u201cplace a thumb on the\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nscale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the course of administrative\nand judicial review of VA decisions,\u201d id., at ___ (Souter, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 2). See, e. g., Veterans Claims\nAssistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21,\n1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA, \u00a7103, 102 Stat. 4106\u20134107.\n   The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\u2014which\nprovided the context of our decision in Bowles\u2014and the\nsystem that Congress created for the adjudication of vet\nerans\u2019 benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic. In\nordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally com\nmence their suits within the time specified in a statute of\nlimitations, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658, and the litigation is\nadversarial. Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that\nsupports their claims and generally bear the burden of\nproduction and persuasion. Both parties may appeal an\nadverse trial-court decision, see \u00a71291, and a final judg\nment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.\n   By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an\ninitial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset\nof disability or separation from service. When a claim is\nfiled, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonad\nversarial. The VA is charged with the responsibility of\nassisting veterans in developing evidence that supports\ntheir claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must\ngive the veteran the benefit of any doubt. If a veteran is\nunsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may\nobtain de novo review before the Board, and if the veteran\nloses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further\nreview in the Veterans Court. A Board decision in the\nveteran\u2019s favor, on the other hand, is final. And even if a\nveteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of\nadministrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen\na claim simply by presenting \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d\nRigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash\n12                   HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsharply with this scheme.\n   We have long applied \u201cthe canon that provisions for\nbenefits to members of the Armed Services are to be con\nstrued in the beneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u201d King v.

S.\n275, 285 (1946). Particularly in light this canon, we do not\nfind any clear indication that the 120-day limit was in\ntended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany\nthe jurisdiction tag.\n   The Government argues that there is no reason to think\nthat jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent\nwith a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior\nto the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were\nnot subject to any further review at all. Brief for United\nStates 29. The provision at issue here, however, was\nenacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was\ndecidedly favorable to veterans.

Argued December 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for\n  adjudicating veterans\u2019 benefits claims for service-connected disabili\n  ties: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and\n  a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review\n  in the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. Before 1988, a veteran whose\n  claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further re\n  view, but the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court\n  of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribu\n  nal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans. A veteran must\n  file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date\n  when the Board\u2019s final decision is properly mailed. 38 U. S. C.\n  \u00a77266(a).\n     After the VA denied David Henderson\u2019s claim for supplemental\n  disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court,\n  missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days. Henderson argued\n  that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable toll\n  ing principles. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided\n  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, which held that the statutory limita\n  tion on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in\n  an ordinary civil case is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d so that a party\u2019s failure to\n  file within that period could not be excused. The Veterans Court con\n  cluded that Bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day\n  deadline and dismissed Henderson\u2019s untimely appeal. The Federal\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court\n2                       HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    does not have jurisdictional consequences. Pp. 4\u201313.\n       (a) Branding a procedural rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter\n    jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.\n    Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do\n    not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus\n    must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either\n    overlook or elect not to press. Jurisdictional rules may also cause a\n    waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since\n    objections may be raised at any time, even after trial. Because of\n    these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should\n    not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudi\n    catory capacity, i.e., its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. E.g.,\n    Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Among the rules\n    that should not be described as jurisdictional are \u201cclaim-processing\n    rules,\u201d which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by re\n    quiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.\n    Although filing deadlines are quintessential claim-processing rules,\n    Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.\n    Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, applied a \u201creadily adminis\n    trable bright line\u201d rule to determine whether Congress has done so:\n    There must be a \u201cclear\u201d indication that Congress wanted the rule to\n    be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Id., at 515\u2013516. \u201c[C]ontext, including this Court\u2019s\n    interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant,\u201d\n    Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___, to whether Congress has spoken clearly\n    on this point. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline\n    here be jurisdictional. Pp. 7\u201312.\n         (1) None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here. All\n    of the cases they cite\u2014e.g., Bowles, supra; Stone v. INS, 514 U. S.\n    386; and Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467\u2014involved review\n    by Article III courts. This case, by contrast, involves review by an\n    Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme. Instead\n    of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative de\n    cisions, this Court attempts to ascertain Congress\u2019 intent regarding\n    the particular type of review at issue. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant\n    to be jurisdictional. The terms of \u00a77266(a), which sets the deadline,\n    provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry ju\n    risdictional consequences. It neither speaks in \u201cjurisdictional terms\u201d\n    nor refers \u201cin any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],\u201d\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394. Nor does\n    \u00a77266\u2019s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication. Its\n    placement in a subchapter entitled \u201cProcedure,\u201d and not in the sub\n    chapter entitled \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction,\u201d suggests that Con\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  gress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule. Most\n  telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review\n  scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans\u2019 benefits\n  claims. Congress\u2019 longstanding solicitude for veterans, United States\n  v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in\n  subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s fa\n  vor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA deci\n  sions. The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\u2014which provided\n  the context in Bowles\u2014and the system Congress created for veterans\n  is dramatic. In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be com\n  menced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adver\n  sarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims\n  and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both\n  parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be\n  reopened only in narrow circumstances. By contrast, a veteran need\n  not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA pro\n  ceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veter\n  ans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the\n  benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence. A veteran who loses\n  before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a\n  Board decision in the veteran\u2019s favor is final. And a veteran may re\n  open a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid\n  jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply\n  with this scheme. Particularly in light of \u201cthe canon that provisions\n  for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in\n  the beneficiaries\u2019 favor,\u201d King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,\n  220\u2013221, n. 9, this Court sees no clear indication that the 120-day\n  limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany\n  the jurisdiction tag. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, the\n  lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help\n  in interpreting \u00a77266(a).

SHINSEKI, SECRE-\n\n           TARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 1, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   A veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by\nthe Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals may appeal to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans\nCourt). To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal\nwith the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date\nwhen the Board\u2019s final decision is properly mailed. 38\nU. S. C. \u00a77266(a). This case presents the question wheth\ner a veteran\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal within the\n120-day period should be regarded as having \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d consequences. We hold that it should not.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers\nthe federal program that provides benefits to veterans\nwith service-connected disabilities. The VA has a two-step\nprocess for the adjudication of these claims. First, a VA\nregional office receives and processes veterans\u2019 claims and\nmakes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny\n2                   HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbenefits. Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the\nregional office\u2019s decision, the veteran may obtain de novo\nreview by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. The Board is a\nbody within the VA that makes the agency\u2019s final decision\nin cases appealed to it. \u00a7\u00a77101, 7104(a).\n   The VA\u2019s adjudicatory \u201cprocess is designed to function\nthroughout with a high degree of informality and solici\ntude for the claimant.\u201d Walters v. National Assn. of Ra\ndiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985). A veteran\nfaces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is\nfiled, the VA\u2019s process for adjudicating it at the regional\noffice and the Board is ex parte and nonadversarial, 38\nCFR \u00a7\u00a73.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010). The VA has a statutory\nduty to assist veterans in developing the evidence neces\nsary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75103(a)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III), 5103A (2006 ed.). And when evaluat\ning claims, the VA must give veterans the \u201cbenefit of\nthe doubt\u201d whenever positive and negative evidence on\na material issue is roughly equal. \u00a75107(b). If a regional\noffice denies a claim, the veteran has a generous one-year\ntime limit to initiate an appeal to the Board. \u00a77105(b)(1);\n38 CFR \u00a720.302(a). A veteran may also reopen a previ\nously denied claim at any time by presenting \u201cnew and\nmaterial evidence,\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a75108, and decisions by a\nregional office or the Board are subject to challenge at any\ntime based on \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d \u00a7\u00a75109A,\n7111.\n   Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was rejected by the\nVA was generally unable to obtain further review. 38\nU. S. C. \u00a7211(a) (1988 ed.).1 But the Veterans\u2019 Judicial\nReview Act (VJRA), 102 Stat. 4105 (codified, as amended,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 211(a) did not foreclose judicial review of constitutional\n\nchallenges to veterans\u2019 benefits legislation, Johnson v. Robison, 415\nU. S. 361, 366\u2013374 (1974), or of challenges to VA benefits regulations\nbased on later-in-time statutes that the VA did not administer exclu\nsively, Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.

(2006 ed. and Supp. III)),\ncreated the Veterans Court, an Article I tribunal, and\nauthorized that court to review Board decisions adverse to\nveterans.2 \u00a7\u00a77251, 7252(a) (2006 ed.). While proceedings\nbefore the Veterans Court are adversarial, see \u00a77263,\nveterans have a remarkable record of success before that\ntribunal. Statistics compiled by the Veterans Court show\nthat in the last decade, the court ordered some form of\nrelief in around 79 percent of its \u201cmerits decisions.\u201d3\n   Review of Veterans Court decisions on certain issues of\nlaw is available in the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit. \u00a77292. Federal Circuit decisions may\nin turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certiorari.\n                               B\n  David Henderson served in the military during the\nKorean War. In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100\npercent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and\nin 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based\non his need for in-home care. After a VA regional office\nand the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal\nwith the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing\ndeadline by 15 days. See \u00a77266(a).\n  The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson\u2019s\nappeal as untimely. It concluded that Henderson was not\nentitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had\nnot shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.\nLater, the court granted Henderson\u2019s motion for reconsid\neration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argu\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 When such an appeal is taken, the Veterans Court\u2019s scope of review,\n\n\u00a77261, is similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706.\n  3 See United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Annual\n\nReports 2000\u20132009, http://uscourts.cavc.gov/documents/Annual_Report_\nFY_2009_October_1_2008_to_September_30_2009.pdf (as visited Feb.\n25, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n4                 HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment. While Henderson\u2019s appeal was pending, however,\nwe decided Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). In\nBowles, we held that the statutory limitation on the length\nof an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an\nordinary civil case, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107(c) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIII), is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and we therefore held that a party\u2019s\nfailure to file a notice of appeal within that period could\nnot be excused based on equitable factors, or on the oppos\ning party\u2019s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late\nfiling. Bowles, supra, at 213\u2013214.\n   After we announced our decision in Bowles, the Veter\nans Court directed the parties to brief that decision\u2019s effect\non prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equi\ntable tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of\nappeal in the Veterans Court. A divided panel of the\nVeterans Court concluded that Bowles compelled jurisdic\ntional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed\nHenderson\u2019s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nHenderson v. Peake, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vet. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\n   Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a\ndivided en banc court affirmed. 589 F. 3d 1201 (2009).\nWe granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n   In this case, as in others that have come before us in\nrecent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is\n\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559\nU. S. ___ (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engi\nneers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central\nRegion, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); Bowles, supra; Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006); Eberhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam); Scarborough v.\nPrincipi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443 (2004). This question is not merely semantic but one\nof considerable practical importance for judges and liti\ngants. Branding a rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial\nsystem. Under that system, courts are generally limited\nto addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the\nparties. See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331,\n356\u2013357 (2006). Courts do not usually raise claims or\narguments on their own. But federal courts have an inde\npendent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the\nscope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise\nand decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either\noverlook or elect not to press. See Arbaugh, supra, at 514.\n   Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of\njudicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.\nFor purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is\nreplete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised\nat particular times. See Sanchez-Llamas, supra, at 356\u2013\n357. Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however,\nmay be raised at any time. Thus, a party, after losing at\ntrial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at\n508. Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if\nthe party had previously acknowledged the trial court\u2019s\njurisdiction. Ibid. And if the trial court lacked jurisdic\ntion, many months of work on the part of the attorneys\nand the court may be wasted.\n   Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdic\ntional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent\ncases to bring some discipline to the use of this term. We\nhave urged that a rule should not be referred to as juris\ndictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity,\nthat is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. Reed\nElsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); Kontrick, supra, at\n455. Other rules, even if important and mandatory, we\nhave said, should not be given the jurisdictional brand.\nSee Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   Among the types of rules that should not be described as\njurisdictional are what we have called \u201cclaim-processing\n6                 HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrules.\u201d These are rules that seek to promote the orderly\nprogress of litigation by requiring that the parties take\ncertain procedural steps at certain specified times. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 14); Eberhart, supra, at 19; Scarborough,\nsupra, at 413\u2013414; Kontrick, supra, at 455\u2013456. Filing\ndeadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue\nhere, are quintessential claim-processing rules. Accord\ningly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of\njurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent\ncases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Cir\ncuit, and this opinion could end at this point.\n   Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that\nsimple because Congress is free to attach the conditions\nthat go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we\nwould prefer to call a claim-processing rule. See Bowles,\nsupra, at 212\u2013213. The question here, therefore, is\nwhether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be\n\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d In Arbaugh, we applied a \u201creadily admin\nistrable bright line\u201d rule for deciding such questions. 546\nU. S., at 515\u2013516. Under Arbaugh, we look to see if there\nis any \u201cclear\u201d indication that Congress wanted the rule to\nbe \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Ibid. This approach is suited to cap\nture Congress\u2019 likely intent and also provides helpful\nguidance for courts and litigants, who will be \u201cduly in\nstructed\u201d regarding a rule\u2019s nature. See id., at 514\u2013515,\nand n. 11.\n   Congress, of course, need not use magic words in order\nto speak clearly on this point. \u201c[C]ontext, including this\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years\npast, is relevant.\u201d Reed Elsevier, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n13). When \u201ca long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undis\nturbed by Congress,\u201d Union Pacific, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 13), has treated a similar requirement as \u201cjurisdic\ntional,\u201d we will presume that Congress intended to follow\nthat course. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013134, 139 (2008).\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                           III\n   With these principles in mind, we consider whether\nCongress clearly prescribed that the deadline for filing\na notice of appeal with the Veterans Court should be\n\u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n                               A\n   Contending that the 120-day filing deadline was meant\nto be jurisdictional, the Government maintains that\nBowles is controlling. The Government reads Bowles to\nmean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in\ncivil cases are jurisdictional. Since \u00a77266(a) establishes a\nstatutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the\nGovernment reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.\n   We reject the major premise of this syllogism. Bowles\ndid not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking\njudicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional. Instead,\nBowles concerned an appeal from one court to another\ncourt. The \u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent and practice in\nAmerican courts\u201d on which Bowles relied involved appeals\nof that type. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and n. 2.\n   Contending that Bowles\u2019 reasoning extends to the judi\ncial review of administrative decisions, the Government\nrelies on Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386 (1995). There, with\nout elaboration, we described as \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdic\ntional\u2019 \u201d the deadline for seeking review in the courts of\nappeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigra\ntion Appeals. Id., at 405 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 495\nU. S. 33, 45 (1990)). The Government also notes that\nlower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs\nAct\u2019s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of\ncertain final agency decisions, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72344, is juris\ndictional. Brief for United States 18.\n   Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans\nCourt review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in\nmany respects from court of appeals review of an agency\n8                HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision under the Hobbs Act. Cf. Shinseki v. Sanders,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (\u201cCongress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency\u201d). And\nthere is force to petitioner\u2019s argument that a more ap\npropriate analog is judicial review of an administrative\ndecision denying Social Security disability benefits. The\nSocial Security disability benefits program, like the veter\nans benefits program, is \u201cunusually protective\u201d of claim\nants, Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106\u2013107 (1984). See\nalso Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 110\u2013112 (2000) (plurality\nopinion). Indeed, the Government acknowledges that \u201cthe\nSocial Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms\nshare significant common attributes.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 16. And long before Congress enacted the VJRA,\nwe held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social\nSecurity benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7405(g), is not jurisdictional. Bowen v. City of New York,\n476 U. S. 467, 478, and n. 10 (1986); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 328, n. 9 (1976); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422\nU. S. 749, 763\u2013764 (1975).\n   In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the\nparties controls our decision here. All of those cases in\nvolved review by Article III courts. This case, by contrast,\ninvolves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique\nadministrative scheme. Instead of applying a categorical\nrule regarding review of administrative decisions, we\nattempt to ascertain Congress\u2019 intent regarding the par\nticular type of review at issue in this case.\n                             B\n  Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for\nseeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have\njurisdictional attributes.\n  The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38\nU. S. C. \u00a77266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear\nevidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdic\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional consequences. Section 7266(a) provides:\n    \u201cIn order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals\n    for Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board\n    of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, a person adversely affected by\n    such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the\n    Court within 120 days after the date on which notice\n    of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of\n    this title.\u201d\n  This provision \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or\nrefer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans\nCourt],\u201d Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385,\n394 (1982). If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to\nbe treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provi\nsion in language like that in the provision of the VJRA\nthat governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the\nVeterans Court. This latter provision states that Federal\nCircuit review must be obtained \u201cwithin the time and in\nthe manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts\nof appeals from United States district courts.\u201d \u00a77292(a).\nBecause the time for taking an appeal from a district court\nto a court of appeals in a civil case has long been under\nstood to be jurisdictional, see Bowles, supra, at 209\u2013210,\nand n. 2, this language clearly signals an intent to impose\nthe same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court\nto the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in\nthis case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true\nthat \u00a77266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have\nrejected the notion that \u201call mandatory prescriptions,\nhowever emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u201d\nUnion Pacific, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 510; internal quotation marks\nomitted). Thus, the language of \u00a77266 provides no clear\nindication that Congress wanted that provision to be\ntreated as having jurisdictional attributes.\n  Nor does \u00a77266\u2019s placement within the VJRA provide\n10                HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch an indication. Congress placed \u00a77266, numbered\n\u00a74066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled\n\u201cProcedure.\u201d See VJRA, \u00a7301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115\u20134116.\nThat placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day\nlimit as a claim-processing rule. Cf. INS v. National\nCenter for Immigrants\u2019 Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 189\n(1991) (\u201c[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolv\ning an ambiguity in the legislation\u2019s text\u201d). Congress\nelected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA sub\nchapter entitled \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction.\u201d See 102\nStat. 4113\u20134115.\n   Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned\n\u201cJurisdiction; finality of decisions,\u201d prescribes the jurisdic\ntion of the Veterans Court. Id., at 4113\u20134114. Subsection\n(a) of that provision, numbered \u00a74052 in the enacting\nlegislation, grants the Veterans Court \u201cexclusive jurisdic\ntion to review decisions of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals\u201d\nand the \u201cpower to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of\nthe Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.\u201d Id.,\nat 4113. It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals\nby the VA Secretary. Subsection (b) limits the court\u2019s\nreview to \u201cthe record of proceedings before the [VA],\u201d\nspecifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of\nthe VA\u2019s disability ratings schedule. Ibid. Nothing in this\nprovision or in the \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction\u201d sub\nchapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court\nreview.\n   While the terms and placement of \u00a77266 provide some\nindication of Congress\u2019 intent, what is most telling here\nare the singular characteristics of the review scheme that\nCongress created for the adjudication of veterans\u2019 benefits\nclaims. \u201cThe solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long\nstanding.\u201d United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647\n(1961); see also Sanders, 556 U.

See, e. g., Veterans Claims\nAssistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21,\n1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA, \u00a7103, 102 Stat. 4106\u20134107.\n   The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\u2014which\nprovided the context of our decision in Bowles\u2014and the\nsystem that Congress created for the adjudication of vet\nerans\u2019 benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic. In\nordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally com\nmence their suits within the time specified in a statute of\nlimitations, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658, and the litigation is\nadversarial. Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that\nsupports their claims and generally bear the burden of\nproduction and persuasion. Both parties may appeal an\nadverse trial-court decision, see \u00a71291, and a final judg\nment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.\n   By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an\ninitial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset\nof disability or separation from service. When a claim is\nfiled, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonad\nversarial. The VA is charged with the responsibility of\nassisting veterans in developing evidence that supports\ntheir claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must\ngive the veteran the benefit of any doubt. If a veteran is\nunsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may\nobtain de novo review before the Board, and if the veteran\nloses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further\nreview in the Veterans Court. A Board decision in the\nveteran\u2019s favor, on the other hand, is final. And even if a\nveteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of\nadministrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen\na claim simply by presenting \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d\nRigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash\n12                   HENDERSON v. SHINSEKI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsharply with this scheme.\n   We have long applied \u201cthe canon that provisions for\nbenefits to members of the Armed Services are to be con\nstrued in the beneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u201d King v. St. Vincent\u2019s\nHospital, 502 U. S. 215, 220\u2013221, n. 9 (1991); see also\nCoffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U. S. 191, 196 (1980);\nFishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S.\n275, 285 (1946). Particularly in light this canon, we do not\nfind any clear indication that the 120-day limit was in\ntended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany\nthe jurisdiction tag.\n   The Government argues that there is no reason to think\nthat jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent\nwith a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior\nto the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were\nnot subject to any further review at all. Brief for United\nStates 29. The provision at issue here, however, was\nenacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was\ndecidedly favorable to veterans. Accordingly, the review\nopportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was\nenacted are of little help in interpreting 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a77266(a).\n                            IV\n  We hold that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal\nwith the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional\nattributes. The 120-day limit is nevertheless an impor\ntant procedural rule. Whether this case falls within any\nexception to the rule is a question to be considered on\nremand.4\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The parties have not asked us to address whether the 120-day dead\n\nline in 38 U. S. C. \u00a77266(a) is subject to equitable tolling, nor has the\nGovernment disputed that the deadline is subject to equitable tolling if\nit is not jurisdictional. See Brief for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, we\nexpress no view on this question.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
