PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–400.      Argued November 2, 2010—Decided March 1, 2011\nWhile employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor\n Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army\n Reserve. Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulally’s su\n pervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations. Mu\n lally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive re\n quiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were\n completed. After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had\n violated the Corrective Action, Proctor’s vice president of human re\n sources (Buck) reviewed Staub’s personnel file and decided to fire\n him. Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated\n the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his\n military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision. Staub sued\n Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy\n ment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to\n deny “employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promo\n tion, or any benefit of employment” based on a person’s “membership”\n in or “obligation to perform service in a uniformed service,” 38\n U. S. C. §4311(a), and provides that liability is established “if the\n person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the employer’s ac\n tion,” §4311(c). He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostil\n ity to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were,\n and that their actions influenced Buck’s decision. A jury found Proc\n tor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit re\n versed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of\n law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulally’s and\n Korenchuk’s advice in making her decision.\nHeld:\n    1. If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary ani\n2                    STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    mus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employ\n    ment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate em\n    ployment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA. In con\n    struing the phrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action,” this\n    Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal\n    tort it adopts the background of general tort law. See, e.g., Burling\n    ton N. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Intentional\n    torts such as the one here “generally require that the actor intend\n    ‘the consequences’ of an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau\n    v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62. However, Proctor errs in contending\n    that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is\n    motivated by discriminatory animus. So long as the earlier agent in\n    tended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he\n    has the scienter required for USERRA liability. Moreover, it is axio\n    matic under tort law that the decisionmaker’s exercise of judgment\n    does not prevent the earlier agent’s action from being the proximate\n    cause of the harm. See Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559\n    U. S. 1, ___. Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker’s judgment be\n    deemed a superseding cause of the harm. See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v.\n    Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837. Proctor’s approach would have an im\n    probable consequence: If an employer isolates a personnel official\n    from its supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment\n    actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee’s\n    personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer\n    will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommen\n    dations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce\n    the adverse action. Proctor also errs in arguing that a decision\n    maker’s independent investigation, and rejection, of an employee’s\n    discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the\n    prior discrimination. Pp. 4–10.\n       2. Applying this analysis here, the Seventh Circuit erred in holding\n    that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Both Mu\n    lally and Korenchuk acted within the scope of their employment\n    when they took the actions that allegedly caused Buck to fire Staub.\n    There was also evidence that their actions were motivated by hostil\n    ity toward Staub’s military obligations, and that those actions were\n    causal factors underlying Buck’s decision. Finally, there was evi\n    dence that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to\n    cause Staub’s termination. The Seventh Circuit is to consider in the\n    first instance whether the variance between the jury instruction\n    given at trial and the rule adopted here was harmless error or should\n    mandate a new trial.

STAUB, PETITIONER v. PROCTOR \n\n                   HOSPITAL\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 1, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider the circumstances under which an em\nployer may be held liable for employment discrimination\nbased on the discriminatory animus of an employee who\ninfluenced, but did not make, the ultimate employment\ndecision.\n                                         I\n  Petitioner Vincent Staub worked as an angiography\ntechnician for respondent Proctor Hospital until 2004,\nwhen he was fired. Staub and Proctor hotly dispute the\nfacts surrounding the firing, but because a jury found for\nStaub in his claim of employment discrimination against\nProctor, we describe the facts viewed in the light most\nfavorable to him.\n  While employed by Proctor, Staub was a member of the\nUnited States Army Reserve, which required him to at\ntend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for\ntwo to three weeks a year. Both Janice Mulally, Staub’s\nimmediate supervisor, and Michael Korenchuk, Mulally’s\nsupervisor, were hostile to Staub’s military obligations.\nMulally scheduled Staub for additional shifts without\n2               STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice so that he would “ ‘pa[y] back the department for\neveryone else having to bend over backwards to cover [his]\nschedule for the Reserves.’ ” 560 F. 3d 647, 652 (CA7\n2009). She also informed Staub’s co-worker, Leslie Swe\nborg, that Staub’s “ ‘military duty had been a strain on\nth[e] department,’ ” and asked Sweborg to help her “ ‘get\nrid of him.’ ” Ibid. Korenchuk referred to Staub’s military\nobligations as “ ‘a b[u]nch of smoking and joking and [a]\nwaste of taxpayers[’] money.’ ” Ibid. He was also aware\nthat Mulally was “ ‘out to get’ ” Staub. Ibid.\n   In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a “Corrective\nAction” disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a\ncompany rule requiring him to stay in his work area\nwhenever he was not working with a patient. The Correc\ntive Action included a directive requiring Staub to report\nto Mulally or Korenchuk “ ‘when [he] ha[d] no patients and\n[the angio] cases [we]re complete[d].’ ” Id., at 653. Accord\ning to Staub, Mulally’s justification for the Corrective\nAction was false for two reasons: First, the company rule\ninvoked by Mulally did not exist; and second, even if it did,\nStaub did not violate it.\n   On April 2, 2004, Angie Day, Staub’s co-worker, com\nplained to Linda Buck, Proctor’s vice president of human\nresources, and Garrett McGowan, Proctor’s chief operating\nofficer, about Staub’s frequent unavailability and abrupt\nness. McGowan directed Korenchuk and Buck to create a\nplan that would solve Staub’s “ ‘availability’ problems.”\nId., at 654. But three weeks later, before they had time to\ndo so, Korenchuk informed Buck that Staub had left his\ndesk without informing a supervisor, in violation of the\nJanuary Corrective Action. Staub now contends this\naccusation was false: he had left Korenchuk a voice-mail\nnotification that he was leaving his desk. Buck relied on\nKorenchuk’s accusation, however, and after reviewing\nStaub’s personnel file, she decided to fire him. The termi\nnation notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nissued in the January 2004 Corrective Action.\n   Staub challenged his firing through Proctor’s grievance\nprocess, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allega\ntion underlying the Corrective Action out of hostility\ntoward his military obligations. Buck did not follow\nup with Mulally about this claim. After discussing the\nmatter with another personnel officer, Buck adhered to\nher decision.\n   Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Em\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38\nU. S. C. §4301 et seq., claiming that his discharge was\nmotivated by hostility to his obligations as a military\nreservist. His contention was not that Buck had any such\nhostility but that Mulally and Korenchuk did, and that\ntheir actions influenced Buck’s ultimate employment\ndecision. A jury found that Staub’s “military status was a\nmotivating factor in [Proctor’s] decision to discharge him,”\nApp. 68a, and awarded $57,640 in damages.\n   The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. 560 F. 3d 647.\nThe court observed that Staub had brought a “ ‘cat’s paw’\ncase,” meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable\nfor the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with\nmaking the ultimate employment decision. Id., at 655–\n656.1 It explained that under Seventh Circuit precedent, a\n“cat’s paw” case could not succeed unless the nondecision\nmaker exercised such “ ‘singular influence’ ” over the deci\n——————\n  1 The term “cat’s paw” derives from a fable conceived by Aesop, put\n\ninto verse by La Fontaine in 1679, and injected into United States\nemployment discrimination law by Posner in 1990. See Shager v.\nUpjohn Co., 913 F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7). In the fable, a monkey induces a\ncat by flattery to extract roasting chestnuts from the fire. After the cat\nhas done so, burning its paws in the process, the monkey makes off\nwith the chestnuts and leaves the cat with nothing. A coda to the fable\n(relevant only marginally, if at all, to employment law) observes that\nthe cat is similar to princes who, flattered by the king, perform services\non the king’s behalf and receive no reward.\n4               STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product\nof “blind reliance.” Id., at 659. It then noted that “Buck\nlooked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said,” relying\nin part on her conversation with Day and her review of\nStaub’s personnel file. Ibid. The court “admit[ted] that\nBuck’s investigation could have been more robust,” since it\n“failed to pursue Staub’s theory that Mulally fabricated\nthe write-up.” Ibid. But the court said that the “ ‘singular\ninfluence’ ” rule “does not require the decisionmaker to be\na paragon of independence”: “It is enough that the deci\nsionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single source of\ninformation and conducts her own investigation into the\nfacts relevant to the decision.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the undisputed evidence estab\nlished that Buck was not wholly dependent on the advice\nof Korenchuk and Mulally, the court held that Proctor was\nentitled to judgment. Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                          II\n   The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy\nment Rights Act (USERRA) provides in relevant part as\nfollows:\n       “A person who is a member of . . . or has an obliga\n    tion to perform service in a uniformed service shall\n    not be denied initial employment, reemployment, re\n    tention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of\n    employment by an employer on the basis of that\n    membership, . . . or obligation.” 38 U. S. C. §4311(a).\nIt elaborates further:\n      “An employer shall be considered to have engaged\n    in actions prohibited . . . under subsection (a), if the\n    person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the\n    employer’s action, unless the employer can prove that\n    the action would have been taken in the absence of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    such membership.” §4311(c).\nThe statute is very similar to Title VII, which prohibits\nemployment discrimination “because of . . . race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin” and states that such\ndiscrimination is established when one of those factors\n“was a motivating factor for any employment practice,\neven though other factors also motivated the practice.” 42\nU. S. C. §§2000e–2(a), (m).\n  The central difficulty in this case is construing the\nphrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action.” When\nthe company official who makes the decision to take an\nadverse employment action is personally acting out of\nhostility to the employee’s membership in or obligation to\na uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists.\nThe problem we confront arises when that official has no\ndiscriminatory animus but is influenced by previous com\npany action that is the product of a like animus in some\none else.\n  In approaching this question, we start from the premise\nthat when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the\nbackground of general tort law. See Burlington N. & S.\nF. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 13–14); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S.\n47, 68–69 (2007); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,\n524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998). Intentional torts such as this,\n“as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, . . .\ngenerally require that the actor intend ‘the consequences’\nof an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Gei\nger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62 (1998).\n  Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry\non the plaintiff’s personnel record was caused to be put\nthere, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Koren\nchuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and\nKorenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal. But\ndiscrimination was no part of Buck’s reason for the dis\n6              STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmissal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with\ndiscriminatory animus, the act they committed—the mere\nmaking of the reports—was not a denial of “initial em\nployment, reemployment, retention in employment, pro\nmotion, or any benefit of employment,” as liability under\nUSERRA requires. If dismissal was not the object of\nMulally’s and Korenchuk’s reports, it may have been\ntheir result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but\nthat is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk\nresponsible.\n  Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mu\nlally and Korenchuk, but their employer. Perhaps, there\nfore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer’s\nagents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the\nact of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor.\nAgain we consult general principles of law, agency law,\nwhich form the background against which federal tort\nlaws are enacted. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285\n(2003); Burlington, supra, at 754–755. Here, however, the\nanswer is not so clear. The Restatement of Agency sug\ngests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot\ngenerally be combined with the harmful action of another\nagent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires\nboth. See Restatement (Second) Agency §275, Illustration\n4 (1958). Some of the cases involving federal torts apply\nthat rule. See United States v. Science Applications Int’l\nCorp., 626 F. 3d 1257, 1273–1276 (CADC 2010); Chaney v.\nDreyfus Service Corp., 595 F. 3d 219, 241 (CA5 2010);\nUnited States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 566 F. 3d 1095,\n1122 (CADC 2009). But another case involving a federal\ntort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the con\ntrary. See United States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse\nSavannah River Co., 352 F. 3d 908, 918–919 (CA4 2003);\nUnited States v. Bank of New England, N. A., 821 F. 2d\n844, 856 (CA1 1987). Ultimately, we think it unnecessary\nin this case to decide what the background rule of agency\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw may be, since the former line of authority is suggested\nby the governing text, which requires that discrimination\nbe “a motivating factor” in the adverse action. When a\ndecision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the\npart of the firing agent, but partly on the basis of a report\nprompted (unbeknownst to that agent) by discrimination,\ndiscrimination might perhaps be called a “factor” or a\n“causal factor” in the decision; but it seems to us a consid\nerable stretch to call it “a motivating factor.”\n   Proctor, on the other hand, contends that the employer\nis not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker (the techni\ncal decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the “cat’s\npaw”) is motivated by discriminatory animus. This avoids\nthe aggregation of animus and adverse action, but it\nseems to us not the only application of general tort law\nthat can do so. Animus and responsibility for the adverse\naction can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here,\nStaub’s supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended\nconsequence of that agent’s discriminatory conduct. So\nlong as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that\nthe adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be\nliable under USERRA. And it is axiomatic under tort law\nthat the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does\nnot prevent the earlier agent’s action (and hence the ear\nlier agent’s discriminatory animus) from being the proxi\nmate cause of the harm. Proximate cause requires only\n“some direct relation between the injury asserted and the\ninjurious conduct alleged,” and excludes only those “link[s]\nthat are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.” Hemi\nGroup, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U. S. 1, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).2 We do\n——————\n  2 Under the traditional doctrine of proximate cause, a tortfeasor is\n\nsometimes, but not always, liable when he intends to cause an adverse\naction and a different adverse action results. See Restatement (Second)\nTorts §§435, 435B and Comment a (1963 and 1964). That issue is not\npresented in this case since the record contains no evidence that Mu\n8                 STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nnot think that the ultimate decisionmaker’s exercise of\njudgment automatically renders the link to the supervi\nsor’s bias “remote” or “purely contingent.” The decision\nmaker’s exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of\nthe employment decision, but it is common for injuries to\nhave multiple proximate causes. See Sosa v. Alvarez-\nMachain, 542 U. S. 692, 704 (2004). Nor can the ultimate\ndecisionmaker’s judgment be deemed a superseding cause\nof the harm. A cause can be thought “superseding” only if\nit is a “cause of independent origin that was not foresee\nable.” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837\n(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives\nan unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent\nemployer discrimination. An employer’s authority to\nreward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multi\nple agents. The one who makes the ultimate decision does\nso on the basis of performance assessments by other su\npervisors. Proctor’s view would have the improbable\nconsequence that if an employer isolates a personnel\nofficial from an employee’s supervisors, vests the decision\nto take adverse employment actions in that official, and\nasks that official to review the employee’s personnel file\nbefore taking the adverse action, then the employer will be\neffectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recom\nmendations of supervisors that were designed and in\ntended to produce the adverse action. That seems to us an\nimplausible meaning of the text, and one that is not com\npelled by its words.\n   Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker’s mere\nexercise of independent judgment does not suffice to ne\ngate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the\ndecisionmaker’s independent investigation (and rejection)\n—————— \n\nlally or Korenchuk intended any particular adverse action other than\n\nStaub’s termination.\n\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the employee’s allegations of discriminatory animus\nought to do so. We decline to adopt such a hard-and-fast\nrule. As we have already acknowledged, the requirement\nthat the biased supervisor’s action be a causal factor of the\nultimate employment action incorporates the traditional\ntort-law concept of proximate cause. See, e.g., Anza v.\nIdeal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 457–458 (2006);\nSosa, supra, at 703. Thus, if the employer’s investigation\nresults in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the\nsupervisor’s original biased action (by the terms of\nUSERRA it is the employer’s burden to establish that),\nthen the employer will not be liable. But the supervisor’s\nbiased report may remain a causal factor if the independ\nent investigation takes it into account without determin\ning that the adverse action was, apart from the supervi\nsor’s recommendation, entirely justified. We are aware of\nno principle in tort or agency law under which an em\nployer’s mere conduct of an independent investigation has\na claim-preclusive effect. Nor do we think the independ\nent investigation somehow relieves the employer of “fault.”\nThe employer is at fault because one of its agents commit\nted an action based on discriminatory animus that was\nintended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse em\nployment decision.\n  JUSTICE ALITO claims that our failure to adopt a rule\nimmunizing an employer who performs an independent\ninvestigation reflects a “stray[ing] from the statutory\ntext.” Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). We do\nnot understand this accusation. Since a supervisor is an\nagent of the employer, when he causes an adverse em\nployment action the employer causes it; and when dis\ncrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a\n“motivating factor in the employer’s action,” precisely as\nthe text requires. JUSTICE ALITO suggests that the em\nployer should be held liable only when it “should be re\ngarded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking\n10                 STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npower” to the biased supervisor. Ibid. But if the inde\npendent investigation relies on facts provided by the bi\nased supervisor—as is necessary in any case of cat’s-paw\nliability—then the employer (either directly or through\nthe ultimate decisionmaker) will have effectively delegated\nthe factfinding portion of the investigation to the biased\nsupervisor. Contrary to JUSTICE ALITO’s suggestion, the\nbiased supervisor is not analogous to a witness at a bench\ntrial. The mere witness is not an actor in the events that\nare the subject of the trial. The biased supervisor and the\nultimate decisionmaker, however, acted as agents of the\nentity that the plaintiff seeks to hold liable; each of them\npossessed supervisory authority delegated by their em\nployer and exercised it in the interest of their employer.\nIn sum, we do not see how “fidelity to the statutory text,”\nibid., requires the adoption of an independent\ninvestigation defense that appears nowhere in the text.\nAnd we find both speculative and implausible JUSTICE\nALITO’s prediction that our Nation’s employers will sys\ntematically disfavor members of the armed services in\ntheir hiring decisions to avoid the possibility of cat’s-paw\nliability, a policy that would violate USERRA in any\nevent.\n   We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act\nmotivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the\nsupervisor to cause an adverse employment action,3 and if\nthat act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment\naction, then the employer is liable under USERRA. 4\n——————\n  3 Under  traditional tort law, “ ‘intent’ . . . denote[s] that the actor\ndesires to cause consequences of his act, or that he believes that the\nconsequences are substantially certain to result from it.” Id., §8A.\n  4 Needless to say, the employer would be liable only when the super\n\nvisor acts within the scope of his employment, or when the supervisor\nacts outside the scope of his employment and liability would be imputed\nto the employer under traditional agency principles.

A “reprimand . . . for\nworkplace failings” constitutes conduct within the scope of\nan agent’s employment. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524\nU. S. 775, 798–799 (1998). As the Seventh Circuit recog\nnized, there was evidence that Mulally’s and Korenchuk’s\nactions were motivated by hostility toward Staub’s mili\ntary obligations. There was also evidence that Mulally’s\nand Korenchuk’s actions were causal factors underlying\nBuck’s decision to fire Staub. Buck’s termination notice\nexpressly stated that Staub was terminated because he\nhad “ignored” the directive in the Corrective Action. Fi\nnally, there was evidence that both Mulally and Koren\nchuk had the specific intent to cause Staub to be termi\nnated. Mulally stated she was trying to “ ‘get rid of ’ ”\nStaub, and Korenchuk was aware that Mulally was “ ‘out\nto get’ ” Staub. Moreover, Korenchuk informed Buck,\nProctor’s personnel officer responsible for terminating\nemployees, of Staub’s alleged noncompliance with Mu\nlally’s Corrective Action, and Buck fired Staub immedi\nately thereafter; a reasonable jury could infer that Koren\nchuk intended that Staub be fired. The Seventh Circuit\ntherefore erred in holding that Proctor was entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\n  It is less clear whether the jury’s verdict should be\nreinstated or whether Proctor is entitled to a new trial.\n——————\nview as to whether the employer would be liable if a co-worker, rather\nthan a supervisor, committed a discriminatory act that influenced the\nultimate employment decision. We also observe that Staub took advan\ntage of Proctor’s grievance process, and we express no view as to\nwhether Proctor would have an affirmative defense if he did not.

STAUB, PETITIONER v. PROCTOR \n\n                   HOSPITAL\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 1, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n  I agree with the Court that the decision of the Court of\nAppeals must be reversed, but I would do so based on the\nstatutory text, rather than principles of agency and tort\nlaw that do not speak directly to the question presented\nhere.\n  The relevant statutory provision states:\n    “An employer shall be considered to have engaged in\n    [prohibited discrimination against a member of one of\n    the uniformed services] if the person’s membership\n    . . . is a motivating factor in the employer’s action,\n    unless the employer can prove that the action would\n    have been taken in the absence of such membership\n    . . . .” 38 U. S. C. §4311(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n    For present purposes, the key phrase is “a motivating\nfactor in the employer’s action.” A “motivating factor” is a\nfactor that “provide[s] . . . a motive.” See Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1475 (1971) (defining “moti\nvate”). A “motive,” in turn, is “something within a person\n. . . that incites him to action.” Ibid. Thus, in order for\ndiscrimination to be “a motivating factor in [an] em\nployer’s action,” discrimination must be present “within,”\ni.e., in the mind of, the person who makes the decision to\n2              STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntake that action. And “the employer’s action” here is the\ndecision to fire petitioner. Thus, petitioner, in order to\nrecover, was required to show that discrimination moti\nvated that action.\n   The Court, however, strays from the statutory text by\nholding that it is enough for an employee to show that\ndiscrimination motivated some other action and that this\nlatter action, in turn, caused the termination decision.\nThat is simply not what the statute says.\n   The Court fears this interpretation of the statute would\nallow an employer to escape liability by assigning formal\ndecisionmaking authority to an officer who may merely\nrubberstamp the recommendation of others who are moti\nvated by antimilitary animus. See ante, at 8. But fidelity\nto the statutory text does not lead to this result. Where\nthe officer with formal decisionmaking authority merely\nrubberstamps the recommendation of others, the em\nployer, I would hold, has actually delegated the decision\nmaking responsibility to those whose recommendation is\nrubberstamped. I would reach a similar conclusion where\nthe officer with the formal decisionmaking authority is put\non notice that adverse information about an employee may\nbe based on antimilitary animus but does not undertake\nan independent investigation of the matter. In that situa\ntion, too, the employer should be regarded as having dele\ngated part of the decisionmaking power to those who are\nresponsible for memorializing and transmitting the ad\nverse information that is accepted without examination.\nThe same cannot be said, however, where the officer with\nformal decisionmaking responsibility, having been alerted\nto the possibility that adverse information may be tainted,\nundertakes a reasonable investigation and finds insuffi\ncient evidence to dispute the accuracy of that information.\n   Nor can the employer be said to have “effectively dele\ngated” decisionmaking authority any time a decision\nmaker “relies on facts provided by [a] biased supervisor.”\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSee ante, at 10. A decisionmaker who credits information\nprovided by another person—for example, a judge who\ncredits the testimony of a witness in a bench trial—does\nnot thereby delegate a portion of the decisionmaking\nauthority to the person who provides the information.\n   This interpretation of §4311(c)(1) heeds the statutory\ntext and would provide fair treatment for both employers\nand employees who are members of the uniformed ser\nvices. It would also encourage employers to establish\ninternal grievance procedures similar to those that have\nbeen adopted following our decisions in Burlington Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v.\nBoca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998). Such procedures would\noften provide relief for employees without the need for\nlitigation, and they would provide protection for employers\nwho proceed in good faith.\n   The Court’s contrary approach, by contrast, is almost\ncertain to lead to confusion and is likely to produce results\nthat will not serve the interests of either employers or\nemployees who are members of the uniformed services.\nThe Court’s holding will impose liability unfairly on em\nployers who make every effort to comply with the law, and\nit may have the perverse effect of discouraging employers\nfrom hiring applicants who are members of the Reserves\nor the National Guard. In addition, by leaving open the\npossibility that an employer may be held liable if it inno\ncently takes into account adverse information provided,\nnot by a supervisor, but by a low-level employee, see ante,\nat 10–11, n. 4, the Court increases the confusion that its\ndecision is likely to produce.\n   For these reasons, I cannot accept the Court’s interpre\ntation of §4311(c)(1), but I nevertheless agree that the\ndecision below must be reversed. There was sufficient\nevidence to support a finding that at least Korenchuk was\nactually delegated part of the decisionmaking authority in\nthis case. Korenchuk was the head of the unit in which\nStaub worked and it was Korenchuk who told Buck that\n4                  STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nStaub left his work area without informing his supervi\nsors. There was evidence that Korenchuk’s accusation\nformed the basis of Buck’s decision to fire Staub, and that\nBuck simply accepted the accusation at face value. Ac\ncording to one version of events, Buck fired Staub immedi\nately after Korenchuk informed her of Staub’s alleged\nmisconduct, and she cited only that misconduct in the\ntermination notice provided to Staub. See 5 Record 128–\n129, 267–268, 380–386; App. 74a. All of this is enough to\nshow that Korenchuk was in effect delegated some of\nBuck’s termination authority. There was also evidence\nfrom which it may be inferred that displeasure with\nStaub’s Reserve responsibilities was a motivating factor in\nKorenchuk’s actions.*\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   * See 5 Record 343–344 (testimony that Korenchuk made negative\nremarks about Staub’s Reserve duties before firing him in 1998); id., at\n124–126, 352 (testimony that Korenchuk informed Staub of the revenue\nlost while he was on Active Duty in 2003, that Korenchuk was aware in\nJanuary 2004 that Staub might be called to Active Duty again, and that\n“[b]udget was a big issue with [Korenchuk]”).\n</pre>", "id": 205713, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/03/01/Staub_v._Proctor_Hospital.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–400.      Argued November 2, 2010—Decided March 1, 2011\nWhile employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor\n Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army\n Reserve. Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulally’s su\n pervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations. Mu\n lally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive re\n quiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were\n completed. After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had\n violated the Corrective Action, Proctor’s vice president of human re\n sources (Buck) reviewed Staub’s personnel file and decided to fire\n him. Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated\n the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his\n military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision. Staub sued\n Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy\n ment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to\n deny “employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promo\n tion, or any benefit of employment” based on a person’s “membership”\n in or “obligation to perform service in a uniformed service,” 38\n U. S. C. §4311(a), and provides that liability is established “if the\n person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the employer’s ac\n tion,” §4311(c). He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostil\n ity to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were,\n and that their actions influenced Buck’s decision. A jury found Proc\n tor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit re\n versed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of\n law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulally’s and\n Korenchuk’s advice in making her decision.\nHeld:\n    1. If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary ani\n2                    STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    mus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employ\n    ment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate em\n    ployment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA. In con\n    struing the phrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action,” this\n    Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal\n    tort it adopts the background of general tort law. See, e.g., Burling\n    ton N. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Intentional\n    torts such as the one here “generally require that the actor intend\n    ‘the consequences’ of an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau\n    v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62. However, Proctor errs in contending\n    that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is\n    motivated by discriminatory animus. So long as the earlier agent in\n    tended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he\n    has the scienter required for USERRA liability. Moreover, it is axio\n    matic under tort law that the decisionmaker’s exercise of judgment\n    does not prevent the earlier agent’s action from being the proximate\n    cause of the harm. See Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559\n    U. S. 1, ___. Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker’s judgment be\n    deemed a superseding cause of the harm. See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v.\n    Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837. Proctor’s approach would have an im\n    probable consequence: If an employer isolates a personnel official\n    from its supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment\n    actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee’s\n    personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer\n    will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommen\n    dations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce\n    the adverse action. Proctor also errs in arguing that a decision\n    maker’s independent investigation, and rejection, of an employee’s\n    discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the\n    prior discrimination. Pp. 4–10.\n       2. Applying this analysis here, the Seventh Circuit erred in holding\n    that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Both Mu\n    lally and Korenchuk acted within the scope of their employment\n    when they took the actions that allegedly caused Buck to fire Staub.\n    There was also evidence that their actions were motivated by hostil\n    ity toward Staub’s military obligations, and that those actions were\n    causal factors underlying Buck’s decision. Finally, there was evi\n    dence that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to\n    cause Staub’s termination. The Seventh Circuit is to consider in the\n    first instance whether the variance between the jury instruction\n    given at trial and the rule adopted here was harmless error or should\n    mandate a new trial.

Staub and Proctor hotly dispute the\nfacts surrounding the firing, but because a jury found for\nStaub in his claim of employment discrimination against\nProctor, we describe the facts viewed in the light most\nfavorable to him.\n  While employed by Proctor, Staub was a member of the\nUnited States Army Reserve, which required him to at\ntend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for\ntwo to three weeks a year. Both Janice Mulally, Staub’s\nimmediate supervisor, and Michael Korenchuk, Mulally’s\nsupervisor, were hostile to Staub’s military obligations.\nMulally scheduled Staub for additional shifts without\n2               STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice so that he would “ ‘pa[y] back the department for\neveryone else having to bend over backwards to cover [his]\nschedule for the Reserves.’ ” 560 F. 3d 647, 652 (CA7\n2009). She also informed Staub’s co-worker, Leslie Swe\nborg, that Staub’s “ ‘military duty had been a strain on\nth[e] department,’ ” and asked Sweborg to help her “ ‘get\nrid of him.’ ” Ibid. Korenchuk referred to Staub’s military\nobligations as “ ‘a b[u]nch of smoking and joking and [a]\nwaste of taxpayers[’] money.’ ” Ibid. He was also aware\nthat Mulally was “ ‘out to get’ ” Staub. Ibid.\n   In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a “Corrective\nAction” disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a\ncompany rule requiring him to stay in his work area\nwhenever he was not working with a patient. The Correc\ntive Action included a directive requiring Staub to report\nto Mulally or Korenchuk “ ‘when [he] ha[d] no patients and\n[the angio] cases [we]re complete[d].’ ” Id., at 653. Accord\ning to Staub, Mulally’s justification for the Corrective\nAction was false for two reasons: First, the company rule\ninvoked by Mulally did not exist; and second, even if it did,\nStaub did not violate it.\n   On April 2, 2004, Angie Day, Staub’s co-worker, com\nplained to Linda Buck, Proctor’s vice president of human\nresources, and Garrett McGowan, Proctor’s chief operating\nofficer, about Staub’s frequent unavailability and abrupt\nness. McGowan directed Korenchuk and Buck to create a\nplan that would solve Staub’s “ ‘availability’ problems.”\nId., at 654. But three weeks later, before they had time to\ndo so, Korenchuk informed Buck that Staub had left his\ndesk without informing a supervisor, in violation of the\nJanuary Corrective Action. Staub now contends this\naccusation was false: he had left Korenchuk a voice-mail\nnotification that he was leaving his desk. Buck relied on\nKorenchuk’s accusation, however, and after reviewing\nStaub’s personnel file, she decided to fire him. The termi\nnation notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nissued in the January 2004 Corrective Action.\n   Staub challenged his firing through Proctor’s grievance\nprocess, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allega\ntion underlying the Corrective Action out of hostility\ntoward his military obligations. Buck did not follow\nup with Mulally about this claim. After discussing the\nmatter with another personnel officer, Buck adhered to\nher decision.\n   Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Em\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38\nU. S. C. §4301 et seq., claiming that his discharge was\nmotivated by hostility to his obligations as a military\nreservist. His contention was not that Buck had any such\nhostility but that Mulally and Korenchuk did, and that\ntheir actions influenced Buck’s ultimate employment\ndecision. A jury found that Staub’s “military status was a\nmotivating factor in [Proctor’s] decision to discharge him,”\nApp. 68a, and awarded $57,640 in damages.\n   The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. 560 F. 3d 647.\nThe court observed that Staub had brought a “ ‘cat’s paw’\ncase,” meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable\nfor the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with\nmaking the ultimate employment decision. Id., at 655–\n656.1 It explained that under Seventh Circuit precedent, a\n“cat’s paw” case could not succeed unless the nondecision\nmaker exercised such “ ‘singular influence’ ” over the deci\n——————\n  1 The term “cat’s paw” derives from a fable conceived by Aesop, put\n\ninto verse by La Fontaine in 1679, and injected into United States\nemployment discrimination law by Posner in 1990. See Shager v.\nUpjohn Co., 913 F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7). In the fable, a monkey induces a\ncat by flattery to extract roasting chestnuts from the fire. After the cat\nhas done so, burning its paws in the process, the monkey makes off\nwith the chestnuts and leaves the cat with nothing. A coda to the fable\n(relevant only marginally, if at all, to employment law) observes that\nthe cat is similar to princes who, flattered by the king, perform services\non the king’s behalf and receive no reward.\n4               STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product\nof “blind reliance.” Id., at 659. It then noted that “Buck\nlooked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said,” relying\nin part on her conversation with Day and her review of\nStaub’s personnel file. Ibid. The court “admit[ted] that\nBuck’s investigation could have been more robust,” since it\n“failed to pursue Staub’s theory that Mulally fabricated\nthe write-up.” Ibid. But the court said that the “ ‘singular\ninfluence’ ” rule “does not require the decisionmaker to be\na paragon of independence”: “It is enough that the deci\nsionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single source of\ninformation and conducts her own investigation into the\nfacts relevant to the decision.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the undisputed evidence estab\nlished that Buck was not wholly dependent on the advice\nof Korenchuk and Mulally, the court held that Proctor was\nentitled to judgment. Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                          II\n   The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemploy\nment Rights Act (USERRA) provides in relevant part as\nfollows:\n       “A person who is a member of . . . or has an obliga\n    tion to perform service in a uniformed service shall\n    not be denied initial employment, reemployment, re\n    tention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of\n    employment by an employer on the basis of that\n    membership, . . . or obligation.” 38 U. S. C. §4311(a).\nIt elaborates further:\n      “An employer shall be considered to have engaged\n    in actions prohibited . . . under subsection (a), if the\n    person’s membership . . . is a motivating factor in the\n    employer’s action, unless the employer can prove that\n    the action would have been taken in the absence of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    such membership.” §4311(c).\nThe statute is very similar to Title VII, which prohibits\nemployment discrimination “because of . . . race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin” and states that such\ndiscrimination is established when one of those factors\n“was a motivating factor for any employment practice,\neven though other factors also motivated the practice.” 42\nU. S. C. §§2000e–2(a), (m).\n  The central difficulty in this case is construing the\nphrase “motivating factor in the employer’s action.” When\nthe company official who makes the decision to take an\nadverse employment action is personally acting out of\nhostility to the employee’s membership in or obligation to\na uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists.\nThe problem we confront arises when that official has no\ndiscriminatory animus but is influenced by previous com\npany action that is the product of a like animus in some\none else.\n  In approaching this question, we start from the premise\nthat when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the\nbackground of general tort law. See Burlington N. & S.\nF. R. Co. v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 13–14); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S.\n47, 68–69 (2007); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,\n524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998). Intentional torts such as this,\n“as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, . . .\ngenerally require that the actor intend ‘the consequences’\nof an act,’ not simply ‘the act itself.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Gei\nger, 523 U. S. 57, 61–62 (1998).\n  Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry\non the plaintiff’s personnel record was caused to be put\nthere, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Koren\nchuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and\nKorenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal. But\ndiscrimination was no part of Buck’s reason for the dis\n6              STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmissal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with\ndiscriminatory animus, the act they committed—the mere\nmaking of the reports—was not a denial of “initial em\nployment, reemployment, retention in employment, pro\nmotion, or any benefit of employment,” as liability under\nUSERRA requires. If dismissal was not the object of\nMulally’s and Korenchuk’s reports, it may have been\ntheir result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but\nthat is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk\nresponsible.\n  Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mu\nlally and Korenchuk, but their employer. Perhaps, there\nfore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer’s\nagents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the\nact of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor.\nAgain we consult general principles of law, agency law,\nwhich form the background against which federal tort\nlaws are enacted. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285\n(2003); Burlington, supra, at 754–755. Here, however, the\nanswer is not so clear. The Restatement of Agency sug\ngests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot\ngenerally be combined with the harmful action of another\nagent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires\nboth. See Restatement (Second) Agency §275, Illustration\n4 (1958). Some of the cases involving federal torts apply\nthat rule. See United States v. Science Applications Int’l\nCorp., 626 F. 3d 1257, 1273–1276 (CADC 2010); Chaney v.\nDreyfus Service Corp., 595 F. 3d 219, 241 (CA5 2010);\nUnited States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 566 F. 3d 1095,\n1122 (CADC 2009). But another case involving a federal\ntort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the con\ntrary. See United States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse\nSavannah River Co., 352 F. 3d 908, 918–919 (CA4 2003);\nUnited States v. Bank of New England, N. A., 821 F. 2d\n844, 856 (CA1 1987). Ultimately, we think it unnecessary\nin this case to decide what the background rule of agency\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw may be, since the former line of authority is suggested\nby the governing text, which requires that discrimination\nbe “a motivating factor” in the adverse action. When a\ndecision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the\npart of the firing agent, but partly on the basis of a report\nprompted (unbeknownst to that agent) by discrimination,\ndiscrimination might perhaps be called a “factor” or a\n“causal factor” in the decision; but it seems to us a consid\nerable stretch to call it “a motivating factor.”\n   Proctor, on the other hand, contends that the employer\nis not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker (the techni\ncal decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the “cat’s\npaw”) is motivated by discriminatory animus. This avoids\nthe aggregation of animus and adverse action, but it\nseems to us not the only application of general tort law\nthat can do so. Animus and responsibility for the adverse\naction can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here,\nStaub’s supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended\nconsequence of that agent’s discriminatory conduct. So\nlong as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that\nthe adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be\nliable under USERRA. And it is axiomatic under tort law\nthat the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does\nnot prevent the earlier agent’s action (and hence the ear\nlier agent’s discriminatory animus) from being the proxi\nmate cause of the harm. Proximate cause requires only\n“some direct relation between the injury asserted and the\ninjurious conduct alleged,” and excludes only those “link[s]\nthat are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.” Hemi\nGroup, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U. S. 1, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).2 We do\n——————\n  2 Under the traditional doctrine of proximate cause, a tortfeasor is\n\nsometimes, but not always, liable when he intends to cause an adverse\naction and a different adverse action results. See Restatement (Second)\nTorts §§435, 435B and Comment a (1963 and 1964). That issue is not\npresented in this case since the record contains no evidence that Mu\n8                 STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nnot think that the ultimate decisionmaker’s exercise of\njudgment automatically renders the link to the supervi\nsor’s bias “remote” or “purely contingent.” The decision\nmaker’s exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of\nthe employment decision, but it is common for injuries to\nhave multiple proximate causes. See Sosa v. Alvarez-\nMachain, 542 U. S. 692, 704 (2004). Nor can the ultimate\ndecisionmaker’s judgment be deemed a superseding cause\nof the harm. A cause can be thought “superseding” only if\nit is a “cause of independent origin that was not foresee\nable.” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 837\n(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives\nan unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent\nemployer discrimination. An employer’s authority to\nreward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multi\nple agents. The one who makes the ultimate decision does\nso on the basis of performance assessments by other su\npervisors. Proctor’s view would have the improbable\nconsequence that if an employer isolates a personnel\nofficial from an employee’s supervisors, vests the decision\nto take adverse employment actions in that official, and\nasks that official to review the employee’s personnel file\nbefore taking the adverse action, then the employer will be\neffectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recom\nmendations of supervisors that were designed and in\ntended to produce the adverse action. That seems to us an\nimplausible meaning of the text, and one that is not com\npelled by its words.\n   Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker’s mere\nexercise of independent judgment does not suffice to ne\ngate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the\ndecisionmaker’s independent investigation (and rejection)\n—————— \n\nlally or Korenchuk intended any particular adverse action other than\n\nStaub’s termination.\n\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the employee’s allegations of discriminatory animus\nought to do so. We decline to adopt such a hard-and-fast\nrule. As we have already acknowledged, the requirement\nthat the biased supervisor’s action be a causal factor of the\nultimate employment action incorporates the traditional\ntort-law concept of proximate cause. See, e.g., Anza v.\nIdeal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 457–458 (2006);\nSosa, supra, at 703. Thus, if the employer’s investigation\nresults in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the\nsupervisor’s original biased action (by the terms of\nUSERRA it is the employer’s burden to establish that),\nthen the employer will not be liable. But the supervisor’s\nbiased report may remain a causal factor if the independ\nent investigation takes it into account without determin\ning that the adverse action was, apart from the supervi\nsor’s recommendation, entirely justified. We are aware of\nno principle in tort or agency law under which an em\nployer’s mere conduct of an independent investigation has\na claim-preclusive effect. Nor do we think the independ\nent investigation somehow relieves the employer of “fault.”\nThe employer is at fault because one of its agents commit\nted an action based on discriminatory animus that was\nintended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse em\nployment decision.\n  JUSTICE ALITO claims that our failure to adopt a rule\nimmunizing an employer who performs an independent\ninvestigation reflects a “stray[ing] from the statutory\ntext.” Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). We do\nnot understand this accusation. Since a supervisor is an\nagent of the employer, when he causes an adverse em\nployment action the employer causes it; and when dis\ncrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a\n“motivating factor in the employer’s action,” precisely as\nthe text requires. JUSTICE ALITO suggests that the em\nployer should be held liable only when it “should be re\ngarded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking\n10                 STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npower” to the biased supervisor. Ibid. But if the inde\npendent investigation relies on facts provided by the bi\nased supervisor—as is necessary in any case of cat’s-paw\nliability—then the employer (either directly or through\nthe ultimate decisionmaker) will have effectively delegated\nthe factfinding portion of the investigation to the biased\nsupervisor. Contrary to JUSTICE ALITO’s suggestion, the\nbiased supervisor is not analogous to a witness at a bench\ntrial. The mere witness is not an actor in the events that\nare the subject of the trial. The biased supervisor and the\nultimate decisionmaker, however, acted as agents of the\nentity that the plaintiff seeks to hold liable; each of them\npossessed supervisory authority delegated by their em\nployer and exercised it in the interest of their employer.\nIn sum, we do not see how “fidelity to the statutory text,”\nibid., requires the adoption of an independent\ninvestigation defense that appears nowhere in the text.\nAnd we find both speculative and implausible JUSTICE\nALITO’s prediction that our Nation’s employers will sys\ntematically disfavor members of the armed services in\ntheir hiring decisions to avoid the possibility of cat’s-paw\nliability, a policy that would violate USERRA in any\nevent.\n   We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act\nmotivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the\nsupervisor to cause an adverse employment action,3 and if\nthat act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment\naction, then the employer is liable under USERRA. 4\n——————\n  3 Under  traditional tort law, “ ‘intent’ . . . denote[s] that the actor\ndesires to cause consequences of his act, or that he believes that the\nconsequences are substantially certain to result from it.” Id., §8A.\n  4 Needless to say, the employer would be liable only when the super\n\nvisor acts within the scope of his employment, or when the supervisor\nacts outside the scope of his employment and liability would be imputed\nto the employer under traditional agency principles.

A “reprimand . . . for\nworkplace failings” constitutes conduct within the scope of\nan agent’s employment. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524\nU. S. 775, 798–799 (1998). As the Seventh Circuit recog\nnized, there was evidence that Mulally’s and Korenchuk’s\nactions were motivated by hostility toward Staub’s mili\ntary obligations. There was also evidence that Mulally’s\nand Korenchuk’s actions were causal factors underlying\nBuck’s decision to fire Staub. Buck’s termination notice\nexpressly stated that Staub was terminated because he\nhad “ignored” the directive in the Corrective Action. Fi\nnally, there was evidence that both Mulally and Koren\nchuk had the specific intent to cause Staub to be termi\nnated. Mulally stated she was trying to “ ‘get rid of ’ ”\nStaub, and Korenchuk was aware that Mulally was “ ‘out\nto get’ ” Staub. Moreover, Korenchuk informed Buck,\nProctor’s personnel officer responsible for terminating\nemployees, of Staub’s alleged noncompliance with Mu\nlally’s Corrective Action, and Buck fired Staub immedi\nately thereafter; a reasonable jury could infer that Koren\nchuk intended that Staub be fired. The Seventh Circuit\ntherefore erred in holding that Proctor was entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\n  It is less clear whether the jury’s verdict should be\nreinstated or whether Proctor is entitled to a new trial.\n——————\nview as to whether the employer would be liable if a co-worker, rather\nthan a supervisor, committed a discriminatory act that influenced the\nultimate employment decision. We also observe that Staub took advan\ntage of Proctor’s grievance process, and we express no view as to\nwhether Proctor would have an affirmative defense if he did not.

S. C. §4311(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n    For present purposes, the key phrase is “a motivating\nfactor in the employer’s action.” A “motivating factor” is a\nfactor that “provide[s] . . . a motive.” See Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1475 (1971) (defining “moti\nvate”). A “motive,” in turn, is “something within a person\n. . . that incites him to action.” Ibid. Thus, in order for\ndiscrimination to be “a motivating factor in [an] em\nployer’s action,” discrimination must be present “within,”\ni.e., in the mind of, the person who makes the decision to\n2              STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntake that action. And “the employer’s action” here is the\ndecision to fire petitioner. Thus, petitioner, in order to\nrecover, was required to show that discrimination moti\nvated that action.\n   The Court, however, strays from the statutory text by\nholding that it is enough for an employee to show that\ndiscrimination motivated some other action and that this\nlatter action, in turn, caused the termination decision.\nThat is simply not what the statute says.\n   The Court fears this interpretation of the statute would\nallow an employer to escape liability by assigning formal\ndecisionmaking authority to an officer who may merely\nrubberstamp the recommendation of others who are moti\nvated by antimilitary animus. See ante, at 8. But fidelity\nto the statutory text does not lead to this result. Where\nthe officer with formal decisionmaking authority merely\nrubberstamps the recommendation of others, the em\nployer, I would hold, has actually delegated the decision\nmaking responsibility to those whose recommendation is\nrubberstamped. I would reach a similar conclusion where\nthe officer with the formal decisionmaking authority is put\non notice that adverse information about an employee may\nbe based on antimilitary animus but does not undertake\nan independent investigation of the matter. In that situa\ntion, too, the employer should be regarded as having dele\ngated part of the decisionmaking power to those who are\nresponsible for memorializing and transmitting the ad\nverse information that is accepted without examination.\nThe same cannot be said, however, where the officer with\nformal decisionmaking responsibility, having been alerted\nto the possibility that adverse information may be tainted,\nundertakes a reasonable investigation and finds insuffi\ncient evidence to dispute the accuracy of that information.\n   Nor can the employer be said to have “effectively dele\ngated” decisionmaking authority any time a decision\nmaker “relies on facts provided by [a] biased supervisor.”\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSee ante, at 10. A decisionmaker who credits information\nprovided by another person—for example, a judge who\ncredits the testimony of a witness in a bench trial—does\nnot thereby delegate a portion of the decisionmaking\nauthority to the person who provides the information.\n   This interpretation of §4311(c)(1) heeds the statutory\ntext and would provide fair treatment for both employers\nand employees who are members of the uniformed ser\nvices. It would also encourage employers to establish\ninternal grievance procedures similar to those that have\nbeen adopted following our decisions in Burlington Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v.\nBoca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998). Such procedures would\noften provide relief for employees without the need for\nlitigation, and they would provide protection for employers\nwho proceed in good faith.\n   The Court’s contrary approach, by contrast, is almost\ncertain to lead to confusion and is likely to produce results\nthat will not serve the interests of either employers or\nemployees who are members of the uniformed services.\nThe Court’s holding will impose liability unfairly on em\nployers who make every effort to comply with the law, and\nit may have the perverse effect of discouraging employers\nfrom hiring applicants who are members of the Reserves\nor the National Guard. In addition, by leaving open the\npossibility that an employer may be held liable if it inno\ncently takes into account adverse information provided,\nnot by a supervisor, but by a low-level employee, see ante,\nat 10–11, n. 4, the Court increases the confusion that its\ndecision is likely to produce.\n   For these reasons, I cannot accept the Court’s interpre\ntation of §4311(c)(1), but I nevertheless agree that the\ndecision below must be reversed. There was sufficient\nevidence to support a finding that at least Korenchuk was\nactually delegated part of the decisionmaking authority in\nthis case. Korenchuk was the head of the unit in which\nStaub worked and it was Korenchuk who told Buck that\n4                  STAUB v. PROCTOR HOSPITAL\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nStaub left his work area without informing his supervi\nsors. There was evidence that Korenchuk’s accusation\nformed the basis of Buck’s decision to fire Staub, and that\nBuck simply accepted the accusation at face value. Ac\ncording to one version of events, Buck fired Staub immedi\nately after Korenchuk informed her of Staub’s alleged\nmisconduct, and she cited only that misconduct in the\ntermination notice provided to Staub. See 5 Record 128–\n129, 267–268, 380–386; App. 74a. All of this is enough to\nshow that Korenchuk was in effect delegated some of\nBuck’s termination authority. There was also evidence\nfrom which it may be inferred that displeasure with\nStaub’s Reserve responsibilities was a motivating factor in\nKorenchuk’s actions.*\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   * See 5 Record 343–344 (testimony that Korenchuk made negative\nremarks about Staub’s Reserve duties before firing him in 1998); id., at\n124–126, 352 (testimony that Korenchuk informed Staub of the revenue\nlost while he was on Active Duty in 2003, that Korenchuk was aware in\nJanuary 2004 that Staub might be called to Active Duty again, and that\n“[b]udget was a big issue with [Korenchuk]”).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/205713/", "sha1": "f138b8c0fca5f97549b36c42631dfb3c86bc124e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-03-01T07:06:56"}
