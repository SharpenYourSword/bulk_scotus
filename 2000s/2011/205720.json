Argued January 19, 2011\u2014Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make re\n  cords and documents publicly available upon request, subject to sev\n  eral statutory exemptions. One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C),\n  covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which \u201ccould rea\n  sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of per\n  sonal privacy.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). CompTel, a trade associa\n  tion, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&T had provided to\n  the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau dur\n  ing an investigation of that company. The Bureau found that Ex\n  emption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&T\u2019s submissions\n  but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not\n  have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d interests as required by the exemption. The\n  FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third\n  Circuit did not. It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \u201cpersonal\n  privacy\u201d of corporations, reasoning that \u201cpersonal\u201d is the adjective\n  form of the term \u201cperson,\u201d which Congress has defined, as applicable\n  here, to include corporations, \u00a7551(2).\nHeld: Corporations do not have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d for the purposes of\n Exemption 7(C). Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) AT&T argues that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in Exemption 7(C) incor\n porates the statutory definition of \u201cperson,\u201d which includes corpora\n tions, \u00a7551(2). But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of\n corresponding nouns. \u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute; \u201cper\n sonal\u201d is not. When a statute does not define a term, the Court typi\n cally \u201cgive[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201d Johnson v. United\n States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. \u201cPersonal\u201d ordinarily refers to individuals.\n People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or\n2                            FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspon\n    dence of corporations. In fact, \u201cpersonal\u201d is often used to mean pre\n    cisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\n    and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion\n    and a company\u2019s view. Dictionary definitions also suggest that \u201cper\n    sonal\u201d does not ordinarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d like corpora\n    tions.\n       AT&T contends that its reading of \u201cpersonal\u201d is supported by the\n    common legal usage of the word \u201cperson.\u201d Yet while \u201cperson,\u201d in a le\n    gal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&T\u2019s effort to ascribe\n    a corresponding legal meaning to \u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the differ\n    ence between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpersonal.\u201d AT&T provides scant support\n    for the proposition that \u201cpersonal\u201d denotes corporations, even in a le\n    gal context.\n       Regardless of whether \u201cpersonal\u201d can carry a legal meaning apart\n    from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed \u201cin\n    light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.\n    Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d but to the term\n    \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d \u201cPersonal\u201d in that phrase conveys more than just\n    \u201cof a person\u201d; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human con\n    cerns\u2014not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&T.\n    AT&T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly\n    referred to a corporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify\n    any other statute that does so. While AT&T argues that this Court\n    has recognized \u201cprivacy\u201d interests of corporations in the Fourth\n    Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for\n    the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d interests as\n    a matter of constitutional or common law. AT&T contends that the\n    FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d neces\n    sarily excludes corporations\u2019 privacy. But construing statutory lan\n    guage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer limits of [a\n    word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n    481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory\n    text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\n    Pp. 3\u20139.\n       (b) The meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) is further\n    clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions. Exemption 6, which\n    Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers \u201cperson\n    nel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would\n    constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n    \u00a7552(b)(6). This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as in\n    volving an \u201cindividual\u2019s right of privacy,\u201d Department of State v. Ray,\n    502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same\n    phrase\u2014\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\u2014used in Exemption 6. In contrast, FOIA\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Congress did not use\n  any language similar to that in Exemption 4 in Exemption 7(C).\n  Pp. 9\u201311.\n582 F. 3d 490, reversed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

AT&T INC. ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                [March 1, 2011]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agen\ncies to make records and documents publicly available\nupon request, unless they fall within one of several statu\ntory exemptions. One of those exemptions covers law\nenforcement records, the disclosure of which \u201ccould rea\nsonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). The ques\ntion presented is whether corporations have \u201cpersonal\nprivacy\u201d for the purposes of this exemption.\n                             I\n  The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this\ncase relates to an investigation of respondent AT&T Inc.,\nconducted by the Federal Communications Commission.\nAT&T participated in an FCC-administered program\u2014the\nE-Rate (or Education-Rate) program\u2014that was created to\nenhance access for schools and libraries to advanced tele\ncommunications and information services. In August\n2004, AT&T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might\n2                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave overcharged the Government for services it provided\nas part of the program.\n   The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau launched an investiga\ntion. As part of that investigation, AT&T provided the\nBureau various documents, including responses to inter\nrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor\nmation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,\nand AT&T\u2019s assessment of whether those employees had\nviolated the company\u2019s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,\n492\u2013493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&T resolved the\nmatter in December 2004 through a consent decree in\nwhich AT&T\u2014without conceding liability\u2014agreed to pay\nthe Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure\ncompliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,\n24016\u201324019.\n   Several months later, CompTel\u2014\u201ca trade association\nrepresenting some of AT&T\u2019s competitors\u201d\u2014submitted a\nFOIA request seeking \u201c \u2018[a]ll pleadings and correspon\ndence\u2019 \u201d in the Bureau\u2019s file on the AT&T investigation.\n582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel\u2019s request, and\nthe Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.\n   The Bureau concluded that some of the information\nAT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,\nbilling-related information, and identifying information\nabout staff, contractors, and customer representatives)\nshould be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp\ntion 4, which relates to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(4). App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a\u201341a. The Bureau also decided to withhold\nother information under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Exemp\ntion 7(C) exempts \u201crecords or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes\u201d that \u201ccould reasonably be expected\nto constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri\nvacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that \u201cindi\nviduals identified in [AT&T\u2019s] submissions\u201d have \u201cprivacy\nrights\u201d that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that\nexemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that \u201cbusi\nnesses do not possess \u2018personal privacy\u2019 interests as re\nquired\u201d by the exemption. Id., at 42a\u201343a.\n   On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com\nmission found AT&T\u2019s position that it is \u201ca \u2018private corpo\nrate citizen\u2019 with personal privacy rights that should be\nprotected from disclosure that would \u2018embarrass\u2019 it . . .\nwithin the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with\nestablished [FCC] and judicial precedent.\u201d 23 FCC Rcd.\n13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that \u201cExemp\ntion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as\n[AT&T].\u201d Id., at 13710.\n   AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC\u2019s reasoning.\nNoting that Congress had defined the word \u201cperson\u201d to\ninclude corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the\n\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d of corporations, since \u201cthe root from\nwhich the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived\u201d is the\ndefined term \u201cperson.\u201d 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court\nexplained, \u201c[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival\nform of a defined term not to refer back to that defined\nterm.\u201d Ibid. The court accordingly ruled \u201cthat FOIA\u2019s text\nunambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a\n\u2018personal privacy\u2019 interest within the meaning of Exemp\ntion 7(C).\u201d Id., at 498.\n   The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third\nCircuit\u2019s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent\nsupporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), and now reverse.\n                            II\n  Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&T relies on the\nargument that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in Exemption 7(C)\nincorporates the statutory definition of the word \u201cperson.\u201d\n4                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Brief for Respondent AT&T 8\u20139, 14\u201315 (AT&T Brief);\n582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act\ndefines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201can individual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or public or private organization\nother than an agency.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551(2). Because that\ndefinition applies here, the argument goes, \u201cpersonal\u201d\nmust mean relating to those \u201cperson[s]\u201d: namely, corpora\ntions and other entities as well as individuals. This read\ning, we are told, is dictated by a \u201cbasic principle of gram\nmar and usage.\u201d AT&T Brief 8; see id., at 14\u201315; see also\n582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.\nDiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con\ncurring), for \u201c[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]\u201d that \u201ca\nstatute which defines a noun has thereby defined the\nadjectival form of that noun\u201d). According to AT&T, \u201c[b]y\nexpressly defining the noun \u2018person\u2019 to include corpora\ntions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form\nof that noun\u2014\u2018personal\u2019\u2014also to include corporations.\u201d\nAT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).\n   We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of\ncorresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they\nacquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun \u201ccrab\u201d\nrefers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while\nthe related adjective \u201ccrabbed\u201d can refer to handwriting\nthat is \u201cdifficult to read,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 527 (2002); \u201ccorny\u201d can mean \u201cusing\nfamiliar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to\nthe unsophisticated,\u201d id., at 509, which has little to do\nwith \u201ccorn,\u201d id., at 507 (\u201cthe seeds of any of the cereal\ngrasses used for food\u201d); and while \u201ccrank\u201d is \u201ca part of an\naxis bent at right angles,\u201d \u201ccranky\u201d can mean \u201cgiven to\nfretful fussiness,\u201d id., at 530.\n   Even in cases such as these there may well be a link\nbetween the noun and the adjective. \u201cCranky\u201d describes a\nperson with a \u201cwayward\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d temper, see 3\nOxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED),\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked\nangular shape from which a \u201ccrank\u201d takes its name. That\nis not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary\nusage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings\nas disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC\u2019s\nargument that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not, in fact, derive from the\nEnglish word \u201cperson,\u201d but instead developed along its\nown etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, sim\nply highlights the shortcomings of AT&T\u2019s proposed rule.\n   \u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute; \u201cpersonal\u201d is\nnot. When a statute does not define a term, we typically\n\u201cgive the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201d Johnson v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4). \u201cPersonal\u201d\nordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak\nof personal characteristics, personal effects, personal\ncorrespondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as\nreferring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is\nnot to say that corporations do not have correspondence,\ninfluence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not\nuse the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to describe them.\n   Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation\napproached the chief financial officer and said, \u201cI have\nsomething personal to tell you,\u201d we would not assume the\nCEO was about to discuss company business. Responding\nto a request for information, an individual might say,\n\u201cthat\u2019s personal.\u201d A company spokesman, when asked for\ninformation about the company, would not. In fact, we\noften use the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to mean precisely the oppo\nsite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\nand business expenses, personal life and work life, per\nsonal opinion and a company\u2019s view.\n   Dictionaries also suggest that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not ordi\nnarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d such as corporations.\nSee, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (\u201c[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the\nindividual person or self,\u201d \u201cindividual; private; one\u2019s own,\u201d\n\u201c[3] [o]f or pertaining to one\u2019s person, body, or figure,\u201d \u201c[5]\n6                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self\nconscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction\u201d); 11\nOED at 599\u2013600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (\u201c[3] relating to\nthe person or body\u201d; \u201c[4] relating to an individual, his\ncharacter, conduct, motives, or private affairs\u201d; \u201c[5] relat\ning to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from\nthings\u201d); ibid. (2002) (same).\n   AT&T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that\n\u201cpersonal\u201d\u2014at its most basic level\u2014simply means \u201c[o]f or\npertaining to a particular person.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company\nacknowledges that \u201cin non-legal usage, where a \u2018person\u2019 is\na human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word\n\u2018personal\u2019 is used to refer to human beings.\u201d AT&T Brief\n8. But in a watered-down version of the \u201cgrammatical\nimperative\u201d argument, AT&T contends that \u201cperson\u201d\u2014in\ncommon legal usage\u2014is understood to include a corpora\ntion. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the same context therefore can and\nshould have the same scope, especially here in light of the\nstatutory definition. See id., at 8\u20139, 16.\n   The construction of statutory language often turns on\ncontext, see, e.g., Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5),\nwhich certainly may include the definitions of related\nwords. But here the context to which AT&T points does\nnot dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of \u201cpersonal.\u201d\nWe have no doubt that \u201cperson,\u201d in a legal setting, often\nrefers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that\nclear. 1 U. S. C. \u00a71 (defining \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201ccorpora\ntions, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, socie\nties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals\u201d).\nBut AT&T\u2019s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal mean\ning to \u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the difference between \u201cper\nson\u201d and \u201cpersonal.\u201d\n   When it comes to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d there is little\nsupport for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are \u201cpro\ntected by the doctrine of \u2018personal\u2019 jurisdiction,\u201d AT&T\nBrief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per\nsonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction \u201cof a\nperson.\u201d The only other example AT&T cites is an 1896\ncase that referred to the \u201c \u2018personal privilege\u2019 \u201d of a corpora\ntion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.\nMemphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).\nThese examples fall far short of establishing that \u201cper\nsonal\u201d here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary\none, even if \u201cperson\u201d does. Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2010) (slip op., at 8\u201310) (noting\nthat \u201c \u2018discovery\u2019 is often used as a term of art in connec\ntion with the \u2018discovery rule\u2019 \u201d and describing the judicial\nand legislative codification of that meaning over time);\nMolzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 306 (1992) (\u201c \u2018Puni\ntive damages\u2019 is a legal term of art that has a widely\naccepted common-law meaning . . . this Court\u2019s decisions\nmake clear that the concept . . . has a long pedigree in the\nlaw\u201d).\n   Regardless of whether \u201cpersonal\u201d can carry a special\nmeaning in legal usage, \u201cwhen interpreting a statute . . .\nwe construe language . . . in light of the terms surrounding\nit.\u201d Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004). Exemption\n7(C) refers not just to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d but to the term\n\u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(C); cf. Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U. S. 653, 657 (1998) (\u201cIt is not the meaning\nof \u2018for\u2019 we are seeking here, but the meaning of \u2018[s]uits for\nviolation of contracts\u2019 \u201d). AT&T\u2019s effort to attribute a\nspecial legal meaning to the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in this par\nticular context is wholly unpersuasive.\n   AT&T\u2019s argument treats the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d as\nsimply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.\nUnder that view, the defined meaning of the noun \u201cper\nson,\u201d or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on\n8                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater significance. But two words together may assume\na more particular meaning than those words in isolation.\nWe understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resem\nbling gold. A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who\nis charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is\none not to be missed. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the phrase \u201cpersonal\nprivacy\u201d conveys more than just \u201cof a person.\u201d It suggests\na type of privacy evocative of human concerns\u2014not the\nsort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&T.\n   Despite its contention that \u201c[c]ommon legal usage\u201d of the\nword \u201cperson\u201d supports its reading of the term \u201cpersonal\nprivacy,\u201d AT&T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&T does not cite a\nsingle instance in which this Court or any other (aside\nfrom the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to\na corporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify any\nother statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the\ncontrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress\ndrafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding\nthat the specific concept of \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d at least as a\nmatter of common law, did not apply to corporations. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7652I, Comment c (1976)\n(\u201cA corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nhas no personal right of privacy\u201d); W. Prosser, Law of\nTorts \u00a797, pp. 641\u2013642 (2d ed. 1955) (\u201cA corporation or a\npartnership as such can have no personal privacy, al\nthough it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right\nto its name and its business prestige\u201d (footnotes omitted));\ncf. id., \u00a7112, at 843\u2013844 (3d ed. 1964) (\u201cIt seems to be\ngenerally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining\nonly to individuals, and that a corporation or a partner\nship cannot claim it as such\u201d (footnotes omitted)); id.,\n\u00a7117, at 815 (4th ed. 1971) (same).\n   AT&T contends that this Court has recognized \u201cprivacy\u201d\ninterests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and\ndouble jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be\nsimilarly construed here. See AT&T Brief 20\u201325. But this\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase does not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corpo\nration\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d interests as a matter of constitutional or\ncommon law. The discrete question before us is instead\nwhether Congress used the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d to\nrefer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemp\ntion 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too far afield to be of\nhelp here.\n   AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to\ndemonstrate that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d \u201cnecessar\nily excludes the privacy of corporations.\u201d Id., at 31\u201332\n(emphasis added). But construing statutory language is\nnot merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer limits of\n[a word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Ser\nvice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006). AT&T has given us no\nsound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard\nthe ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d\n                               III\n   The meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) is\nfurther clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en\nacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing\nFOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp\ntion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this\ncontext. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6) (\u201cstatutory interpretation turns on \u2018the language\nitself, the specific context in which that language is used,\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole\u2019 \u201d (quot\ning Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).\nTwo of those other exemptions are particularly relevant\nhere.\n   The phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d first appeared in the\nFOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight\nyears before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80\nStat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(6).\nExemption 6 covers \u201cpersonnel and medical files and\nsimilar files the disclosure of which would constitute\n10                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in\ndrafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly\nidentical manner.\n   Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited\nto individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu\nlarly referred to that exemption as involving an \u201cindivid\nual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d Department of State v. Ray, 502\nU. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post\nCo., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).\n   AT&T does not dispute that \u201cidentical words and\nphrases within the same statute should normally be given\nthe same meaning,\u201d Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy\nServices, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that\n\u201cif Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because\n[it] applies only to \u2018personnel and medical files and similar\nfiles,\u2019 \u201d not because of the term \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d AT&T\nBrief 36 (quoting \u00a7552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the\npertinent phrase\u2014\u201cthe disclosure of which would consti\ntute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(6)\u2014cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,\nExemption 6 would categorically exempt \u201cpersonnel and\nmedical files\u201d as well as any \u201csimilar\u201d file. Even if the\nscope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it\nprotects, the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d phrase importantly de\nfines the particular subset of that information Congress\nsought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.\nAnd because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption\n7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent\nin construing Exemption 7(C).\n   In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the\nother hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.\nExemption 4 pertains to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information obtained from a person and privi\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleged or confidential.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(4). This clearly\napplies to corporations\u2014it uses the defined term \u201cperson\u201d\nto describe the source of the information\u2014and we far more\nreadily think of corporations as having \u201cprivileged or\nconfidential\u201d documents than personally private ones. So\nat the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in\nplace an exemption that plainly covered a corporation\u2019s\ncommercial and financial information, and another that\nwe have described as relating to \u201cindividuals.\u201d The lan\nguage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.\n  The Government has long interpreted the phrase \u201cper\nsonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly\nafter Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted\nExemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran\ndum to executive departments and agencies explaining\nthat \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in that exemption \u201cpertains to the\nprivacy interests of individuals.\u201d U. S. Dept. of Justice,\nAttorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend\nments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in\nHouse Committee on Government Operations and Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act\nand Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93\u2013502), 94th Cong., 1st\nSess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,\nthe Attorney General noted, \u201cdoes not seem applicable to\ncorporations or other entities.\u201d Ibid. We have previously\nviewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret\ning FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456\nU.

Argued January 19, 2011\u2014Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make re\n  cords and documents publicly available upon request, subject to sev\n  eral statutory exemptions. One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C),\n  covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which \u201ccould rea\n  sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of per\n  sonal privacy.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). CompTel, a trade associa\n  tion, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&T had provided to\n  the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau dur\n  ing an investigation of that company. The Bureau found that Ex\n  emption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&T\u2019s submissions\n  but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not\n  have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d interests as required by the exemption. The\n  FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third\n  Circuit did not. It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \u201cpersonal\n  privacy\u201d of corporations, reasoning that \u201cpersonal\u201d is the adjective\n  form of the term \u201cperson,\u201d which Congress has defined, as applicable\n  here, to include corporations, \u00a7551(2).\nHeld: Corporations do not have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d for the purposes of\n Exemption 7(C). Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) AT&T argues that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in Exemption 7(C) incor\n porates the statutory definition of \u201cperson,\u201d which includes corpora\n tions, \u00a7551(2). But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of\n corresponding nouns. \u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute; \u201cper\n sonal\u201d is not. When a statute does not define a term, the Court typi\n cally \u201cgive[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201d Johnson v. United\n States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. \u201cPersonal\u201d ordinarily refers to individuals.\n People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or\n2                            FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspon\n    dence of corporations. In fact, \u201cpersonal\u201d is often used to mean pre\n    cisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\n    and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion\n    and a company\u2019s view. Dictionary definitions also suggest that \u201cper\n    sonal\u201d does not ordinarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d like corpora\n    tions.\n       AT&T contends that its reading of \u201cpersonal\u201d is supported by the\n    common legal usage of the word \u201cperson.\u201d Yet while \u201cperson,\u201d in a le\n    gal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&T\u2019s effort to ascribe\n    a corresponding legal meaning to \u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the differ\n    ence between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpersonal.\u201d AT&T provides scant support\n    for the proposition that \u201cpersonal\u201d denotes corporations, even in a le\n    gal context.\n       Regardless of whether \u201cpersonal\u201d can carry a legal meaning apart\n    from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed \u201cin\n    light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.\n    Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d but to the term\n    \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d \u201cPersonal\u201d in that phrase conveys more than just\n    \u201cof a person\u201d; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human con\n    cerns\u2014not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&T.\n    AT&T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly\n    referred to a corporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify\n    any other statute that does so. While AT&T argues that this Court\n    has recognized \u201cprivacy\u201d interests of corporations in the Fourth\n    Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for\n    the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d interests as\n    a matter of constitutional or common law. AT&T contends that the\n    FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d neces\n    sarily excludes corporations\u2019 privacy. But construing statutory lan\n    guage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer limits of [a\n    word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n    481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory\n    text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\n    Pp. 3\u20139.\n       (b) The meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) is further\n    clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions. Exemption 6, which\n    Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers \u201cperson\n    nel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would\n    constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n    \u00a7552(b)(6). This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as in\n    volving an \u201cindividual\u2019s right of privacy,\u201d Department of State v. Ray,\n    502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same\n    phrase\u2014\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d\u2014used in Exemption 6. In contrast, FOIA\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

One of those exemptions covers law\nenforcement records, the disclosure of which \u201ccould rea\nsonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.\u201d 5 U. S.

The ques\ntion presented is whether corporations have \u201cpersonal\nprivacy\u201d for the purposes of this exemption.\n                             I\n  The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this\ncase relates to an investigation of respondent AT&T Inc.,\nconducted by the Federal Communications Commission.\nAT&T participated in an FCC-administered program\u2014the\nE-Rate (or Education-Rate) program\u2014that was created to\nenhance access for schools and libraries to advanced tele\ncommunications and information services.

As part of that investigation, AT&T provided the\nBureau various documents, including responses to inter\nrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor\nmation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,\nand AT&T\u2019s assessment of whether those employees had\nviolated the company\u2019s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,\n492\u2013493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&T resolved the\nmatter in December 2004 through a consent decree in\nwhich AT&T\u2014without conceding liability\u2014agreed to pay\nthe Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure\ncompliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,\n24016\u201324019.\n   Several months later, CompTel\u2014\u201ca trade association\nrepresenting some of AT&T\u2019s competitors\u201d\u2014submitted a\nFOIA request seeking \u201c \u2018[a]ll pleadings and correspon\ndence\u2019 \u201d in the Bureau\u2019s file on the AT&T investigation.\n582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel\u2019s request, and\nthe Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.\n   The Bureau concluded that some of the information\nAT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,\nbilling-related information, and identifying information\nabout staff, contractors, and customer representatives)\nshould be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp\ntion 4, which relates to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(4). App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a\u201341a. The Bureau also decided to withhold\nother information under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Exemp\ntion 7(C) exempts \u201crecords or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes\u201d that \u201ccould reasonably be expected\nto constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri\nvacy.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that \u201cindi\nviduals identified in [AT&T\u2019s] submissions\u201d have \u201cprivacy\nrights\u201d that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that\nexemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that \u201cbusi\nnesses do not possess \u2018personal privacy\u2019 interests as re\nquired\u201d by the exemption. Id., at 42a\u201343a.\n   On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com\nmission found AT&T\u2019s position that it is \u201ca \u2018private corpo\nrate citizen\u2019 with personal privacy rights that should be\nprotected from disclosure that would \u2018embarrass\u2019 it . . .\nwithin the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with\nestablished [FCC] and judicial precedent.\u201d 23 FCC Rcd.\n13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that \u201cExemp\ntion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as\n[AT&T].\u201d Id., at 13710.\n   AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC\u2019s reasoning.\nNoting that Congress had defined the word \u201cperson\u201d to\ninclude corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the\n\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d of corporations, since \u201cthe root from\nwhich the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived\u201d is the\ndefined term \u201cperson.\u201d 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court\nexplained, \u201c[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival\nform of a defined term not to refer back to that defined\nterm.\u201d Ibid. The court accordingly ruled \u201cthat FOIA\u2019s text\nunambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a\n\u2018personal privacy\u2019 interest within the meaning of Exemp\ntion 7(C).\u201d Id., at 498.\n   The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third\nCircuit\u2019s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent\nsupporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), and now reverse.\n                            II\n  Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&T relies on the\nargument that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in Exemption 7(C)\nincorporates the statutory definition of the word \u201cperson.\u201d\n4                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Brief for Respondent AT&T 8\u20139, 14\u201315 (AT&T Brief);\n582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act\ndefines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201can individual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or public or private organization\nother than an agency.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551(2). Because that\ndefinition applies here, the argument goes, \u201cpersonal\u201d\nmust mean relating to those \u201cperson[s]\u201d: namely, corpora\ntions and other entities as well as individuals. This read\ning, we are told, is dictated by a \u201cbasic principle of gram\nmar and usage.\u201d AT&T Brief 8; see id., at 14\u201315; see also\n582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.\nDiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con\ncurring), for \u201c[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]\u201d that \u201ca\nstatute which defines a noun has thereby defined the\nadjectival form of that noun\u201d). According to AT&T, \u201c[b]y\nexpressly defining the noun \u2018person\u2019 to include corpora\ntions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form\nof that noun\u2014\u2018personal\u2019\u2014also to include corporations.\u201d\nAT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).\n   We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of\ncorresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they\nacquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun \u201ccrab\u201d\nrefers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while\nthe related adjective \u201ccrabbed\u201d can refer to handwriting\nthat is \u201cdifficult to read,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 527 (2002); \u201ccorny\u201d can mean \u201cusing\nfamiliar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to\nthe unsophisticated,\u201d id., at 509, which has little to do\nwith \u201ccorn,\u201d id., at 507 (\u201cthe seeds of any of the cereal\ngrasses used for food\u201d); and while \u201ccrank\u201d is \u201ca part of an\naxis bent at right angles,\u201d \u201ccranky\u201d can mean \u201cgiven to\nfretful fussiness,\u201d id., at 530.\n   Even in cases such as these there may well be a link\nbetween the noun and the adjective. \u201cCranky\u201d describes a\nperson with a \u201cwayward\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d temper, see 3\nOxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED),\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

That\nis not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary\nusage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings\nas disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC\u2019s\nargument that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not, in fact, derive from the\nEnglish word \u201cperson,\u201d but instead developed along its\nown etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, sim\nply highlights the shortcomings of AT&T\u2019s proposed rule.\n   \u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute; \u201cpersonal\u201d is\nnot. When a statute does not define a term, we typically\n\u201cgive the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201d Johnson v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4). \u201cPersonal\u201d\nordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak\nof personal characteristics, personal effects, personal\ncorrespondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as\nreferring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is\nnot to say that corporations do not have correspondence,\ninfluence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not\nuse the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to describe them.\n   Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation\napproached the chief financial officer and said, \u201cI have\nsomething personal to tell you,\u201d we would not assume the\nCEO was about to discuss company business. Responding\nto a request for information, an individual might say,\n\u201cthat\u2019s personal.\u201d A company spokesman, when asked for\ninformation about the company, would not. In fact, we\noften use the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to mean precisely the oppo\nsite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\nand business expenses, personal life and work life, per\nsonal opinion and a company\u2019s view.\n   Dictionaries also suggest that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not ordi\nnarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d such as corporations.\nSee, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (\u201c[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the\nindividual person or self,\u201d \u201cindividual; private; one\u2019s own,\u201d\n\u201c[3] [o]f or pertaining to one\u2019s person, body, or figure,\u201d \u201c[5]\n6                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self\nconscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction\u201d); 11\nOED at 599\u2013600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (\u201c[3] relating to\nthe person or body\u201d; \u201c[4] relating to an individual, his\ncharacter, conduct, motives, or private affairs\u201d; \u201c[5] relat\ning to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from\nthings\u201d); ibid. (2002) (same).\n   AT&T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that\n\u201cpersonal\u201d\u2014at its most basic level\u2014simply means \u201c[o]f or\npertaining to a particular person.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company\nacknowledges that \u201cin non-legal usage, where a \u2018person\u2019 is\na human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word\n\u2018personal\u2019 is used to refer to human beings.\u201d AT&T Brief\n8. But in a watered-down version of the \u201cgrammatical\nimperative\u201d argument, AT&T contends that \u201cperson\u201d\u2014in\ncommon legal usage\u2014is understood to include a corpora\ntion. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the same context therefore can and\nshould have the same scope, especially here in light of the\nstatutory definition. See id., at 8\u20139, 16.\n   The construction of statutory language often turns on\ncontext, see, e.g., Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5),\nwhich certainly may include the definitions of related\nwords. But here the context to which AT&T points does\nnot dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of \u201cpersonal.\u201d\nWe have no doubt that \u201cperson,\u201d in a legal setting, often\nrefers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that\nclear. 1 U. S. C. \u00a71 (defining \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201ccorpora\ntions, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, socie\nties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals\u201d).\nBut AT&T\u2019s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal mean\ning to \u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the difference between \u201cper\nson\u201d and \u201cpersonal.\u201d\n   When it comes to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d there is little\nsupport for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are \u201cpro\ntected by the doctrine of \u2018personal\u2019 jurisdiction,\u201d AT&T\nBrief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per\nsonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction \u201cof a\nperson.\u201d The only other example AT&T cites is an 1896\ncase that referred to the \u201c \u2018personal privilege\u2019 \u201d of a corpora\ntion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.\nMemphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).\nThese examples fall far short of establishing that \u201cper\nsonal\u201d here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary\none, even if \u201cperson\u201d does. Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U.

Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U.

AT&T\u2019s effort to attribute a\nspecial legal meaning to the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in this par\nticular context is wholly unpersuasive.\n   AT&T\u2019s argument treats the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d as\nsimply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.\nUnder that view, the defined meaning of the noun \u201cper\nson,\u201d or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on\n8                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater significance. But two words together may assume\na more particular meaning than those words in isolation.\nWe understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resem\nbling gold. A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who\nis charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is\none not to be missed. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the phrase \u201cpersonal\nprivacy\u201d conveys more than just \u201cof a person.\u201d It suggests\na type of privacy evocative of human concerns\u2014not the\nsort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&T.\n   Despite its contention that \u201c[c]ommon legal usage\u201d of the\nword \u201cperson\u201d supports its reading of the term \u201cpersonal\nprivacy,\u201d AT&T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&T does not cite a\nsingle instance in which this Court or any other (aside\nfrom the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to\na corporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify any\nother statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the\ncontrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress\ndrafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding\nthat the specific concept of \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d at least as a\nmatter of common law, did not apply to corporations. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7652I, Comment c (1976)\n(\u201cA corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nhas no personal right of privacy\u201d); W. Prosser, Law of\nTorts \u00a797, pp. 641\u2013642 (2d ed. 1955) (\u201cA corporation or a\npartnership as such can have no personal privacy, al\nthough it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right\nto its name and its business prestige\u201d (footnotes omitted));\ncf. id., \u00a7112, at 843\u2013844 (3d ed. 1964) (\u201cIt seems to be\ngenerally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining\nonly to individuals, and that a corporation or a partner\nship cannot claim it as such\u201d (footnotes omitted)); id.,\n\u00a7117, at 815 (4th ed. 1971) (same).\n   AT&T contends that this Court has recognized \u201cprivacy\u201d\ninterests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and\ndouble jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be\nsimilarly construed here. See AT&T Brief 20\u201325. But this\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The discrete question before us is instead\nwhether Congress used the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d to\nrefer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemp\ntion 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too far afield to be of\nhelp here.\n   AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to\ndemonstrate that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d \u201cnecessar\nily excludes the privacy of corporations.\u201d Id., at 31\u201332\n(emphasis added). But construing statutory language is\nnot merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer limits of\n[a word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Ser\nvice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006). AT&T has given us no\nsound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard\nthe ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d\n                               III\n   The meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) is\nfurther clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en\nacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing\nFOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp\ntion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this\ncontext. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6) (\u201cstatutory interpretation turns on \u2018the language\nitself, the specific context in which that language is used,\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole\u2019 \u201d (quot\ning Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).\nTwo of those other exemptions are particularly relevant\nhere.\n   The phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d first appeared in the\nFOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight\nyears before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80\nStat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(b)(6).\nExemption 6 covers \u201cpersonnel and medical files and\nsimilar files the disclosure of which would constitute\n10                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in\ndrafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly\nidentical manner.\n   Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited\nto individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu\nlarly referred to that exemption as involving an \u201cindivid\nual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d Department of State v. Ray, 502\nU. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post\nCo., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).\n   AT&T does not dispute that \u201cidentical words and\nphrases within the same statute should normally be given\nthe same meaning,\u201d Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy\nServices, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that\n\u201cif Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because\n[it] applies only to \u2018personnel and medical files and similar\nfiles,\u2019 \u201d not because of the term \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d AT&T\nBrief 36 (quoting \u00a7552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the\npertinent phrase\u2014\u201cthe disclosure of which would consti\ntute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d\n\u00a7552(b)(6)\u2014cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,\nExemption 6 would categorically exempt \u201cpersonnel and\nmedical files\u201d as well as any \u201csimilar\u201d file. Even if the\nscope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it\nprotects, the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d phrase importantly de\nfines the particular subset of that information Congress\nsought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.\nAnd because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption\n7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent\nin construing Exemption 7(C).\n   In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the\nother hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.\nExemption 4 pertains to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information obtained from a person and privi\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

This clearly\napplies to corporations\u2014it uses the defined term \u201cperson\u201d\nto describe the source of the information\u2014and we far more\nreadily think of corporations as having \u201cprivileged or\nconfidential\u201d documents than personally private ones. So\nat the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in\nplace an exemption that plainly covered a corporation\u2019s\ncommercial and financial information, and another that\nwe have described as relating to \u201cindividuals.\u201d The lan\nguage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.\n  The Government has long interpreted the phrase \u201cper\nsonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly\nafter Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted\nExemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran\ndum to executive departments and agencies explaining\nthat \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in that exemption \u201cpertains to the\nprivacy interests of individuals.\u201d U. S. Dept. of Justice,\nAttorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend\nments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in\nHouse Committee on Government Operations and Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act\nand Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93\u2013502), 94th Cong., 1st\nSess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,\nthe Attorney General noted, \u201cdoes not seem applicable to\ncorporations or other entities.\u201d Ibid. We have previously\nviewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret\ning FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456\nU. S. 615, 622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclu\nsion here.\n                       *    *    *\n  We reject the argument that because \u201cperson\u201d is defined\nfor purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase\n\u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations\nas well. The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law\n12                  FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nenforcement information on the ground that it would\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\ndoes not extend to corporations. We trust that AT&T will\nnot take it personally.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
