UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–6822. Argued December 6, 2010—Decided March 2, 2011\nAfter pleading guilty to drug charges, petitioner Pepper was sentenced\n  under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to 24 months’ imprison\n  ment, a nearly 75 percent downward departure from the low end of\n  the Guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance, fol\n  lowed by five years of supervised release. In Pepper I, the Eighth\n  Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of, inter alia,\n  United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220. Pepper, who had begun serv\n  ing his supervised release, testified at his resentencing hearing that\n  he was no longer a drug addict, having completed a 500-hour drug\n  treatment program while in prison; that he was enrolled in commu\n  nity college and had achieved very good grades; and that he was\n  working part time. Pepper’s father testified that he and his son were\n  no longer estranged, and Pepper’s probation officer testified that a\n  24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper’s substan\n  tial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low\n  recidivism risk. The District Court again sentenced Pepper to 24\n  months, granting a 40 percent downward departure based on Pep\n  per’s substantial assistance and a further downward variance based\n  on, inter alia, Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. In\n  Pepper II, the Eighth Circuit again reversed and remanded for resen\n  tencing, concluding that Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation could\n  not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance, and\n  directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge. After\n  this Court vacated and remanded the Pepper II judgment in light of\n  Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, the Eighth Circuit, in Pepper III,\n  reversed and remanded once more. At the second resentencing hear\n  ing, Pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in\n  school, was about to be promoted at his job, and had married and was\n2                     PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    supporting his new family. Noting the nearly identical remand lan\n    guage of Pepper II and Pepper III, the court observed that it was not\n    bound to reduce Pepper’s range by 40 percent for substantial assis\n    tance. Instead, it found him entitled to a 20 percent reduction and\n    refused to grant a further downward variance for, inter alia, postsen\n    tencing rehabilitation. It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12\n    months of supervised release. In Pepper IV, the Eighth Circuit once\n    again rejected Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation argument. It\n    also rejected his claim that the law of the case from Pepper II and\n    Pepper III required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guide\n    lines range by at least 40 percent.\nHeld:\n    1. When a defendant’s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a dis\n trict court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant’s\n postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate\n cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guide\n lines range. Pp. 9–27.\n       (a) Consistent with the principle that “the punishment should fit\n the offender and not merely the crime,” Williams v. New York, 337\n U. S. 241, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform pol\n icy “under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion\n in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determin\n ing the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits\n fixed by law,” id., at 246, particularly “the fullest information possi\n ble concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics,” id., at 247.\n That principle is codified at 18 U. S. C. §3661, which provides that\n “[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information” a sentencing court\n may consider “concerning the [defendant’s] background, character,\n and conduct,” and at §3553(a), which specifies that sentencing courts\n must consider, among other things, a defendant’s “history and char\n acteristics,” §3553(a)(1). The Guidelines, which Booker made “effec\n tively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245, “should be the starting point and\n the initial benchmark,” but district courts may impose sentences\n within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of\n the §3553(a) factors, subject to appellate review for “reasonableness,”\n Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49–51. This sentencing frame\n work applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resen\n tencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal. Pp. 9–12.\n       (b) Postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a down\n ward variance from the advisory Guidelines range. The plain lan\n guage of §3661 makes clear that there is “[n]o limitation . . . on . . .\n background, character, and conduct” information, and it makes no\n distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resen\n tencing. In addition, postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhighly relevant to several §3553(a) factors that district courts are re\nquired to consider at sentencing. The extensive evidence of Pepper’s\nrehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the se\nlection of an appropriate sentence here. Most fundamentally, that\nevidence provides the most up-to-date picture of his “history and\ncharacteristics.” §3553(a)(1). At the time of his initial sentencing, he\nwas an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family\nand sold drugs. By his second resentencing, he had been drug-free\nfor nearly five years, was attending college, was a top employee\nslated for promotion, had re-established a relationship with his fa\nther, and was married and supporting a family. His postsentencing\nconduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in fu\nture criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must\nconsider. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C). Pp. 12–15.\n     (c) The contrary arguments advanced by amicus appointed to de\nfend the judgment are unpersuasive. Pp. 15–26.\n        (1) While §3742(g)(2)—which prohibits a district court at re\nsentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range\nexcept upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing—\neffectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing reha\nbilitation, that provision is invalid after Booker. Like the provisions\ninvalidated in Booker—§§3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)—§3742(g)(2) re\nquires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory\nin an entire set of cases. Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the\nprovision. While applying §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not al\nways result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a par\ntial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively manda\ntory in some cases and advisory in others. The fact that §3742(g)(2)\npermits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines\nsentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure\nupheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional\ninfirmity. And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in\n§3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.\nPp. 15–20.\n        (2) This Court finds unpersuasive amicus’ arguments focusing\non Congress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Contrary to\namicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional pur\npose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evi\ndence. Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Court’s analysis of\nwhether §3553(a) permits consideration of such evidence. Nor is the\nconsideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the\nsentencing factor in §3553(a)(5)—which directs sentencing courts to\nconsider “any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Commis\nsion—particularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is\n4                     PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant\n    sentencing statutes. Consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation\n    is also not inconsistent with §3553(a)(6)—which requires courts to\n    consider “the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities\n    among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n    similar conduct”—as any disparity arises only from the normal trial\n    and sentencing process. The differences in procedural opportunity\n    that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in\n    error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of “unwarranted”\n    sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under\n    §3553(a)(6). Pp. 21–26.\n          (d) On remand, the District Court should consider and give ap\n    propriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence, as\n    well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper’s conduct since his\n    last sentencing. Pp. 26–27.\n       2. Because the Eighth Circuit in Pepper III set aside Pepper’s en\n    tire sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing, the District\n    Court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the\n    same 40 percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.\n    To avoid undermining a district court’s original sentencing intent, an\n    appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence “may vacate\n    the entire sentence . . . so that, on remand, the trial court can recon\n    figure the sentencing plan . . . to satisfy [§3553(a)’s] sentencing fac\n    tors.” Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 253. That is what\n    the Eighth Circuit did here.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 2, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This Court has long recognized that sentencing judges\n“exercise a wide discretion” in the types of evidence they\nmay consider when imposing sentence and that “[h]ighly\nrelevant—if not essential—to [the] selection of an appro\npriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant’s life and characteris\ntics.” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246–247\n(1949). Congress codified this principle at 18 U. S. C.\n§3661, which provides that “[n]o limitation shall be placed\non the information” a sentencing court may consider “con\ncerning the [defendant’s] background, character, and con\nduct,” and at §3553(a), which sets forth certain factors\nthat sentencing courts must consider, including “the his\ntory and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nconcluded in this case that the District Court, when resen\ntencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set\naside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner’s\nrehabilitation since his initial sentencing. That conclusion\nconflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentenc\ning law and Congress’ express directives in §§3661 and\n2                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n3553(a).     Although a separate statutory provision,\n§3742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from\nimposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at\nthe prior sentencing—thus effectively precluding the court\nfrom considering postsentencing rehabilitation for pur\nposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence—that provi\nsion did not survive our holding in United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and we expressly invalidate\nit today.\n   We hold that when a defendant’s sentence has been set\naside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may\nconsider evidence of the defendant’s postsentencing reha\nbilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate\ncases, support a downward variance from the now\nadvisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Sepa\nrately, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ ruling that the law\nof the case doctrine did not require the District Court in\nthis case to apply the same percentage departure from the\nGuidelines range for substantial assistance that had been\napplied at petitioner’s prior sentencing.\n                             I\n  In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested\nand charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or\nmore of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S. C. §846.\nAfter pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing\nbefore then-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Pepper’s\nsentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121\nmonths.1 The Government moved for a downward depar\n——————\n  1 Although the charge to which Pepper pleaded guilty carried a man\n\ndatory minimum of 120 months’ imprisonment, the mandatory mini\nmum did not apply because he was eligible for safety-valve relief\npursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(f) (2000 ed.) and §5C1.2 of the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nture pursuant to USSG §5K1.1 based on Pepper’s substan\ntial assistance and recommended a 15 percent downward\ndeparture.2 The District Court, however, sentenced Pep\nper to a 24-month prison term, resulting in an approxi\nmately 75 percent downward departure from the low end\nof the Guidelines range, to be followed by five years of\nsupervised release. The Government appealed Pepper’s\nsentence, and in June 2005, the Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in\nlight of our intervening decision in Booker (and for another\nreason not relevant here). See United States v. Pepper,\n412 F. 3d 995, 999 (2005) (Pepper I). Pepper completed his\n24-month sentence three days after Pepper I was issued\nand began serving his term of supervised release.\n   In May 2006, the District Court conducted a resentenc\ning hearing and heard from three witnesses. In his testi\nmony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously\nbeen a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour\ndrug treatment program while in prison and he no longer\nused any drugs. App. 104–105. Pepper then explained\nthat since his release from prison, he had enrolled at a\nlocal community college as a full-time student and had\nearned A’s in all of his classes in the prior semester. Id.,\nat 106–107. Pepper also testified that he had obtained\nemployment within a few weeks after being released from\ncustody and was continuing to work part-time while at\ntending school. Id., at 106–110. Pepper confirmed that he\nwas in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised\nrelease and described his changed attitude since his ar\nrest. See id., at 111 (“[M]y life was basically headed to\n——————\n  2 USSG §5K1.1 provides that a court may depart from the Guidelines\n\n“[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has\nprovided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother person who has committed an offense.” Pepper provided\ninformation to Government investigators and a grand jury concerning\ntwo other individuals involved with illegal drugs and guns.\n4                    PEPPER v.

My\nlife was going nowhere before, and I think it’s going some\nwhere now”).\n   Pepper’s father testified that he had virtually no contact\nwith Pepper during the 5-year period leading up to his\narrest. Id., at 117. Pepper’s drug treatment program,\naccording to his father, “truly sobered him up” and “made\nhis way of thinking change.” Id., at 121. He explained\nthat Pepper was now “much more mature” and “serious in\nterms of planning for the future,” id., at 119, and that as a\nconsequence, he had re-established a relationship with his\nson, id., at 118–119.\n   Finally, Pepper’s probation officer testified that, in his\nview, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of\nPepper’s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilita\ntion, and demonstrated low risk of recidivism. Id., at 126–\n131. The probation officer also prepared a sentencing\nmemorandum that further set forth the reasons support\ning his recommendation for a 24-month sentence.\n   The District Court adopted as its findings of fact the\ntestimony of the three witnesses and the probation offi\ncer’s sentencing memorandum. The court granted a 40\npercent downward departure based on Pepper’s substan\ntial assistance, reducing the bottom of the Guidelines\nrange from 97 to 58 months. The court then granted a\nfurther 59 percent downward variance based on, inter alia,\nPepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. Id., at\n143–148.3 The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of\nimprisonment, concluding that “it would [not] advance any\n——————\n  3 The court also cited Pepper’s lack of a violent history and, to a lesser\n\nextent, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity with\nPepper’s co-conspirators.

See United States v. Pepper, 486 F. 3d 408,\n410, 413 (CA8 2007) (Pepper II). The court concluded that,\nwhile it was “a close call, [it could not] say the district\ncourt abused its discretion” by granting the 40 percent\ndownward departure for substantial assistance. Id., at\n411. The court found the further 59 percent downward\nvariance, however, to be an abuse of discretion. Id., at\n412–413. In doing so, the court held that Pepper’s “post\nsentencing rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to\nconsider in granting a downward variance.” Id., at 413.\nThe court stated that evidence of postsentencing reha\nbilitation “ ‘is not relevant and will not be permitted at\nresentencing because the district court could not have\nconsidered that evidence at the time of the original\nsentencing,’ ” and permitting courts to consider post\nsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing “would create\nunwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant\ninequities into the sentencing process.” Ibid.4 The Court\nof Appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different\ndistrict judge for resentencing. Ibid.\n   After the Court of Appeals’ mandate issued, Pepper’s\ncase was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R.\nReade. In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order\non the scope of the remand from Pepper II, stating that\n“[t]he court will not consider itself bound to reduce [Pep\n——————\n  4 The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court “further erred\n\nby considering Pepper’s lack of violent history, which history had\nalready been accounted for in the sentencing Guidelines calculation,\nand by considering sentencing disparity among Pepper’s co-defendants\nwithout adequate foundation and explanation.” Pepper II, 486 F. 3d, at\n413.\n6                PEPPER v.

In\nthe meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of\ncertiorari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition,\nvacated the judgment in Pepper II, and remanded the case\nto the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of\nGall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38 (2007). See Pepper v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 1089 (2008).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals held that Gall did not\nalter its prior conclusion that “post-sentence rehabilitation\nis an impermissible factor to consider in granting a down\nward variance.” 518 F. 3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) (Pepper\nIII). The court again reversed the sentence and remanded\nfor resentencing.\n   In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened Pepper’s\nsecond resentencing hearing. Pepper informed the court\nthat he was still attending school and was now working as\na supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer,\nwhere he was recently selected by management as “associ\nate of the year” and was likely to be promoted the follow\ning January. App. 320, 323. Pepper also stated that he\nhad recently married and was now supporting his wife and\nher daughter. Id., at 321. Pepper’s father reiterated that\nPepper was moving forward in both his career and his\nfamily life and that he remained in close touch with\nhis son. See id., at 300–304.\n   In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentenc\ning memorandum. Noting that the remand language of\nPepper III was nearly identical to the language in Pepper\nII, the court again observed that it was “not bound to\nreduce [Pepper’s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by\n40%” for substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper\nwas entitled only to a 20 percent downward departure\nbecause the assistance was “timely, helpful and impor\ntant” but “in no way extraordinary.” Sealed Sentencing\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

The court also rejected Pepper’s request for\na downward variance based on, inter alia, his postsentenc\ning rehabilitation. Id., at 16.\n   The District Court reconvened Pepper’s resentencing\nhearing in January 2009. The court’s decision to grant a\n20 percent downward departure for substantial assistance\nresulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97\nmonths. The court also granted the Government’s motion\nunder Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure to account for investigative assistance Pepper pro\nvided after he was initially sentenced. The court imposed\na 65-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by 12\nmonths of supervised release.5\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed Pepper’s 65-month sen\ntence. 570 F. 3d 958 (CA8 2009) (Pepper IV). As relevant\nhere, the Court of Appeals rejected Pepper’s argument\nthat the District Court erred in refusing to consider his\npostsentencing rehabilitation. The court acknowledged\nthat “Pepper made significant progress during and follow\ning his initial period of imprisonment” and “commend[ed]\nPepper on the positive changes he has made in his life,”\nbut concluded that Pepper’s argument was foreclosed by\nCircuit precedent holding that “post-sentencing rehabilita\ntion is not a permissible factor to consider in granting a\ndownward variance.” Id., at 964–965 (citing United States\nv. Jenners, 473 F. 3d 894, 899 (CA8 2007); United States v.\nMcMannus, 496 F. 3d 846, 852, n. 4 (CA8 2007)).\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper’s claim that\nthe scope of the remand and the law of the case from\nPepper II and Pepper III required the District Court to\n——————\n  5 After the District Court resentenced Pepper to 65 months’ impris\n\nonment, Pepper was returned to federal custody.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40\npercent pursuant to USSG §5K1.1. The court noted that\nits remand orders in Pepper II and Pepper III were “gen\neral remand[s] for resentencing,” which “did not place any\nlimitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district\ncourt judge in resentencing.” 570 F. 3d, at 963. The court\nfurther noted that, although issues decided by an appel\nlate court become law of the case on remand to the sen\ntencing court, its earlier decisions merely held that a 40\npercent downward departure for substantial assistance\nwas not an abuse of discretion, not that the district court\nwould be bound by the 40 percent departure previously\ngranted. Id., at 963–964.\n   We granted Pepper’s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561\nU. S. ___ (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a\ndistrict court, after a defendant’s sentence has been set\naside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward\nvariance when resentencing the defendant, a question that\nhas divided the Courts of Appeals;6 and (2) whether the\nresentencing court was required, under the law of the case\ndoctrine, to apply the same percentage departure from the\nGuidelines range for substantial assistance that had been\napplied at Pepper’s prior sentencing.

Permitting sentenc\ning courts to consider the widest possible breadth of\ninformation about a defendant “ensures that the punish\nment will suit not merely the offense but the individual\ndefendant.” Wasman v. United States, 468 U. S. 559, 564\n(1984).\n   In 1970, Congress codified the “longstanding principle\nthat sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider\nvarious kinds of information” at 18 U. S. C. §3577 (1970\ned.). United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 151 (1997) (per\ncuriam). Section 3577 (1970 ed.) provided:\n     “No limitation shall be placed on the information con\n     cerning the background, character, and conduct of a\n     person convicted of an offense which a court of the\n     United States may receive and consider for the pur\n     pose of imposing an appropriate sentence.” (Emphasis\n     added.)\nIn the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), 18 U. S. C.\n§3551 et seq., Congress effected fundamental changes to\nfederal sentencing by creating the Federal Sentencing\nCommission and introducing the Guidelines scheme. In\ndoing so, however, Congress recodified §3577 without\nchange at §3661. The Sentencing Commission, moreover,\nexpressly incorporated §3661 in the Guidelines:\n     “In determining the sentence to impose within the\n     guideline range, or whether a departure from the\n     guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, with\n     out limitation, any information concerning the back\n     ground, character and conduct of the defendant,\n     unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U. S. C.\n     §3661.” USSG §1B1.4 (2010) (emphasis added).\nBoth Congress and the Sentencing Commission thus\nexpressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentenc\ning courts to “conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972).8\n   The SRA did constrain sentencing courts’ discretion in\nimportant respects, most notably by making the Guide\nlines mandatory, see 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV), and by specifying various factors that courts\nmust consider in exercising their discretion, see §3553(a).\nIn our seminal decision in Booker, we held that where\nfacts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence\nincreased the applicable Guidelines range, treating the\nGuidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated\nthe Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be\ntried by a jury and to have every element of an offense\nproved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.\n543 U. S., at 243–244. Our remedial opinion in Booker\ninvalidated two offending provisions in the SRA, see id., at\n245 (invalidating 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and\ninstructed the district courts to treat the Guidelines as\n“effectively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245.\n   Our post-Booker opinions make clear that, although a\nsentencing court must “give respectful consideration to the\nGuidelines, Booker permits the court to tailor the sentence\nin light of other statutory concerns as well.” Kimbrough v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 85, 101 (2007) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Accordingly, although the\n“Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial\nbenchmark,” district courts may impose sentences within\nstatutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all\nof the factors listed in §3553(a), subject to appellate review\nfor “reasonableness.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. This\n\n——————\n  8 Of course, sentencing courts’ discretion under §3661 is subject to\nconstitutional constraints. See, e.g., United States v. Leung, 40 F. 3d\n577, 586 (CA2 1994) (“A defendant’s race or nationality may play no\nadverse role in the administration of justice, including at sentencing”).\n12               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsentencing framework applies both at a defendant’s initial\nsentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a\nsentence has been set aside on appeal. See 18 U. S. C.\n§3742(g) (“A district court to which a case is remanded . . .\nshall resentence a defendant in accordance with section\n3553”); see also Dillon v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10) (distinguishing between “sentence\nmodification proceedings” under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2),\nwhich “do not implicate the interests identified in Booker,”\nand “plenary resentencing proceedings,” which do).\n                              B\n  In light of the federal sentencing framework described\nabove, we think it clear that when a defendant’s sentence\nhas been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for\nresentencing, a district court may consider evidence of a\ndefendant’s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and\nthat such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a\ndownward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.\n  Preliminarily, Congress could not have been clearer in\ndirecting that “[n]o limitation . . . be placed on the infor\nmation concerning the background, character, and con\nduct” of a defendant that a district court may “receive and\nconsider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sen\ntence.” 18 U. S. C. §3661. The plain language of §3661\nmakes no distinction between a defendant’s initial sen\ntencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sen\ntence has been set aside on appeal. We have recognized\nthat “the broad language of §3661” does not provide “any\nbasis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against\nconsidering certain types of evidence at sentencing.”\nWatts, 519 U. S., at 152. A categorical bar on the consid\neration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would\ndirectly contravene Congress’ expressed intent in §3661.\n  In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation\nmay be highly relevant to several of the §3553(a) factors\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Congress has expressly instructed district courts to\nconsider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsen\ntencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to “the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant.” §3553(a)(1).\nSuch evidence may also be pertinent to “the need for the\nsentence imposed” to serve the general purposes of sen\ntencing set forth in §3553(a)(2)—in particular, to “afford\nadequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” “protect the\npublic from further crimes of the defendant,” and “provide\nthe defendant with needed educational or vocational train\ning . . . or other correctional treatment in the most ef\nfective manner.” §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(D); see McMannus, 496\nF. 3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (“In assessing . . .\ndeterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18\nU. S. C. §3553(a)(2)(B)(C) & (D), there would seem to be no\nbetter evidence than a defendant’s post-incarceration\nconduct”). Postsentencing rehabilitation may also criti\ncally inform a sentencing judge’s overarching duty under\n§3553(a) to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary” to comply with the sentencing purposes\nset forth in §3553(a)(2).\n  As the original sentencing judge recognized, the exten\nsive evidence of Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial\nsentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appro\npriate sentence in this case. Most fundamentally, evi\ndence of Pepper’s conduct since his release from custody in\nJune 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper’s\n“history and characteristics.” §3553(a)(1); see United\nStates v. Bryson, 229 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (“[A]\ncourt’s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he\nstands before the court on the day of sentencing”). At the\ntime of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25\nyear-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from\nhis family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a\nmethamphetamine conspiracy. By the time of his second\nresentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for\n14               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnearly five years, had attended college and achieved high\ngrades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promo\ntion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and\nwas married and supporting his wife’s daughter. There is\nno question that this evidence of Pepper’s conduct since\nhis initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the\n“history and characteristics” of a defendant that Congress\nintended sentencing courts to consider. §3553(a).\n   Pepper’s postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the\nlikelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a\ncentral factor that district courts must assess when impos\ning sentence. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C); Gall, 552 U. S., at\n59 (“Gall’s self-motivated rehabilitation . . . lends strong\nsupport to the conclusion that imprisonment was not\nnecessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal\nconduct or to protect the public from his future criminal\nacts” (citing §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C))). As recognized by Pep\nper’s probation officer, Pepper’s steady employment, as\nwell as his successful completion of a 500-hour drug\ntreatment program and his drug-free condition, also\nsuggest a diminished need for “educational or vocation-\nal training . . . or other correctional treatment.”\n§3553(a)(2)(D). Finally, Pepper’s exemplary postsentenc\ning conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of\n“his present purposes and tendencies and significantly to\nsuggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline\nthat ought to be imposed upon him.” Ashe, 302 U. S., at\n55. Accordingly, evidence of Pepper’s postsentencing\nrehabilitation bears directly on the District Court’s over\narching duty to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not\ngreater than necessary” to serve the purposes of sentenc\ning. §3553(a).\n   In sum, the Court of Appeals’ ruling prohibiting the\nDistrict Court from considering any evidence of Pepper’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts\nwith longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

S. C.\n§3742(g)(2), which restricts the discretion of a resentenc\ning court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence,\neffectively forecloses consideration of a defendant’s post\nsentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting district\ncourts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would\ndefeat Congress’ objectives under §3553(a). We are not\npersuaded.\n                               1\n  Amicus’ main argument relies on 18 U. S. C. §3742(g)(2),\na provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below.\nThat provision states that when a sentence is set aside on\nappeal, the district court to which the case is remanded:\n    “shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable\n    guidelines range except upon a ground that—\n      “(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in\n    the written statement of reasons required by section\n    3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of\n    the defendant prior to the appeal; and\n      “(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding\n    the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.”\nIn operation, §3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a dis\ntrict court on remand by precluding the court from impos\ning a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a\n“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon in\nthe prior sentencing and upheld on appeal. Amicus thus\ncorrectly contends that, on its face, §3742(g)(2) effectively\nforecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence\nof a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes\nof imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a prac\ntical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the\n16                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprior sentencing. As the Government concedes, however,\n§3742(g)(2) is invalid after Booker.\n  As we have explained, Booker held that where judicial\nfactfinding increases a defendant’s applicable Sentencing\nGuidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in\nthose circumstances would violate the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every\nelement of an offense proved by the Government beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See supra, at 11. We recognized in\nBooker that, although the SRA permitted departures from\nthe applicable Guidelines range in limited circumstances,9\n“departures are not available in every case, and in fact are\nunavailable in most.” 543 U. S., at 234. Because in those\ninstances, “the judge is bound to impose a sentence within\nthe Guidelines range,” we concluded that the availability\nof departures in certain circumstances “does not avoid the\nconstitutional issue.” Ibid.\n  To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the\nGuidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provi\nsions of the SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose\na sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and\n§3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the\nstandard of appellate review, including de novo review of\nGuidelines departures. 543 U. S., at 259. We invalidated\nthese provisions even though we recognized that manda\ntory application of the Guidelines would not always result\nin a Sixth Amendment violation.10 Indeed, although the\n——————\n  9 See 18 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (“The incom\nplete remedy we rejected in Booker would have required\ncourts to treat the Guidelines differently in similar pro\nceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and consid\nerable administrative challenges”).\n   We did not expressly mention §3742(g)(2) in Booker,11\nbut the rationale we set forth in that opinion for invalidat\ning §§3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) applies equally to §3742(g)(2).\nAs with those provisions, §3742(g)(2) requires district\ncourts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in\nan entire set of cases. Specifically, §3742(g)(2) precludes a\ndistrict court on remand from imposing a sentence “out\nside the applicable guidelines range” except upon a\n“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon by\nthe court at the prior sentencing and upheld by the court\nof appeals. In circumstances in which the district court\ndid not rely upon such a departure ground at the prior\nsentencing, §3742(g)(2) would require the court on remand\nto impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines\nrange, thus rendering the Guidelines effectively manda\ntory.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand to apply the Guidelines range, as §3742(g)(2) does,\nwill often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the\nreasons we explained in Booker. Accordingly, as with the\nprovisions in Booker, the proper remedy here is to invali\ndate §3742(g)(2).\n   The sentencing proceeding at issue in Booker itself\nillustrates why §3742(g)(2) cannot withstand Sixth\nAmendment scrutiny. The district court in Booker in\ncreased the defendant’s then-mandatory Guidelines range\nbased on a drug-quantity finding that it, rather than\nthe jury, made. 543 U. S., at 227. After we held that the\nGuidelines must be treated as advisory, we remanded the\ncase for resentencing. Id., at 267. Had §3742(g)(2) re\nmained valid after Booker, the district court on remand\nwould have been required to sentence within the Guide\nlines range because it did not depart from the Guidelines\nat the original sentencing. Accordingly, the resentencing\njudge in Booker would have been required under\n§3742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on\njudge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise\nresult that Booker forbids.\n   The same result would occur in any sentencing in which\na district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence\noutside the Guidelines range “based on a misunderstand\ning of its authority to depart under or vary from the\nGuidelines.” Reply Brief for United States 16. For exam\nple, if §3742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no rem\nedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed\nthe Guidelines were presumptively reasonable, see Nelson\nv. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 2), or if it mistakenly thought that a non-\nGuidelines sentence required extraordinary circum\nstances, see Gall, 552 U. S., at 47, or if it incorrectly con\ncluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines based on\na policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine, see Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n101. In such cases, the district court at the initial sentenc\ning proceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence\nwithin the Guidelines range, and thus §3742(g)(2) would\nrequire the imposition of a Guidelines sentence on re\nmand. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3–5 (describing\nfurther categories of cases where “the Booker remedy\nwould be entirely unavailable if §3742(g)(2) were valid”).\n  To be sure, applying §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would\nnot always result in a Sixth Amendment violation. For\nexample, where the applicable Guidelines range rests\nsolely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\napplication of §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not ren\nder the sentence constitutionally infirm. But, as explained\nabove, that possibility was equally true with respect to the\nsentencing provisions we invalidated in Booker. See su\npra, at 16. As with those provisions, “we cannot assume\nthat Congress, if faced with the statute’s invalidity in key\napplications, would have preferred to apply the statute in\nas many other instances as possible.” 543 U. S., at 248.\nJust as we rejected a two-track system in Booker that\nwould have made the Guidelines mandatory in some cases\nand advisory in others, we reject a partial invalidation of\n§3742(g)(2) that would leave us with the same result.\n  The fact that §3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court\non remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in cases\nwhere the prior sentence expressly relied upon a depar\nture upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the\nconstitutional infirmity. As explained above, we observed\nin Booker that the availability of departures from the\napplicable Guidelines ranges in specified circumstances\n“does not avoid the constitutional issue.” Id., at 234.\nBecause “departures are not available in every case, and\nin fact are unavailable in most,” ibid., we held that reme\ndying the Sixth Amendment problem required invalidation\nof §3553(b)(1). That same remedial approach requires us\n20                   PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto invalidate §3742(g)(2).12\n   Amicus contends that any constitutional infirmity in\n§3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)\nrather than §3742(g)(2). Brief for Amicus Curiae in Sup\nport of Judgment Below 21–22. Section 3742(j)(1)(B)\nprovides that a “ground of departure” is “permissible” for\npurposes of §3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, inter alia, “author\nized under section 3553(b).” In Booker, we noted that\n“statutory cross-references” to the SRA provisions we\ninvalidated were also constitutionally infirm. 543 U. S., at\n259. Because §3742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a cross-reference\nto §3553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in\nBooker, amicus suggests that invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)\nwould cure any constitutional defect in §3742(g)(2)(B). As\nthe Government explains, however, even if §3742(j)(1)(B)\nwere invalidated and a district court could depart on any\nground at an initial sentencing, the district court would\nnot be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing\nso long as §3742(g)(2) remains in force. Because amicus’\nproposed solution would still result in the Guidelines\nbeing effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire\nset of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitu\ntional defect of §3742(g)(2).\n——————\n  12 Amicus   National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\n(NACDL) argues that, because §3742(g)(2)(B) permits a non-Guidelines\nsentence only with respect to certain “departures,” that provision\n“appears to preclude sentencing courts on remand from granting any\nand all variances under Section 3553(a).” Brief for NACDL as Amicus\nCuriae 11 (emphasis added). In Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708\n(2008), we held that a “ ‘[d]eparture’ is a term of art under the Guide\nlines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the\nframework set out in the Guidelines”; in contrast, a “variance” refers to\na non-Guidelines sentence outside the Guidelines framework. Id., at\n714. Irizarry’s holding construed the term “departure” in Rule 32(h) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because we conclude that\n§3742(g)(2) is constitutionally infirm and must be invalidated, we need\nnot decide whether its reference to “departure[s]” includes variances.\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              2\n  Amicus’ next cluster of arguments focuses on Con-\ngress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Preliminarily,\namicus contends that even if §3742(g)(2) is constitution\nally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy\ndetermination that only information available at the time\nof original sentencing should be considered, and that this\npolicy determination should inform our analysis of\nwhether §3553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing\nrehabilitation evidence. This argument, however, is based\non a faulty premise.\n  Contrary to amicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not\nreflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration\nof evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentenc\ning. To be sure, §3742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of\nlimiting the weight a sentencing court may place on post\nsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from\nresentencing outside the Guidelines range on a “ground of\ndeparture” on which it did not previously rely. But on its\nface, nothing in §3742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from\nconsidering     postsentencing     developments—including\npostsentencing rehabilitation—in selecting a sentence\nwithin the applicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2)\nalso does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons\nother than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and\nthe case is remanded (e.g., when a sentence is set aside on\ncollateral review under 28 U. S. C. §2255). In such cir\ncumstances, §3742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at\nall, much less with respect to consideration of postsentenc\ning developments. Accordingly, because we see no general\ncongressional policy reflected in §3742(g)(2) to preclude\nresentencing courts from considering postsentencing\ninformation,13 that provision has no bearing on our analy\n——————\n  13 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of\n\n§3742(g)(2) confirms that the provision, enacted as part of the\n22                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsis of whether §3553(a) permits consideration of evidence\nof postsentencing rehabilitation.\n   As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing\nrehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the\nsentencing factors that Congress has specifically in\nstructed district courts to consider. See supra, at 13–15\n(discussing §§3553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)–(D)). Amicus, how\never, argues that consideration of postsentencing reha\nbilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors:\n§3553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider\n“any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Com\nmission, and §3553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider\n“the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities\namong defendants with similar records who have been\nfound guilty of similar conduct.”\n   With regard to §3553(a)(5), amicus points to the Sen\ntencing Commission’s policy statement in USSG §5K2.19,\nwhich provides that “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative\nefforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant\nafter imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant\noffense[,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward\ndeparture when resentencing the defendant for that of\nfense.” According to amicus, that policy statement is\n“clear and unequivocal,” and as an exercise of the Sentenc\ning Commission’s “core function,” should be given effect.\n——————\nPROTECT Act of 2003, §401(e), 117 Stat. 671, was not aimed at prohib\niting district courts from considering postsentencing developments.\nRather, it was meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guide\nlines system, when a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the\ndistrict court could not impose the same sentence on remand on the\nbasis of a different departure. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 108–66, pp. 58–\n59 (2003) (noting that §401 of the PROTECT Act, inter alia, “prevent[s]\nsentencing courts, upon remand, from imposing the same illegal depar\nture on a different theory”). Like the provisions invalidated in Booker,\nthen, the purpose of §3742(g)(2) was “to make Guidelines sentencing\neven more mandatory than it had been.” 543 U. S. 220, 261 (2005). As\nwe recognized in Booker, that purpose has “ceased to be relevant.” Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

S., at 109 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, we have instructed that district\ncourts must still give “respectful consideration” to the\nnow-advisory Guidelines (and their accompanying policy\nstatements). Id., at 101. As amicus acknowledges, how\never, our post-Booker decisions make clear that a district\ncourt may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines\nsentence based on a disagreement with the Commission’s\nviews. See id., at 109–110. That is particularly true\nwhere, as here, the Commission’s views rest on wholly\nunconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentenc\ning statutes Congress enacted.\n  The commentary to USSG §5K2.19 expresses the Com\nmission’s view that departures based on postsentencing\nrehabilitation would “(1) be inconsistent with the policies\nestablished by Congress under 18 U. S. C. §3624(b) [gov\nerning good time credit] and other statutory provisions for\nreducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person;\nand (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the oppor\ntunity to be resentenced de novo.” With regard to the first\nproffered rationale, a sentencing reduction based on post\nsentencing rehabilitation can hardly be said to be “incon\nsistent with the policies” underlying an award of good time\ncredit under §3624(b) because the two serve distinctly\ndifferent penological interests.14 Indeed, the difference\n——————\n   14 An award of good time credit by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does\n\nnot affect the length of a court-imposed sentence; rather, it is an admin\nistrative reward “to provide an incentive for prisoners to ‘compl[y] with\n24                    PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween the two is reflected most obviously in the fact that\nthe BOP has no authority to award good time credit\nwhere, as in this case, the defendant’s good behavior\noccurs after a sentence has already been served.15 The\nCommission’s second proffered rationale fares no better.\nTo be sure, allowing district courts to consider evidence of\npostsentencing rehabilitation may result in disparate\ntreatment between those defendants who are sentenced\nproperly and those who must be resentenced. But that\ndisparity arises not because of arbitrary or random sen\ntencing practices, but because of the ordinary operation of\nappellate sentencing review.\n   In a closely related vein, amicus argues that considera\ntion of postsentencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with\n§3553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to consider\nthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\n——————\ninstitutional disciplinary regulations.’ ” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7) (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3624(b); alteration in\noriginal). Such credits may be revoked at any time before the date of a\nprisoner’s release. See §3624(b)(2). In contrast, a court’s imposition of\na reduced sentence based on postsentencing rehabilitation changes the\nvery terms of imprisonment and “recognizes that the [defendant’s]\nconduct since his initial sentencing warrants a less severe criminal\npunishment.” Brief for United States 50. Once imposed, a sentence\nmay be modified only in very limited circumstances. See §3582(c).\n   15 Amicus points to two other procedural mechanisms that may\n\nshorten a defendant’s sentence—early termination of a term of super\nvised release, see §3583(e)(1), and the potential for sentencing reduc\ntions based on postsentencing substantial assistance, see Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 35(b)—but neither presents an adequate substitute for a\ndistrict court’s consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation. Super\nvised release follows a term of imprisonment and serves an entirely\ndifferent purpose than the sentence imposed under §3553(a). See\nUnited States v. Johnson, 529 U. S. 53, 59 (2000) (“Supervised release\nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarcera\ntion”). Rule 35(b) departures address only postsentencing cooperation\nwith the Government, not postsentencing rehabilitation generally, and\nthus a defendant with nothing to offer the Government can gain no\nbenefit from Rule 35(b).\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

But amicus\npoints to no evidence, nor are we aware of any, suggesting\nthat Congress enacted §3553(a)(6) out of a concern with\ndisparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing\nprocess.16 The differences in procedural opportunity that\nmay result because some defendants are inevitably sen\ntenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds\nof “unwarranted” sentencing disparities that Congress\nsought to eliminate under §3553(a)(6). Cf. United States v.\nLaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 761–762 (1997) (disparity arising\nfrom exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted);\nUnited States v. Rhodes, 145 F. 3d 1375, 1381 (CADC\n1998) (“Distinguishing between prisoners whose convic\ntions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly\nseems ‘unwarranted’ ”).\n   As the Government explains, moreover, the logic of the\nCourt of Appeals’ approach below—i.e., that “post-sentence\nrehabilitation is not relevant . . . because the district court\ncould not have considered that evidence at the time of the\noriginal sentencing,” 570 F. 3d, at 965 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)—would require sentencing courts cate\n——————\n   16 Indeed, some defendants will have a longer period of time between\n\ninitial custody and trial, or between trial and sentencing, and those\ndefendants—particularly if they are released on bail—will have a\ngreater opportunity to demonstrate postoffense, presentencing rehabili\ntation. Even before Booker, the lower courts uniformly held that\nevidence of such rehabilitation could provide a basis for departing from\nthe applicable Guidelines. See USSG App. C, Amdt. 602, comment.,\np. 74 (Nov. 2003) (“[D]epartures based on extraordinary post-offense\nrehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing . . . have been allowed by every\ncircuit that has ruled on the matter”).\n26               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation,\nbut any postsentencing information, including, for exam\nple, evidence that a defendant had committed postsentenc\ning offenses. Our precedents, however, provide no basis to\nsupport such a categorical bar. See, e.g., Wasman, 468\nU. S., at 572 (“[A] sentencing authority may justify an\nincreased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant\nconduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original\nsentencing proceedings”); cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395\nU. S. 711, 723 (1969). Indeed, even the Court of Appeals\nbelow does not accept the logical consequence of its ap\nproach as it permits district courts to consider postsen\ntencing conduct that would support a higher sentence.\nSee United States v. Stapleton, 316 F. 3d 754, 757 (CA8\n2003). Nothing in §§3553(a) and 3661, however, remotely\nsuggests that Congress intended district courts to consider\nonly postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant\nwhile turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defen\ndant’s postsentencing rehabilitation. Cf. United States v.\nJones, 460 F. 3d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (“Obviously, the\ndiscretion that Booker accords sentencing judges to impose\nnon-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only\ngoes up”).\n   Finally, we note that §§3553(a)(5) and (a)(6) describe\nonly two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must\nconsider in imposing sentence. At root, amicus effectively\ninvites us to elevate two §3553(a) factors above all others.\nWe reject that invitation. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–50\n(instructing sentencing courts to “consider all of the\n§3553(a) factors” (emphasis added)).\n                             D\n  For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Court of\nAppeals erred in categorically precluding the District\nCourt from considering evidence of Pepper’s postsentenc\ning rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                27\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\non appeal. District courts post-Booker may consider evi\ndence of a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation at\nresentencing and such evidence may, in appropriate cases,\nsupport a downward variance from the advisory Guide\nlines range.17\n   The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper’s\nmotion for release pending disposition of this appeal, see\nn. 5, supra, the District Court stated that it would not\nhave exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a downward\nvariance based on postsentencing rehabilitation. That\nstatement, however, was made in light of the Court of\nAppeals’ erroneous views regarding postsentencing reha\nbilitation evidence. Because we expressly reject those\nviews today, it is unclear from the record whether the\nDistrict Court would have imposed the same sentence had\nit properly considered the extensive evidence of Pepper’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation. On remand, the District\nCourt should consider and give appropriate weight to that\nevidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning\nPepper’s conduct since his last sentencing in January\n2009. Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Circuit’s judg\nment in respect to Pepper’s sentence and remand the case\nfor resentencing consistent with this opinion.\n                            III\n  The second question presented in this case merits only a\nbrief discussion. As noted above, the original sentencing\njudge in this case granted Pepper a 40 percent downward\ndeparture pursuant to USSG §5K1.1 based on Pepper’s\n\n——————\n  17 Of course, we do not mean to imply that a district court must re\n\nduce a defendant’s sentence upon any showing of postsentencing\nrehabilitation. Nor do we mean to preclude courts of appeals from\nissuing limited remand orders, in appropriate cases, that may render\nevidence of postsentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the\nnarrow purposes of the remand proceeding. See, e.g., United States v.\nBernardo Sanchez, 569 F. 3d 995, 1000 (CA9 2009).\n28                  PEPPER v.

When the Court of Appeals vacated that\nsentence in Pepper II, and again in Pepper III, the case\nwas reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Reade. In\nresentencing Pepper, Chief Judge Reade ruled that she\nwas not bound by the prior sentencing judge’s decision to\ngrant a 40 percent downward departure and instead\ngranted only a 20 percent downward departure, which the\nCourt of Appeals upheld in Pepper IV. Pepper argues that\nthe law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to\napply the same 40 percent departure granted by the origi\nnal sentencing judge. We disagree.\n  Preliminarily, we note that the mandates in Pepper II\nand Pepper III were “general remand[s] for resentencing,”\nwhich “did not place any limitations on the discretion of\nthe newly assigned district court judge in resentencing\nPepper.” 570 F. 3d, at 963. In his merits briefs to this\nCourt, Pepper does not challenge the scope or validity of\nthe Court of Appeals’ mandate ordering de novo resentenc\ning, and thus has abandoned any argument that the man\ndate itself restricted the District Court from imposing a\ndifferent substantial assistance departure.18 The only\nquestion before us is whether the law of the case doctrine\nrequired Chief Judge Reade to adhere to the original\nsentencing judge’s decision granting a 40 percent down\nward departure.\n  Although we have described the “law of the case [a]s an\namorphous concept,” “[a]s most commonly defined, the\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of\nlaw, that decision should continue to govern the same\n——————\n  18 In any event, as the Court of Appeals recognized, neither Pepper II\n\nnor Pepper III held that a 40 percent downward departure was the only\nreasonable departure that a sentencing court could grant for Pepper’s\nsubstantial assistance; rather, the only issue those opinions actually\ndecided was that a “40% downward departure was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.” 570 F. 3d, at 963–964.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

This doctrine “di\nrects a court’s discretion, it does not limit the tribunal’s\npower.” Ibid. Accordingly, the doctrine “does not apply if\nthe court is ‘convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly\nerroneous and would work a manifest injustice.’ ” Agostini\nv. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting Arizona, 460\nU. S., at 618, n. 8; alteration in original).\n   Pepper argues that, because the original sentencing\njudge’s decision to grant the 40 percent departure was\nnever set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it\nconstituted the law of the case. As such, Pepper contends\nthat Chief Judge Reade should not have disturbed that\nruling absent “compelling justification” for overturning it.\nBrief for Petitioner 56. According to Pepper, because\nChief Judge Reade identified no such justification, the law\nof the case doctrine required her to adhere to the 40 per\ncent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.\n   As the Government explains, however, the Court of\nAppeals in Pepper III set aside Pepper’s entire sentence\nand remanded for a de novo resentencing. See 518 F. 3d,\nat 949, 953. Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the\noriginal sentencing court’s decision to impose a 40 percent\ndeparture was at one point law of the case, Pepper III\neffectively wiped the slate clean. To be sure, Pepper III\nvacated Pepper’s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated\nto the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does\nnot affect our conclusion. “A criminal sentence is a pack\nage of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectu\nate its sentencing intent.” United States v. Stinson, 97\nF. 3d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) (per curiam). Because a dis\ntrict court’s “original sentencing intent may be under\nmined by altering one portion of the calculus,” United\nStates v. White, 406 F. 3d 827, 832 (CA7 2005), an appel\nlate court when reversing one part of a defendant’s sen\ntence “may vacate the entire sentence . . . so that, on\n30               PEPPER v.

I would emphasize,\nhowever, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing\ncourt free to disregard the Guidelines at will.

UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   The Guideline in question consists of a policy statement\nthat sets forth an exception to normal Guideline rules.\nNormally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to\nconsider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sen\ntence in any case “where conduct significantly differs from\nthe norm” to which “a particular guideline linguistically\napplies.” USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b) (discussing the Guide\nlines’ general approach to departures). The policy state\nment at issue is one of a handful of Guideline rules that\nnonetheless forbid departure. It says that a defendant’s\n“[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if excep\ntional, . . . are not an appropriate basis for a downward\ndeparture when resentencing.” USSG §5K2.19. The\npolicy statement thereby adds “Post-Sentencing Rehabili\ntative Efforts” to such factors as race, sex, national origin,\ncreed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guide\nlines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking\ninto account. USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).\n                                II\n    Can a sentencing court, despite this policy statement,\ntake account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the par\nticular circumstances that this case presents? I cannot\nfind the answer to this question in the language of the\nsentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the pre-\nGuidelines case of Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241\n(1949), or in this Court’s use of the word “advisory.” As\nthe majority points out, a sentencing statute forbids any\n“ ‘limitation’ ” on the “ ‘information concerning the back\nground, character, and conduct’ ” that “ ‘a court . . . may . . .\nconsider.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3661 (empha\nsis deleted)). But this provision must refer to all relevant\ninformation. See USSG §1B1.4 and comment. (generally\nincorporating §3661, but noting that there are certain\nfactors that should not be considered for any purpose). If\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthe Guideline policy statement’s absolute prohibition on\nconsideration of postsentencing rehabilitation were legally\nbinding, then information on that score (like information\nabout race, religion, sex, or national origin) would fall\noutside the scope of this provision, for it would not be\nrelevant. Thus, reference to the statute begs the question.\n   Nor can I find much help in the majority’s reference to a\nsentencing “ ‘tradition’ ” that considers “ ‘every convicted\nperson as an individual.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Koon v.\nUnited States, 518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996)). That is because\nindividualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradi\ntion. A just legal system seeks not only to treat different\ncases differently but also to treat like cases alike. Fair\nness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to\nrecognize relevant sentencing differences. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted the sentencing statutes before us, it\nfocused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing\nfailed to treat similar offenders similarly. And Congress\nwrote statutes designed primarily (though not exclusively)\nto bring about greater uniformity in sentencing. See, e.g.,\nBooker, supra, at 253–254. The statutes do so in large\npart through the creation of a system of Guidelines writ\nten by a Sentencing Commission, which Congress in\ntended the courts to follow. See Mistretta v. United States,\n488 U. S. 361 (1989) (Sentencing Commission constitu\ntional); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 348–349\n(2007); 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) (identifying relevant factors in\nsentencing, including uniformity).\n   The Williams case is similarly unhelpful. That is be\ncause Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984—the\nlaw before us—disavowed the individualized approach to\nsentencing that that case followed. Williams emphasized\nthe importance of a sentencing court’s legal power to tailor\npunishment ability to fit the circumstances of each indi\nvidual offender. 337 U. S., at 247 (emphasizing “modern\nconcepts individualizing punishment”). But Congress,\n4                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nconcerned that individualized sentencing had gone too far,\nwrote a new sentencing law designed to help correct “dis\nparities” among similar defendants sentenced by different\njudges. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 45 (1983) (“Sentencing\ndisparities” are “unfair both to offenders and to the pub\nlic”); id., at 38 (disparities “can be traced directly to the\nunfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and\nparole authorities responsible for imposing and imple\nmenting the sentence”).\n   Booker’s description of the Guidelines as “advisory”\noffers somewhat greater assistance—but only if that word\nis read in light of the Sixth Amendment analysis that\nprecedes it. This Court has held that the Sixth Amend\nment forbids Congress (through the Commission) to create\nGuidelines that both (1) require judges (without juries) to\nfind sentencing facts and also (2) tie those facts to the\nmandatory imposition of particular sentences. 543 U. S.,\nat 226, 244; see also Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490 (Sixth\nAmendment requires jury findings in respect to factual\nmatters that require judge to increase sentence); Blakely\nv. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 303–304 (2004) (same in\nrespect to a State’s mandatory guidelines). In light of this\nSixth Amendment prohibition, the Court, believing that\nCongress would not have intended to introduce new juries\ninto each sentencing proceeding, excised the few particular\nprovisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that\napplication of the Guidelines was mandatory. Booker, 543\nU. S., at 259. The Court believed that the relevant stat\nutes remained workable without those few provisions, that\ntheir excision could further Congress’ basic sentencing\nintentions, and that excision was more likely to do so than\ninvalidation of the entire statutory scheme. With an\noccasional exception (such as the statutory provision we\nstrike down today), there is no reason to think that the\nsentencing statutes as limited in Booker run afoul of\nthe Sixth Amendment. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   Booker made clear that the remaining statutory provi\nsions, while leading us to call the Guidelines “advisory”\n(rather than “mandatory”), do not give a sentencing judge\ncarte blanche to apply, or not to apply, the Guidelines as\nthat judge chooses. Rather, the “district courts, while not\nbound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guide\nlines and take them into account when sentencing.” Id., at\n264. Moreover, Booker held that appellate court review of\nsentencing is valid. Booker explained that the “statutory\nlanguage, the structure of the [Sentencing Reform Act],\nand the sound administration of justice,” taken together,\nrequire appellate courts to apply “reasonableness stan\ndard[s]” of review. Id., at 260–261, 262 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Reasonableness standards, we added, are\n“not foreign to sentencing law.” Id., at 262. And the “Act\nhas long required their use in important sentencing cir\ncumstances—both on review of departures . . . and on\nreview of sentences imposed where there was no applica\nble Guideline.” Ibid. See also id., at 261 (appellate courts\nwill apply “a practical standard of review already familiar\nto appellate courts: review for ‘unreasonable[ness]’ ”); id.,\nat 264 (“[C]ourts of appeals” will “review sentencing deci\nsions for unreasonableness”).\n   We have also indicated that, in applying reasonableness\nstandards, the appellate courts should take account of\nsentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and Guide\nlines, as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and\nappellate courts. Thus, in Kimbrough, we observed that in\nlight of the “discrete institutional strengths” of the Sen\ntencing Commission and sentencing judges, “a district\ncourt’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may\nattract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case ‘outside the “heartland” to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply.’ ” 552\nU. S., at 109 (quoting Rita, supra, at 351). We noted,\nhowever, that “while the Guidelines are no longer binding,\n6                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncloser review may be in order when the sentencing judge\nvaries from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view\nthat the Guidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a)\nconsiderations’ even in a mine-run case.” 552 U. S., at\n109.\n                             III\n   Unlike the majority, I would decide the question\nKimbrough left open. And I would follow its suggested\nframework for evaluating “reasonableness.” As Kim\nbrough suggests, doing so takes proper account of the\ncomparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate\ncourts, and the Sentencing Commission. The trial court\ntypically better understands the individual circumstances\nof particular cases before it, while the Commission has\ncomparatively greater ability to gather information, to\nconsider a broader national picture, to compare sentences\nattaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write\nmore coherent overall standards that reflect nationally\nuniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.\n   Applying Kimbrough’s suggested framework, I would\nreason very much as does the majority. The first question\nis whether a sentencing judge might sometimes take ac\ncount of a (resentenced) offender’s postsentencing rehabili\ntation—despite a Guideline policy statement that says\nnever. I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to\ndisregard the Guidelines’ absolute prohibition, despite the\nCommission’s comparatively greater policy-formation\nabilities. That is because the Guideline policy statement\nitself runs counter to ordinary Guideline sentencing policy,\nwhich rarely forbids departures and then for very strong\npolicy reasons. Supra, at 2. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).\n   The Commission offers no convincing justification for\ncreating this exception with respect to postsentencing\nrehabilitation. The Commission’s commentary says that\nfor a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nreason (reflecting good behavior while the case is on ap\npeal) would conflict with the use of other mechanisms,\nsuch as “good-time” credits, for that purpose. But how is\nthat so? A defendant, after sentencing but while his case\nis on appeal, may or may not be entitled to “good time.”\nThat may depend upon whether he remains on bail or\nupon particular “good-time” rules. Regardless, the resen\ntencing judge can take account of any such matter. See\nalso ante, at 26–28.\n   The Commission’s commentary also suggests it would be\ninequitable to allow an offender who is being resentenced\nto receive any kind of credit for his good behavior, say\nwhile his case was on appeal. But why is that so? After\nall, the Guidelines permit a judge to take account of an\noffender’s good behavior after arrest but before initial\nsentencing. That time period could last longer than the\ntime taken up on appeal. Why should pretrial behavior\ncount but appeal time behavior not count? Like the major\nity, I find this justification for the policy statement uncon\nvincing. See ante, at 25–26.\n   The second question is whether, given the sentencing\ncourt’s power to disregard the policy statement forbidding\ndepartures based on postsentencing rehabilitation, the\nfacts and circumstances here could warrant a departure\n(or variance) for that reason. And the answer, in my view,\nis yes. This case presents unusual rehabilitative circum\nstances. As the majority observes: “By the time of his\nsecond resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free\nfor nearly five years, had attended college and achieved\nhigh grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a\npromotion, had reestablished a relationship with his\nfather, and was married and supporting his wife’s daugh\nter.” Ante, at 14. These are case-specific facts and cir\ncumstances, and they are of the kind that should lead\nappellate courts to show their “greatest respect” for a\nsentencing decision, including a departure or variance,\n8                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat rests upon them.\n                              IV\n   In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted\nthem, require courts of appeals to review sentences for\nreasonableness, including sentences that depart or vary\nfrom a specific Guideline. The appellate courts should\nreview those decisions more closely when they rest upon\ndisagreement with Guidelines policy. Kimbrough, 552\nU. S., at 109. They should review those decisions with\ngreater deference when they rest upon case-specific cir\ncumstances that place the case outside a specific Guide\nline’s “heartland.” See ibid.; Rita, 551 U. S., at 351; Koon,\n518 U. S., at 98–99.\n   By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we\ncan remain faithful to Congress’ basic intent in writing\nthem—despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions\nthat conflict with the Sixth Amendment. The statutes\ncreate a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop\nsentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines. The Guide\nlines are to further the statutes’ basic objective, namely\ngreater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account\nof special individual circumstances, primarily by permit\nting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases. By\ncollecting trial courts’ reasons for departure (or variance),\nby examining appellate court reactions, by developing\nstatistical and other empirical information, by considering\nthe views of expert penologists and others, the Commis\nsion can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See USSG ch.\n1, pt. A1, §3. Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Com\nmission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an\niterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a\nmore uniform and a more equitable sentencing system.\nSee id., at 1–15. I would interpret the statutes before us\naccordingly.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

I agree with\nthe Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on\nthe basis of 18 U. S. C. §3742(g), as amicus suggests. This\nprovision was designed to function as part of the manda\ntory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265 (2005).\nAlthough amicus’ argument is ingenious, even the sort of\nsurgery sanctioned in Booker cannot transform this provi\nsion into one that can survive in the post-Booker world.\n  I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it holds\nthat the decision below regarding evidence of postsentenc\ning rehabilitation must be reversed. That decision, which\nentirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was\nconsistent with the policy statement in §5K2.19 of the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines, but “[t]he Booker\nremedial decision . . . does not permit a court of appeals\nto treat the Guidelines’ policy decisions as binding.”\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 116 (2007)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting).\n  Under Booker, however, district judges are still required\nin almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy\ndecisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\nSee 552 U. S., at 116; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38,\n61–67 (2007) (ALITO, J., dissenting). Congress delegated\n2                    PEPPER v.

C. §§3553(a)(4), (5), and requiring judges to give\nsignificant weight to the Commission’s policy decisions\ndoes not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the\nmandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, i.e.,\nthe right to have a jury make certain factual findings that\nare relevant to sentencing.\n   While I continue to believe that sentencing judges\nshould be required to give significant weight to all Guide\nlines provisions and policy statements, see Kimbrough,\n552 U. S., at 116 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the Court in\nKimbrough held that sentencing judges may not be re\nquired to give weight to some unusual policy decisions, see\nid., at 109–110 (majority opinion). And JUSTICE BREYER\nnow makes a reasonable case that the particular policy\nstatement involved in this case is distinguishable from\nalmost all of the other rules that the Commission has\nadopted. See ante, p. ___ (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). His position seems to me more\nconsistent with Kimbrough than the Court’s. It would at\nleast prevent us from sliding all the way down the slippery\nslope that leads back to the regime of entirely discretion\nary federal sentencing that preceded the enactment of the\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.\n   Anyone familiar with the history of criminal sentencing\nin this country cannot fail to see the irony in the Court’s\npraise for the sentencing scheme exemplified by Williams\nv. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), and 18 U. S. C. §3661.*\n——————\n   * Insofar as 18 U. S. C. §3661 permitted a sentencing judge to con\nsider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision was\neffectively modified by the subsequent enactment of the Sentencing\nReform Act, which instructed the Sentencing Commission to adopt\nguidelines and policy statements that avoid “unwarranted sentencing\ndisparities,” 28 U. S. C. §991(b)(1)(B); see also §994(f), and which\nprovided that sentencing courts “shall consider . . . any pertinent policy\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)       3\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nBy the time of the enactment of the Sentencing Reform\nAct in 1984, this scheme had fallen into widespread disre\npute. See, e.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n366 (1989) (noting “[f]undamental and widespread dissat\nisfaction with the uncertainties and the disparities” of this\nscheme); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 142\n(1980) (“It has been observed . . . that sentencing is one of\nthe areas of the criminal justice system most in need of\nreform”); S. Rep. No. 98–223, p. 62 (1983) (“The shameful\ndisparity in criminal sentences is a major flaw in the\nexisting criminal justice system”). Under this system,\neach federal district judge was free to implement his or\nher individual sentencing philosophy, and therefore the\nsentence imposed in a particular case often depended\nheavily on the spin of the wheel that determined the judge\nto whom the case was assigned. See Bullington v. Mis\nsouri, 451 U. S. 430, 444, n. 16 (1981) (“There has been no\nattempt to separate policymaking from individual sentenc\ning determinations” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nM. Frankel, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order 5\n(1973) (“[T]he almost wholly unchecked and sweeping\npowers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are\nterrifying and intolerable for a society that professes\ndevotion to the rule of law”).\n   Some language in today’s opinion reads like a paean to\nthat old regime, and I fear that it may be interpreted as\nsanctioning a move back toward the system that prevailed\nprior to 1984. If that occurs, I suspect that the day will\ncome when the irrationality of that system is once again\nseen, and perhaps then the entire Booker line of cases will\nbe reexamined.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nstatement,” 18 U.

As written, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\ndo not permit district courts to impose a sentence below\nthe Guidelines range based on the defendant’s postsen\ntencing rehabilitation.1 See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010)\n(USSG). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265\n(2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme\nadvisory, a remedy that was “far broader than necessary\nto correct constitutional error.” Kimbrough v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 85, 114 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nBecause there is “no principled way to apply the Booker\nremedy,” I have explained that it is “best to apply the\nstatute as written, including 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), which\nmakes the Guidelines mandatory,” unless doing so would\nactually violate the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 116; see\nBooker, supra, at 313–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in\npart); Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 61 (2007) (THO-\nMAS, J., dissenting); Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecause doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment.\nThe constitutional problem arises only when a judge\nmakes “a finding that raises the sentence beyond the\nsentence that could have lawfully been imposed by refer\nence to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defen\ndant.” Booker, supra, at 313 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nPepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement\nwith between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine\nmixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(viii).2 United States v. Pepper,\n412 F. 3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). Because Pepper has ad\nmitted facts that would support a much longer sentence\nthan the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amend\nment problem in this case.\n   Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper’s sen\ntence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated\nthe Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG §5K1.1 depar\nture and the Government’s motion under Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month\nsentence. Guideline §5K2.19 expressly prohibits down\nward departures based on “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative\nefforts, even if exceptional.” Nor is there any provision in\nthe Guidelines for the “variance” Pepper seeks, as such\nvariances are creations of the Booker remedy. I would\ntherefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold\nPepper’s sentence.\n   Although this outcome would not represent my own\npolicy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress\nand the Federal Sentencing Commission.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–6822. Argued December 6, 2010—Decided March 2, 2011\nAfter pleading guilty to drug charges, petitioner Pepper was sentenced\n  under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to 24 months’ imprison\n  ment, a nearly 75 percent downward departure from the low end of\n  the Guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance, fol\n  lowed by five years of supervised release. In Pepper I, the Eighth\n  Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of, inter alia,\n  United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220. Pepper, who had begun serv\n  ing his supervised release, testified at his resentencing hearing that\n  he was no longer a drug addict, having completed a 500-hour drug\n  treatment program while in prison; that he was enrolled in commu\n  nity college and had achieved very good grades; and that he was\n  working part time. Pepper’s father testified that he and his son were\n  no longer estranged, and Pepper’s probation officer testified that a\n  24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper’s substan\n  tial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low\n  recidivism risk. The District Court again sentenced Pepper to 24\n  months, granting a 40 percent downward departure based on Pep\n  per’s substantial assistance and a further downward variance based\n  on, inter alia, Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. In\n  Pepper II, the Eighth Circuit again reversed and remanded for resen\n  tencing, concluding that Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation could\n  not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance, and\n  directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge. After\n  this Court vacated and remanded the Pepper II judgment in light of\n  Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, the Eighth Circuit, in Pepper III,\n  reversed and remanded once more. At the second resentencing hear\n  ing, Pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in\n  school, was about to be promoted at his job, and had married and was\n2                     PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    supporting his new family. Noting the nearly identical remand lan\n    guage of Pepper II and Pepper III, the court observed that it was not\n    bound to reduce Pepper’s range by 40 percent for substantial assis\n    tance. Instead, it found him entitled to a 20 percent reduction and\n    refused to grant a further downward variance for, inter alia, postsen\n    tencing rehabilitation. It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12\n    months of supervised release. In Pepper IV, the Eighth Circuit once\n    again rejected Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation argument. It\n    also rejected his claim that the law of the case from Pepper II and\n    Pepper III required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guide\n    lines range by at least 40 percent.\nHeld:\n    1. When a defendant’s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a dis\n trict court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant’s\n postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate\n cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guide\n lines range. Pp. 9–27.\n       (a) Consistent with the principle that “the punishment should fit\n the offender and not merely the crime,” Williams v. New York, 337\n U. S. 241, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform pol\n icy “under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion\n in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determin\n ing the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits\n fixed by law,” id., at 246, particularly “the fullest information possi\n ble concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics,” id., at 247.\n That principle is codified at 18 U. S. C. §3661, which provides that\n “[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information” a sentencing court\n may consider “concerning the [defendant’s] background, character,\n and conduct,” and at §3553(a), which specifies that sentencing courts\n must consider, among other things, a defendant’s “history and char\n acteristics,” §3553(a)(1). The Guidelines, which Booker made “effec\n tively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245, “should be the starting point and\n the initial benchmark,” but district courts may impose sentences\n within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of\n the §3553(a) factors, subject to appellate review for “reasonableness,”\n Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49–51. This sentencing frame\n work applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resen\n tencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal. Pp. 9–12.\n       (b) Postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a down\n ward variance from the advisory Guidelines range. The plain lan\n guage of §3661 makes clear that there is “[n]o limitation . . . on . . .\n background, character, and conduct” information, and it makes no\n distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resen\n tencing. In addition, postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhighly relevant to several §3553(a) factors that district courts are re\nquired to consider at sentencing. The extensive evidence of Pepper’s\nrehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the se\nlection of an appropriate sentence here. Most fundamentally, that\nevidence provides the most up-to-date picture of his “history and\ncharacteristics.” §3553(a)(1). At the time of his initial sentencing, he\nwas an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family\nand sold drugs. By his second resentencing, he had been drug-free\nfor nearly five years, was attending college, was a top employee\nslated for promotion, had re-established a relationship with his fa\nther, and was married and supporting a family. His postsentencing\nconduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in fu\nture criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must\nconsider. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C). Pp. 12–15.\n     (c) The contrary arguments advanced by amicus appointed to de\nfend the judgment are unpersuasive. Pp. 15–26.\n        (1) While §3742(g)(2)—which prohibits a district court at re\nsentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range\nexcept upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing—\neffectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing reha\nbilitation, that provision is invalid after Booker. Like the provisions\ninvalidated in Booker—§§3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)—§3742(g)(2) re\nquires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory\nin an entire set of cases. Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the\nprovision. While applying §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not al\nways result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a par\ntial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively manda\ntory in some cases and advisory in others. The fact that §3742(g)(2)\npermits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines\nsentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure\nupheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional\ninfirmity. And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in\n§3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.\nPp. 15–20.\n        (2) This Court finds unpersuasive amicus’ arguments focusing\non Congress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Contrary to\namicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional pur\npose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evi\ndence. Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Court’s analysis of\nwhether §3553(a) permits consideration of such evidence. Nor is the\nconsideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the\nsentencing factor in §3553(a)(5)—which directs sentencing courts to\nconsider “any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Commis\nsion—particularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is\n4                     PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant\n    sentencing statutes. Consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation\n    is also not inconsistent with §3553(a)(6)—which requires courts to\n    consider “the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities\n    among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n    similar conduct”—as any disparity arises only from the normal trial\n    and sentencing process. The differences in procedural opportunity\n    that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in\n    error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of “unwarranted”\n    sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under\n    §3553(a)(6). Pp. 21–26.\n          (d) On remand, the District Court should consider and give ap\n    propriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence, as\n    well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper’s conduct since his\n    last sentencing. Pp. 26–27.\n       2. Because the Eighth Circuit in Pepper III set aside Pepper’s en\n    tire sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing, the District\n    Court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the\n    same 40 percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.\n    To avoid undermining a district court’s original sentencing intent, an\n    appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence “may vacate\n    the entire sentence . . . so that, on remand, the trial court can recon\n    figure the sentencing plan . . . to satisfy [§3553(a)’s] sentencing fac\n    tors.” Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 253. That is what\n    the Eighth Circuit did here.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 2, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This Court has long recognized that sentencing judges\n“exercise a wide discretion” in the types of evidence they\nmay consider when imposing sentence and that “[h]ighly\nrelevant—if not essential—to [the] selection of an appro\npriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant’s life and characteris\ntics.” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246–247\n(1949). Congress codified this principle at 18 U. S. C.\n§3661, which provides that “[n]o limitation shall be placed\non the information” a sentencing court may consider “con\ncerning the [defendant’s] background, character, and con\nduct,” and at §3553(a), which sets forth certain factors\nthat sentencing courts must consider, including “the his\ntory and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nconcluded in this case that the District Court, when resen\ntencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set\naside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner’s\nrehabilitation since his initial sentencing. That conclusion\nconflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentenc\ning law and Congress’ express directives in §§3661 and\n2                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n3553(a).     Although a separate statutory provision,\n§3742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from\nimposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at\nthe prior sentencing—thus effectively precluding the court\nfrom considering postsentencing rehabilitation for pur\nposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence—that provi\nsion did not survive our holding in United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and we expressly invalidate\nit today.\n   We hold that when a defendant’s sentence has been set\naside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may\nconsider evidence of the defendant’s postsentencing reha\nbilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate\ncases, support a downward variance from the now\nadvisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Sepa\nrately, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ ruling that the law\nof the case doctrine did not require the District Court in\nthis case to apply the same percentage departure from the\nGuidelines range for substantial assistance that had been\napplied at petitioner’s prior sentencing.\n                             I\n  In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested\nand charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or\nmore of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S. C. §846.\nAfter pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing\nbefore then-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Pepper’s\nsentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121\nmonths.1 The Government moved for a downward depar\n——————\n  1 Although the charge to which Pepper pleaded guilty carried a man\n\ndatory minimum of 120 months’ imprisonment, the mandatory mini\nmum did not apply because he was eligible for safety-valve relief\npursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(f) (2000 ed.) and §5C1.2 of the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

The Government appealed Pepper’s\nsentence, and in June 2005, the Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in\nlight of our intervening decision in Booker (and for another\nreason not relevant here). See United States v. Pepper,\n412 F. 3d 995, 999 (2005) (Pepper I). Pepper completed his\n24-month sentence three days after Pepper I was issued\nand began serving his term of supervised release.\n   In May 2006, the District Court conducted a resentenc\ning hearing and heard from three witnesses. In his testi\nmony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously\nbeen a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour\ndrug treatment program while in prison and he no longer\nused any drugs. App. 104–105. Pepper then explained\nthat since his release from prison, he had enrolled at a\nlocal community college as a full-time student and had\nearned A’s in all of his classes in the prior semester. Id.,\nat 106–107. Pepper also testified that he had obtained\nemployment within a few weeks after being released from\ncustody and was continuing to work part-time while at\ntending school. Id., at 106–110. Pepper confirmed that he\nwas in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised\nrelease and described his changed attitude since his ar\nrest.

My\nlife was going nowhere before, and I think it’s going some\nwhere now”).\n   Pepper’s father testified that he had virtually no contact\nwith Pepper during the 5-year period leading up to his\narrest. Id., at 117. Pepper’s drug treatment program,\naccording to his father, “truly sobered him up” and “made\nhis way of thinking change.” Id., at 121. He explained\nthat Pepper was now “much more mature” and “serious in\nterms of planning for the future,” id., at 119, and that as a\nconsequence, he had re-established a relationship with his\nson, id., at 118–119.\n   Finally, Pepper’s probation officer testified that, in his\nview, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of\nPepper’s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilita\ntion, and demonstrated low risk of recidivism. Id., at 126–\n131. The probation officer also prepared a sentencing\nmemorandum that further set forth the reasons support\ning his recommendation for a 24-month sentence.\n   The District Court adopted as its findings of fact the\ntestimony of the three witnesses and the probation offi\ncer’s sentencing memorandum. The court granted a 40\npercent downward departure based on Pepper’s substan\ntial assistance, reducing the bottom of the Guidelines\nrange from 97 to 58 months. The court then granted a\nfurther 59 percent downward variance based on, inter alia,\nPepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. Id., at\n143–148.3 The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of\nimprisonment, concluding that “it would [not] advance any\n——————\n  3 The court also cited Pepper’s lack of a violent history and, to a lesser\n\nextent, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity with\nPepper’s co-conspirators.

See United States v. Pepper, 486 F. 3d 408,\n410, 413 (CA8 2007) (Pepper II). The court concluded that,\nwhile it was “a close call, [it could not] say the district\ncourt abused its discretion” by granting the 40 percent\ndownward departure for substantial assistance. Id., at\n411. The court found the further 59 percent downward\nvariance, however, to be an abuse of discretion. Id., at\n412–413. In doing so, the court held that Pepper’s “post\nsentencing rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to\nconsider in granting a downward variance.” Id., at 413.\nThe court stated that evidence of postsentencing reha\nbilitation “ ‘is not relevant and will not be permitted at\nresentencing because the district court could not have\nconsidered that evidence at the time of the original\nsentencing,’ ” and permitting courts to consider post\nsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing “would create\nunwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant\ninequities into the sentencing process.” Ibid.4 The Court\nof Appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different\ndistrict judge for resentencing. Ibid.\n   After the Court of Appeals’ mandate issued, Pepper’s\ncase was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R.\nReade. In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order\non the scope of the remand from Pepper II, stating that\n“[t]he court will not consider itself bound to reduce [Pep\n——————\n  4 The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court “further erred\n\nby considering Pepper’s lack of violent history, which history had\nalready been accounted for in the sentencing Guidelines calculation,\nand by considering sentencing disparity among Pepper’s co-defendants\nwithout adequate foundation and explanation.” Pepper II, 486 F. 3d, at\n413.\n6                PEPPER v.

Pepper, No. 03–\nCR–4113–LRR, 2007 WL 2076041, *4 (ND Iowa 2007). In\nthe meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of\ncertiorari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition,\nvacated the judgment in Pepper II, and remanded the case\nto the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of\nGall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38 (2007). See Pepper v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 1089 (2008).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals held that Gall did not\nalter its prior conclusion that “post-sentence rehabilitation\nis an impermissible factor to consider in granting a down\nward variance.” 518 F. 3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) (Pepper\nIII). The court again reversed the sentence and remanded\nfor resentencing.\n   In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened Pepper’s\nsecond resentencing hearing. Pepper informed the court\nthat he was still attending school and was now working as\na supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer,\nwhere he was recently selected by management as “associ\nate of the year” and was likely to be promoted the follow\ning January. App. 320, 323. Pepper also stated that he\nhad recently married and was now supporting his wife and\nher daughter. Id., at 321. Pepper’s father reiterated that\nPepper was moving forward in both his career and his\nfamily life and that he remained in close touch with\nhis son. See id., at 300–304.\n   In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentenc\ning memorandum. Noting that the remand language of\nPepper III was nearly identical to the language in Pepper\nII, the court again observed that it was “not bound to\nreduce [Pepper’s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by\n40%” for substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper\nwas entitled only to a 20 percent downward departure\nbecause the assistance was “timely, helpful and impor\ntant” but “in no way extraordinary.” Sealed Sentencing\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

The court also rejected Pepper’s request for\na downward variance based on, inter alia, his postsentenc\ning rehabilitation. Id., at 16.\n   The District Court reconvened Pepper’s resentencing\nhearing in January 2009. The court’s decision to grant a\n20 percent downward departure for substantial assistance\nresulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97\nmonths. The court also granted the Government’s motion\nunder Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure to account for investigative assistance Pepper pro\nvided after he was initially sentenced. The court imposed\na 65-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by 12\nmonths of supervised release.5\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed Pepper’s 65-month sen\ntence. 570 F. 3d 958 (CA8 2009) (Pepper IV). As relevant\nhere, the Court of Appeals rejected Pepper’s argument\nthat the District Court erred in refusing to consider his\npostsentencing rehabilitation. The court acknowledged\nthat “Pepper made significant progress during and follow\ning his initial period of imprisonment” and “commend[ed]\nPepper on the positive changes he has made in his life,”\nbut concluded that Pepper’s argument was foreclosed by\nCircuit precedent holding that “post-sentencing rehabilita\ntion is not a permissible factor to consider in granting a\ndownward variance.” Id., at 964–965 (citing United States\nv. Jenners, 473 F. 3d 894, 899 (CA8 2007); United States v.\nMcMannus, 496 F. 3d 846, 852, n. 4 (CA8 2007)).\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper’s claim that\nthe scope of the remand and the law of the case from\nPepper II and Pepper III required the District Court to\n——————\n  5 After the District Court resentenced Pepper to 65 months’ impris\n\nonment, Pepper was returned to federal custody.

The court noted that\nits remand orders in Pepper II and Pepper III were “gen\neral remand[s] for resentencing,” which “did not place any\nlimitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district\ncourt judge in resentencing.” 570 F. 3d, at 963. The court\nfurther noted that, although issues decided by an appel\nlate court become law of the case on remand to the sen\ntencing court, its earlier decisions merely held that a 40\npercent downward departure for substantial assistance\nwas not an abuse of discretion, not that the district court\nwould be bound by the 40 percent departure previously\ngranted. Id., at 963–964.\n   We granted Pepper’s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561\nU. S. ___ (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a\ndistrict court, after a defendant’s sentence has been set\naside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward\nvariance when resentencing the defendant, a question that\nhas divided the Courts of Appeals;6 and (2) whether the\nresentencing court was required, under the law of the case\ndoctrine, to apply the same percentage departure from the\nGuidelines range for substantial assistance that had been\napplied at Pepper’s prior sentencing.

Permitting sentenc\ning courts to consider the widest possible breadth of\ninformation about a defendant “ensures that the punish\nment will suit not merely the offense but the individual\ndefendant.” Wasman v. United States, 468 U. S. 559, 564\n(1984).\n   In 1970, Congress codified the “longstanding principle\nthat sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider\nvarious kinds of information” at 18 U. S. C. §3577 (1970\ned.). United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 151 (1997) (per\ncuriam). Section 3577 (1970 ed.) provided:\n     “No limitation shall be placed on the information con\n     cerning the background, character, and conduct of a\n     person convicted of an offense which a court of the\n     United States may receive and consider for the pur\n     pose of imposing an appropriate sentence.” (Emphasis\n     added.)\nIn the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), 18 U. S. C.\n§3551 et seq., Congress effected fundamental changes to\nfederal sentencing by creating the Federal Sentencing\nCommission and introducing the Guidelines scheme. In\ndoing so, however, Congress recodified §3577 without\nchange at §3661. The Sentencing Commission, moreover,\nexpressly incorporated §3661 in the Guidelines:\n     “In determining the sentence to impose within the\n     guideline range, or whether a departure from the\n     guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, with\n     out limitation, any information concerning the back\n     ground, character and conduct of the defendant,\n     unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U. S. C.\n     §3661.” USSG §1B1.4 (2010) (emphasis added).\nBoth Congress and the Sentencing Commission thus\nexpressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentenc\ning courts to “conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972).8\n   The SRA did constrain sentencing courts’ discretion in\nimportant respects, most notably by making the Guide\nlines mandatory, see 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV), and by specifying various factors that courts\nmust consider in exercising their discretion, see §3553(a).\nIn our seminal decision in Booker, we held that where\nfacts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence\nincreased the applicable Guidelines range, treating the\nGuidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated\nthe Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be\ntried by a jury and to have every element of an offense\nproved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.\n543 U. S., at 243–244. Our remedial opinion in Booker\ninvalidated two offending provisions in the SRA, see id., at\n245 (invalidating 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and\ninstructed the district courts to treat the Guidelines as\n“effectively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245.\n   Our post-Booker opinions make clear that, although a\nsentencing court must “give respectful consideration to the\nGuidelines, Booker permits the court to tailor the sentence\nin light of other statutory concerns as well.” Kimbrough v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 85, 101 (2007) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Accordingly, although the\n“Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial\nbenchmark,” district courts may impose sentences within\nstatutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all\nof the factors listed in §3553(a), subject to appellate review\nfor “reasonableness.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. This\n\n——————\n  8 Of course, sentencing courts’ discretion under §3661 is subject to\nconstitutional constraints. See, e.g., United States v. Leung, 40 F. 3d\n577, 586 (CA2 1994) (“A defendant’s race or nationality may play no\nadverse role in the administration of justice, including at sentencing”).\n12               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsentencing framework applies both at a defendant’s initial\nsentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a\nsentence has been set aside on appeal. See 18 U. S. C.\n§3742(g) (“A district court to which a case is remanded . . .\nshall resentence a defendant in accordance with section\n3553”); see also Dillon v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10) (distinguishing between “sentence\nmodification proceedings” under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2),\nwhich “do not implicate the interests identified in Booker,”\nand “plenary resentencing proceedings,” which do).\n                              B\n  In light of the federal sentencing framework described\nabove, we think it clear that when a defendant’s sentence\nhas been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for\nresentencing, a district court may consider evidence of a\ndefendant’s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and\nthat such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a\ndownward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.\n  Preliminarily, Congress could not have been clearer in\ndirecting that “[n]o limitation . . . be placed on the infor\nmation concerning the background, character, and con\nduct” of a defendant that a district court may “receive and\nconsider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sen\ntence.” 18 U. S. C. §3661. The plain language of §3661\nmakes no distinction between a defendant’s initial sen\ntencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sen\ntence has been set aside on appeal. We have recognized\nthat “the broad language of §3661” does not provide “any\nbasis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against\nconsidering certain types of evidence at sentencing.”\nWatts, 519 U. S., at 152. A categorical bar on the consid\neration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would\ndirectly contravene Congress’ expressed intent in §3661.\n  In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation\nmay be highly relevant to several of the §3553(a) factors\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Congress has expressly instructed district courts to\nconsider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsen\ntencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to “the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant.” §3553(a)(1).\nSuch evidence may also be pertinent to “the need for the\nsentence imposed” to serve the general purposes of sen\ntencing set forth in §3553(a)(2)—in particular, to “afford\nadequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” “protect the\npublic from further crimes of the defendant,” and “provide\nthe defendant with needed educational or vocational train\ning . . . or other correctional treatment in the most ef\nfective manner.” §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(D); see McMannus, 496\nF. 3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (“In assessing . . .\ndeterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18\nU. S. C. §3553(a)(2)(B)(C) & (D), there would seem to be no\nbetter evidence than a defendant’s post-incarceration\nconduct”). Postsentencing rehabilitation may also criti\ncally inform a sentencing judge’s overarching duty under\n§3553(a) to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary” to comply with the sentencing purposes\nset forth in §3553(a)(2).\n  As the original sentencing judge recognized, the exten\nsive evidence of Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial\nsentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appro\npriate sentence in this case. Most fundamentally, evi\ndence of Pepper’s conduct since his release from custody in\nJune 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper’s\n“history and characteristics.” §3553(a)(1); see United\nStates v. Bryson, 229 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (“[A]\ncourt’s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he\nstands before the court on the day of sentencing”). At the\ntime of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25\nyear-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from\nhis family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a\nmethamphetamine conspiracy. By the time of his second\nresentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for\n14               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnearly five years, had attended college and achieved high\ngrades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promo\ntion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and\nwas married and supporting his wife’s daughter. There is\nno question that this evidence of Pepper’s conduct since\nhis initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the\n“history and characteristics” of a defendant that Congress\nintended sentencing courts to consider. §3553(a).\n   Pepper’s postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the\nlikelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a\ncentral factor that district courts must assess when impos\ning sentence. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C); Gall, 552 U. S., at\n59 (“Gall’s self-motivated rehabilitation . . . lends strong\nsupport to the conclusion that imprisonment was not\nnecessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal\nconduct or to protect the public from his future criminal\nacts” (citing §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C))). As recognized by Pep\nper’s probation officer, Pepper’s steady employment, as\nwell as his successful completion of a 500-hour drug\ntreatment program and his drug-free condition, also\nsuggest a diminished need for “educational or vocation-\nal training . . . or other correctional treatment.”\n§3553(a)(2)(D). Finally, Pepper’s exemplary postsentenc\ning conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of\n“his present purposes and tendencies and significantly to\nsuggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline\nthat ought to be imposed upon him.” Ashe, 302 U. S., at\n55. Accordingly, evidence of Pepper’s postsentencing\nrehabilitation bears directly on the District Court’s over\narching duty to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not\ngreater than necessary” to serve the purposes of sentenc\ning. §3553(a).\n   In sum, the Court of Appeals’ ruling prohibiting the\nDistrict Court from considering any evidence of Pepper’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts\nwith longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontravenes Congress’ directives in §§3661 and 3553(a).\n                             C\n  Amicus nevertheless advances two principal arguments\nin defense of the Court of Appeals’ ruling: (1) 18 U. S. C.\n§3742(g)(2), which restricts the discretion of a resentenc\ning court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence,\neffectively forecloses consideration of a defendant’s post\nsentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting district\ncourts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would\ndefeat Congress’ objectives under §3553(a). We are not\npersuaded.\n                               1\n  Amicus’ main argument relies on 18 U. S. C. §3742(g)(2),\na provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below.\nThat provision states that when a sentence is set aside on\nappeal, the district court to which the case is remanded:\n    “shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable\n    guidelines range except upon a ground that—\n      “(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in\n    the written statement of reasons required by section\n    3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of\n    the defendant prior to the appeal; and\n      “(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding\n    the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.”\nIn operation, §3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a dis\ntrict court on remand by precluding the court from impos\ning a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a\n“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon in\nthe prior sentencing and upheld on appeal. Amicus thus\ncorrectly contends that, on its face, §3742(g)(2) effectively\nforecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence\nof a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes\nof imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a prac\ntical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the\n16                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprior sentencing. As the Government concedes, however,\n§3742(g)(2) is invalid after Booker.\n  As we have explained, Booker held that where judicial\nfactfinding increases a defendant’s applicable Sentencing\nGuidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in\nthose circumstances would violate the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every\nelement of an offense proved by the Government beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See supra, at 11. We recognized in\nBooker that, although the SRA permitted departures from\nthe applicable Guidelines range in limited circumstances,9\n“departures are not available in every case, and in fact are\nunavailable in most.” 543 U. S., at 234. Because in those\ninstances, “the judge is bound to impose a sentence within\nthe Guidelines range,” we concluded that the availability\nof departures in certain circumstances “does not avoid the\nconstitutional issue.” Ibid.\n  To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the\nGuidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provi\nsions of the SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose\na sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and\n§3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the\nstandard of appellate review, including de novo review of\nGuidelines departures. 543 U. S., at 259. We invalidated\nthese provisions even though we recognized that manda\ntory application of the Guidelines would not always result\nin a Sixth Amendment violation.10 Indeed, although the\n——————\n  9 See 18 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (“The incom\nplete remedy we rejected in Booker would have required\ncourts to treat the Guidelines differently in similar pro\nceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and consid\nerable administrative challenges”).\n   We did not expressly mention §3742(g)(2) in Booker,11\nbut the rationale we set forth in that opinion for invalidat\ning §§3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) applies equally to §3742(g)(2).\nAs with those provisions, §3742(g)(2) requires district\ncourts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in\nan entire set of cases. Specifically, §3742(g)(2) precludes a\ndistrict court on remand from imposing a sentence “out\nside the applicable guidelines range” except upon a\n“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon by\nthe court at the prior sentencing and upheld by the court\nof appeals. In circumstances in which the district court\ndid not rely upon such a departure ground at the prior\nsentencing, §3742(g)(2) would require the court on remand\nto impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines\nrange, thus rendering the Guidelines effectively manda\ntory.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand to apply the Guidelines range, as §3742(g)(2) does,\nwill often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the\nreasons we explained in Booker. Accordingly, as with the\nprovisions in Booker, the proper remedy here is to invali\ndate §3742(g)(2).\n   The sentencing proceeding at issue in Booker itself\nillustrates why §3742(g)(2) cannot withstand Sixth\nAmendment scrutiny. The district court in Booker in\ncreased the defendant’s then-mandatory Guidelines range\nbased on a drug-quantity finding that it, rather than\nthe jury, made. 543 U. S., at 227. After we held that the\nGuidelines must be treated as advisory, we remanded the\ncase for resentencing. Id., at 267. Had §3742(g)(2) re\nmained valid after Booker, the district court on remand\nwould have been required to sentence within the Guide\nlines range because it did not depart from the Guidelines\nat the original sentencing. Accordingly, the resentencing\njudge in Booker would have been required under\n§3742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on\njudge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise\nresult that Booker forbids.\n   The same result would occur in any sentencing in which\na district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence\noutside the Guidelines range “based on a misunderstand\ning of its authority to depart under or vary from the\nGuidelines.” Reply Brief for United States 16. For exam\nple, if §3742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no rem\nedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed\nthe Guidelines were presumptively reasonable, see Nelson\nv. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 2), or if it mistakenly thought that a non-\nGuidelines sentence required extraordinary circum\nstances, see Gall, 552 U. S., at 47, or if it incorrectly con\ncluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines based on\na policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine, see Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n101. In such cases, the district court at the initial sentenc\ning proceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence\nwithin the Guidelines range, and thus §3742(g)(2) would\nrequire the imposition of a Guidelines sentence on re\nmand. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3–5 (describing\nfurther categories of cases where “the Booker remedy\nwould be entirely unavailable if §3742(g)(2) were valid”).\n  To be sure, applying §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would\nnot always result in a Sixth Amendment violation. For\nexample, where the applicable Guidelines range rests\nsolely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\napplication of §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not ren\nder the sentence constitutionally infirm. But, as explained\nabove, that possibility was equally true with respect to the\nsentencing provisions we invalidated in Booker. See su\npra, at 16. As with those provisions, “we cannot assume\nthat Congress, if faced with the statute’s invalidity in key\napplications, would have preferred to apply the statute in\nas many other instances as possible.” 543 U. S., at 248.\nJust as we rejected a two-track system in Booker that\nwould have made the Guidelines mandatory in some cases\nand advisory in others, we reject a partial invalidation of\n§3742(g)(2) that would leave us with the same result.\n  The fact that §3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court\non remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in cases\nwhere the prior sentence expressly relied upon a depar\nture upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the\nconstitutional infirmity. As explained above, we observed\nin Booker that the availability of departures from the\napplicable Guidelines ranges in specified circumstances\n“does not avoid the constitutional issue.” Id., at 234.\nBecause “departures are not available in every case, and\nin fact are unavailable in most,” ibid., we held that reme\ndying the Sixth Amendment problem required invalidation\nof §3553(b)(1).

Section 3742(j)(1)(B)\nprovides that a “ground of departure” is “permissible” for\npurposes of §3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, inter alia, “author\nized under section 3553(b).” In Booker, we noted that\n“statutory cross-references” to the SRA provisions we\ninvalidated were also constitutionally infirm. 543 U. S., at\n259. Because §3742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a cross-reference\nto §3553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in\nBooker, amicus suggests that invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)\nwould cure any constitutional defect in §3742(g)(2)(B). As\nthe Government explains, however, even if §3742(j)(1)(B)\nwere invalidated and a district court could depart on any\nground at an initial sentencing, the district court would\nnot be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing\nso long as §3742(g)(2) remains in force. Because amicus’\nproposed solution would still result in the Guidelines\nbeing effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire\nset of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitu\ntional defect of §3742(g)(2).\n——————\n  12 Amicus   National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\n(NACDL) argues that, because §3742(g)(2)(B) permits a non-Guidelines\nsentence only with respect to certain “departures,” that provision\n“appears to preclude sentencing courts on remand from granting any\nand all variances under Section 3553(a).” Brief for NACDL as Amicus\nCuriae 11 (emphasis added). In Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708\n(2008), we held that a “ ‘[d]eparture’ is a term of art under the Guide\nlines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the\nframework set out in the Guidelines”; in contrast, a “variance” refers to\na non-Guidelines sentence outside the Guidelines framework. Id., at\n714. Irizarry’s holding construed the term “departure” in Rule 32(h) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because we conclude that\n§3742(g)(2) is constitutionally infirm and must be invalidated, we need\nnot decide whether its reference to “departure[s]” includes variances.\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              2\n  Amicus’ next cluster of arguments focuses on Con-\ngress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Preliminarily,\namicus contends that even if §3742(g)(2) is constitution\nally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy\ndetermination that only information available at the time\nof original sentencing should be considered, and that this\npolicy determination should inform our analysis of\nwhether §3553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing\nrehabilitation evidence. This argument, however, is based\non a faulty premise.\n  Contrary to amicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not\nreflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration\nof evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentenc\ning. To be sure, §3742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of\nlimiting the weight a sentencing court may place on post\nsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from\nresentencing outside the Guidelines range on a “ground of\ndeparture” on which it did not previously rely. But on its\nface, nothing in §3742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from\nconsidering     postsentencing     developments—including\npostsentencing rehabilitation—in selecting a sentence\nwithin the applicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2)\nalso does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons\nother than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and\nthe case is remanded (e.g., when a sentence is set aside on\ncollateral review under 28 U. S. C. §2255). In such cir\ncumstances, §3742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at\nall, much less with respect to consideration of postsentenc\ning developments. Accordingly, because we see no general\ncongressional policy reflected in §3742(g)(2) to preclude\nresentencing courts from considering postsentencing\ninformation,13 that provision has no bearing on our analy\n——————\n  13 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of\n\n§3742(g)(2) confirms that the provision, enacted as part of the\n22                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsis of whether §3553(a) permits consideration of evidence\nof postsentencing rehabilitation.\n   As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing\nrehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the\nsentencing factors that Congress has specifically in\nstructed district courts to consider. See supra, at 13–15\n(discussing §§3553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)–(D)). Amicus, how\never, argues that consideration of postsentencing reha\nbilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors:\n§3553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider\n“any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Com\nmission, and §3553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider\n“the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities\namong defendants with similar records who have been\nfound guilty of similar conduct.”\n   With regard to §3553(a)(5), amicus points to the Sen\ntencing Commission’s policy statement in USSG §5K2.19,\nwhich provides that “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative\nefforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant\nafter imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant\noffense[,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward\ndeparture when resentencing the defendant for that of\nfense.” According to amicus, that policy statement is\n“clear and unequivocal,” and as an exercise of the Sentenc\ning Commission’s “core function,” should be given effect.\n——————\nPROTECT Act of 2003, §401(e), 117 Stat. 671, was not aimed at prohib\niting district courts from considering postsentencing developments.\nRather, it was meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guide\nlines system, when a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the\ndistrict court could not impose the same sentence on remand on the\nbasis of a different departure. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 108–66, pp. 58–\n59 (2003) (noting that §401 of the PROTECT Act, inter alia, “prevent[s]\nsentencing courts, upon remand, from imposing the same illegal depar\nture on a different theory”). Like the provisions invalidated in Booker,\nthen, the purpose of §3742(g)(2) was “to make Guidelines sentencing\neven more mandatory than it had been.” 543 U. S. 220, 261 (2005). As\nwe recognized in Booker, that purpose has “ceased to be relevant.” Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below\n31–32.\n  To be sure, we have recognized that the Commission\npost-Booker continues to “fil[l] an important institutional\nrole” because “[i]t has the capacity courts lack to base its\ndeterminations on empirical data and national experience,\nguided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.”\nKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 109 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, we have instructed that district\ncourts must still give “respectful consideration” to the\nnow-advisory Guidelines (and their accompanying policy\nstatements). Id., at 101. As amicus acknowledges, how\never, our post-Booker decisions make clear that a district\ncourt may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines\nsentence based on a disagreement with the Commission’s\nviews. See id., at 109–110. That is particularly true\nwhere, as here, the Commission’s views rest on wholly\nunconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentenc\ning statutes Congress enacted.\n  The commentary to USSG §5K2.19 expresses the Com\nmission’s view that departures based on postsentencing\nrehabilitation would “(1) be inconsistent with the policies\nestablished by Congress under 18 U. S. C. §3624(b) [gov\nerning good time credit] and other statutory provisions for\nreducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person;\nand (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the oppor\ntunity to be resentenced de novo.” With regard to the first\nproffered rationale, a sentencing reduction based on post\nsentencing rehabilitation can hardly be said to be “incon\nsistent with the policies” underlying an award of good time\ncredit under §3624(b) because the two serve distinctly\ndifferent penological interests.14 Indeed, the difference\n——————\n   14 An award of good time credit by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does\n\nnot affect the length of a court-imposed sentence; rather, it is an admin\nistrative reward “to provide an incentive for prisoners to ‘compl[y] with\n24                    PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween the two is reflected most obviously in the fact that\nthe BOP has no authority to award good time credit\nwhere, as in this case, the defendant’s good behavior\noccurs after a sentence has already been served.15 The\nCommission’s second proffered rationale fares no better.\nTo be sure, allowing district courts to consider evidence of\npostsentencing rehabilitation may result in disparate\ntreatment between those defendants who are sentenced\nproperly and those who must be resentenced. But that\ndisparity arises not because of arbitrary or random sen\ntencing practices, but because of the ordinary operation of\nappellate sentencing review.\n   In a closely related vein, amicus argues that considera\ntion of postsentencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with\n§3553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to consider\nthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\n——————\ninstitutional disciplinary regulations.’ ” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7) (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3624(b); alteration in\noriginal). Such credits may be revoked at any time before the date of a\nprisoner’s release. See §3624(b)(2). In contrast, a court’s imposition of\na reduced sentence based on postsentencing rehabilitation changes the\nvery terms of imprisonment and “recognizes that the [defendant’s]\nconduct since his initial sentencing warrants a less severe criminal\npunishment.” Brief for United States 50. Once imposed, a sentence\nmay be modified only in very limited circumstances. See §3582(c).\n   15 Amicus points to two other procedural mechanisms that may\n\nshorten a defendant’s sentence—early termination of a term of super\nvised release, see §3583(e)(1), and the potential for sentencing reduc\ntions based on postsentencing substantial assistance, see Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 35(b)—but neither presents an adequate substitute for a\ndistrict court’s consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation. Super\nvised release follows a term of imprisonment and serves an entirely\ndifferent purpose than the sentence imposed under §3553(a). See\nUnited States v. Johnson, 529 U. S. 53, 59 (2000) (“Supervised release\nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarcera\ntion”). Rule 35(b) departures address only postsentencing cooperation\nwith the Government, not postsentencing rehabilitation generally, and\nthus a defendant with nothing to offer the Government can gain no\nbenefit from Rule 35(b).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    25\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Court of Appeals also rested its holding on this\nground, reasoning that “ ‘allowing [postsentencing reha\nbilitation] evidence to influence [defendant’s] sentence\nwould be grossly unfair to the vast majority of defendants\nwho receive no sentencing-court review of any positive\npost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.’ ” 570 F. 3d, at 965\n(quoting McMannus, 496 F. 3d, at 852, n. 4). But amicus\npoints to no evidence, nor are we aware of any, suggesting\nthat Congress enacted §3553(a)(6) out of a concern with\ndisparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing\nprocess.16 The differences in procedural opportunity that\nmay result because some defendants are inevitably sen\ntenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds\nof “unwarranted” sentencing disparities that Congress\nsought to eliminate under §3553(a)(6). Cf. United States v.\nLaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 761–762 (1997) (disparity arising\nfrom exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted);\nUnited States v. Rhodes, 145 F. 3d 1375, 1381 (CADC\n1998) (“Distinguishing between prisoners whose convic\ntions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly\nseems ‘unwarranted’ ”).\n   As the Government explains, moreover, the logic of the\nCourt of Appeals’ approach below—i.e., that “post-sentence\nrehabilitation is not relevant . . . because the district court\ncould not have considered that evidence at the time of the\noriginal sentencing,” 570 F. 3d, at 965 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)—would require sentencing courts cate\n——————\n   16 Indeed, some defendants will have a longer period of time between\n\ninitial custody and trial, or between trial and sentencing, and those\ndefendants—particularly if they are released on bail—will have a\ngreater opportunity to demonstrate postoffense, presentencing rehabili\ntation. Even before Booker, the lower courts uniformly held that\nevidence of such rehabilitation could provide a basis for departing from\nthe applicable Guidelines. See USSG App. C, Amdt. 602, comment.,\np. 74 (Nov. 2003) (“[D]epartures based on extraordinary post-offense\nrehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing . . . have been allowed by every\ncircuit that has ruled on the matter”).\n26               PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation,\nbut any postsentencing information, including, for exam\nple, evidence that a defendant had committed postsentenc\ning offenses. Our precedents, however, provide no basis to\nsupport such a categorical bar. See, e.g., Wasman, 468\nU. S., at 572 (“[A] sentencing authority may justify an\nincreased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant\nconduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original\nsentencing proceedings”); cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395\nU. S. 711, 723 (1969). Indeed, even the Court of Appeals\nbelow does not accept the logical consequence of its ap\nproach as it permits district courts to consider postsen\ntencing conduct that would support a higher sentence.\nSee United States v. Stapleton, 316 F. 3d 754, 757 (CA8\n2003). Nothing in §§3553(a) and 3661, however, remotely\nsuggests that Congress intended district courts to consider\nonly postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant\nwhile turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defen\ndant’s postsentencing rehabilitation. Cf. United States v.\nJones, 460 F. 3d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (“Obviously, the\ndiscretion that Booker accords sentencing judges to impose\nnon-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only\ngoes up”).\n   Finally, we note that §§3553(a)(5) and (a)(6) describe\nonly two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must\nconsider in imposing sentence. At root, amicus effectively\ninvites us to elevate two §3553(a) factors above all others.\nWe reject that invitation. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–50\n(instructing sentencing courts to “consider all of the\n§3553(a) factors” (emphasis added)).\n                             D\n  For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Court of\nAppeals erred in categorically precluding the District\nCourt from considering evidence of Pepper’s postsentenc\ning rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                27\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\non appeal. District courts post-Booker may consider evi\ndence of a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation at\nresentencing and such evidence may, in appropriate cases,\nsupport a downward variance from the advisory Guide\nlines range.17\n   The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper’s\nmotion for release pending disposition of this appeal, see\nn. 5, supra, the District Court stated that it would not\nhave exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a downward\nvariance based on postsentencing rehabilitation. That\nstatement, however, was made in light of the Court of\nAppeals’ erroneous views regarding postsentencing reha\nbilitation evidence. Because we expressly reject those\nviews today, it is unclear from the record whether the\nDistrict Court would have imposed the same sentence had\nit properly considered the extensive evidence of Pepper’s\npostsentencing rehabilitation. On remand, the District\nCourt should consider and give appropriate weight to that\nevidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning\nPepper’s conduct since his last sentencing in January\n2009. Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Circuit’s judg\nment in respect to Pepper’s sentence and remand the case\nfor resentencing consistent with this opinion.\n                            III\n  The second question presented in this case merits only a\nbrief discussion. As noted above, the original sentencing\njudge in this case granted Pepper a 40 percent downward\ndeparture pursuant to USSG §5K1.1 based on Pepper’s\n\n——————\n  17 Of course, we do not mean to imply that a district court must re\n\nduce a defendant’s sentence upon any showing of postsentencing\nrehabilitation. Nor do we mean to preclude courts of appeals from\nissuing limited remand orders, in appropriate cases, that may render\nevidence of postsentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the\nnarrow purposes of the remand proceeding. See, e.g., United States v.\nBernardo Sanchez, 569 F. 3d 995, 1000 (CA9 2009).\n28                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstantial assistance and sentenced him to 24 months’\nimprisonment. When the Court of Appeals vacated that\nsentence in Pepper II, and again in Pepper III, the case\nwas reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Reade. In\nresentencing Pepper, Chief Judge Reade ruled that she\nwas not bound by the prior sentencing judge’s decision to\ngrant a 40 percent downward departure and instead\ngranted only a 20 percent downward departure, which the\nCourt of Appeals upheld in Pepper IV. Pepper argues that\nthe law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to\napply the same 40 percent departure granted by the origi\nnal sentencing judge. We disagree.\n  Preliminarily, we note that the mandates in Pepper II\nand Pepper III were “general remand[s] for resentencing,”\nwhich “did not place any limitations on the discretion of\nthe newly assigned district court judge in resentencing\nPepper.” 570 F. 3d, at 963. In his merits briefs to this\nCourt, Pepper does not challenge the scope or validity of\nthe Court of Appeals’ mandate ordering de novo resentenc\ning, and thus has abandoned any argument that the man\ndate itself restricted the District Court from imposing a\ndifferent substantial assistance departure.18 The only\nquestion before us is whether the law of the case doctrine\nrequired Chief Judge Reade to adhere to the original\nsentencing judge’s decision granting a 40 percent down\nward departure.\n  Although we have described the “law of the case [a]s an\namorphous concept,” “[a]s most commonly defined, the\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of\nlaw, that decision should continue to govern the same\n——————\n  18 In any event, as the Court of Appeals recognized, neither Pepper II\n\nnor Pepper III held that a 40 percent downward departure was the only\nreasonable departure that a sentencing court could grant for Pepper’s\nsubstantial assistance; rather, the only issue those opinions actually\ndecided was that a “40% downward departure was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.” 570 F. 3d, at 963–964.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

This doctrine “di\nrects a court’s discretion, it does not limit the tribunal’s\npower.” Ibid. Accordingly, the doctrine “does not apply if\nthe court is ‘convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly\nerroneous and would work a manifest injustice.’ ” Agostini\nv. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting Arizona, 460\nU. S., at 618, n. 8; alteration in original).\n   Pepper argues that, because the original sentencing\njudge’s decision to grant the 40 percent departure was\nnever set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it\nconstituted the law of the case. As such, Pepper contends\nthat Chief Judge Reade should not have disturbed that\nruling absent “compelling justification” for overturning it.\nBrief for Petitioner 56. According to Pepper, because\nChief Judge Reade identified no such justification, the law\nof the case doctrine required her to adhere to the 40 per\ncent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.\n   As the Government explains, however, the Court of\nAppeals in Pepper III set aside Pepper’s entire sentence\nand remanded for a de novo resentencing. See 518 F. 3d,\nat 949, 953. Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the\noriginal sentencing court’s decision to impose a 40 percent\ndeparture was at one point law of the case, Pepper III\neffectively wiped the slate clean. To be sure, Pepper III\nvacated Pepper’s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated\nto the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does\nnot affect our conclusion. “A criminal sentence is a pack\nage of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectu\nate its sentencing intent.” United States v. Stinson, 97\nF. 3d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) (per curiam). Because a dis\ntrict court’s “original sentencing intent may be under\nmined by altering one portion of the calculus,” United\nStates v. White, 406 F. 3d 827, 832 (CA7 2005), an appel\nlate court when reversing one part of a defendant’s sen\ntence “may vacate the entire sentence . . . so that, on\n30               PEPPER v.

And, like\nthe majority, I believe that the law does not require a\nsentencing court to follow a Guideline policy statement\nthat forbids taking account of postsentencing rehabilita\ntion. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010) (USSG). I would emphasize,\nhowever, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing\ncourt free to disregard the Guidelines at will. To the\ncontrary, the law permits the court to disregard the Guide\nlines only where it is “reasonable” for a court to do so.\nBooker, supra, at 261–262; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S.\n38, 51–52 (2007); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n85, 109 (2007). And an appellate court must be guided by\nthe basic sentencing objectives of the statutes that create\nthe Guidelines in determining whether, in disregarding the\nGuidelines, the sentencing court has acted unreasonably.\n2                 PEPPER v. UNITED STATES \n\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J. \n\n\n                              I\n\n   The Guideline in question consists of a policy statement\nthat sets forth an exception to normal Guideline rules.\nNormally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to\nconsider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sen\ntence in any case “where conduct significantly differs from\nthe norm” to which “a particular guideline linguistically\napplies.” USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b) (discussing the Guide\nlines’ general approach to departures). The policy state\nment at issue is one of a handful of Guideline rules that\nnonetheless forbid departure. It says that a defendant’s\n“[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if excep\ntional, . . . are not an appropriate basis for a downward\ndeparture when resentencing.” USSG §5K2.19. The\npolicy statement thereby adds “Post-Sentencing Rehabili\ntative Efforts” to such factors as race, sex, national origin,\ncreed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guide\nlines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking\ninto account. USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).\n                                II\n    Can a sentencing court, despite this policy statement,\ntake account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the par\nticular circumstances that this case presents? I cannot\nfind the answer to this question in the language of the\nsentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the pre-\nGuidelines case of Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241\n(1949), or in this Court’s use of the word “advisory.” As\nthe majority points out, a sentencing statute forbids any\n“ ‘limitation’ ” on the “ ‘information concerning the back\nground, character, and conduct’ ” that “ ‘a court . . . may . . .\nconsider.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3661 (empha\nsis deleted)). But this provision must refer to all relevant\ninformation. See USSG §1B1.4 and comment. (generally\nincorporating §3661, but noting that there are certain\nfactors that should not be considered for any purpose). If\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthe Guideline policy statement’s absolute prohibition on\nconsideration of postsentencing rehabilitation were legally\nbinding, then information on that score (like information\nabout race, religion, sex, or national origin) would fall\noutside the scope of this provision, for it would not be\nrelevant. Thus, reference to the statute begs the question.\n   Nor can I find much help in the majority’s reference to a\nsentencing “ ‘tradition’ ” that considers “ ‘every convicted\nperson as an individual.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Koon v.\nUnited States, 518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996)). That is because\nindividualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradi\ntion. A just legal system seeks not only to treat different\ncases differently but also to treat like cases alike. Fair\nness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to\nrecognize relevant sentencing differences. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted the sentencing statutes before us, it\nfocused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing\nfailed to treat similar offenders similarly. And Congress\nwrote statutes designed primarily (though not exclusively)\nto bring about greater uniformity in sentencing. See, e.g.,\nBooker, supra, at 253–254. The statutes do so in large\npart through the creation of a system of Guidelines writ\nten by a Sentencing Commission, which Congress in\ntended the courts to follow. See Mistretta v. United States,\n488 U. S. 361 (1989) (Sentencing Commission constitu\ntional); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 348–349\n(2007); 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) (identifying relevant factors in\nsentencing, including uniformity).\n   The Williams case is similarly unhelpful. That is be\ncause Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984—the\nlaw before us—disavowed the individualized approach to\nsentencing that that case followed. Williams emphasized\nthe importance of a sentencing court’s legal power to tailor\npunishment ability to fit the circumstances of each indi\nvidual offender. 337 U. S., at 247 (emphasizing “modern\nconcepts individualizing punishment”). But Congress,\n4                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nconcerned that individualized sentencing had gone too far,\nwrote a new sentencing law designed to help correct “dis\nparities” among similar defendants sentenced by different\njudges. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 45 (1983) (“Sentencing\ndisparities” are “unfair both to offenders and to the pub\nlic”); id., at 38 (disparities “can be traced directly to the\nunfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and\nparole authorities responsible for imposing and imple\nmenting the sentence”).\n   Booker’s description of the Guidelines as “advisory”\noffers somewhat greater assistance—but only if that word\nis read in light of the Sixth Amendment analysis that\nprecedes it. This Court has held that the Sixth Amend\nment forbids Congress (through the Commission) to create\nGuidelines that both (1) require judges (without juries) to\nfind sentencing facts and also (2) tie those facts to the\nmandatory imposition of particular sentences. 543 U. S.,\nat 226, 244; see also Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490 (Sixth\nAmendment requires jury findings in respect to factual\nmatters that require judge to increase sentence); Blakely\nv. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 303–304 (2004) (same in\nrespect to a State’s mandatory guidelines). In light of this\nSixth Amendment prohibition, the Court, believing that\nCongress would not have intended to introduce new juries\ninto each sentencing proceeding, excised the few particular\nprovisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that\napplication of the Guidelines was mandatory. Booker, 543\nU. S., at 259. The Court believed that the relevant stat\nutes remained workable without those few provisions, that\ntheir excision could further Congress’ basic sentencing\nintentions, and that excision was more likely to do so than\ninvalidation of the entire statutory scheme. With an\noccasional exception (such as the statutory provision we\nstrike down today), there is no reason to think that the\nsentencing statutes as limited in Booker run afoul of\nthe Sixth Amendment. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   Booker made clear that the remaining statutory provi\nsions, while leading us to call the Guidelines “advisory”\n(rather than “mandatory”), do not give a sentencing judge\ncarte blanche to apply, or not to apply, the Guidelines as\nthat judge chooses. Rather, the “district courts, while not\nbound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guide\nlines and take them into account when sentencing.” Id., at\n264. Moreover, Booker held that appellate court review of\nsentencing is valid. Booker explained that the “statutory\nlanguage, the structure of the [Sentencing Reform Act],\nand the sound administration of justice,” taken together,\nrequire appellate courts to apply “reasonableness stan\ndard[s]” of review. Id., at 260–261, 262 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Reasonableness standards, we added, are\n“not foreign to sentencing law.” Id., at 262. And the “Act\nhas long required their use in important sentencing cir\ncumstances—both on review of departures . . . and on\nreview of sentences imposed where there was no applica\nble Guideline.” Ibid. See also id., at 261 (appellate courts\nwill apply “a practical standard of review already familiar\nto appellate courts: review for ‘unreasonable[ness]’ ”); id.,\nat 264 (“[C]ourts of appeals” will “review sentencing deci\nsions for unreasonableness”).\n   We have also indicated that, in applying reasonableness\nstandards, the appellate courts should take account of\nsentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and Guide\nlines, as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and\nappellate courts. Thus, in Kimbrough, we observed that in\nlight of the “discrete institutional strengths” of the Sen\ntencing Commission and sentencing judges, “a district\ncourt’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may\nattract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case ‘outside the “heartland” to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply.’ ” 552\nU. S., at 109 (quoting Rita, supra, at 351). We noted,\nhowever, that “while the Guidelines are no longer binding,\n6                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncloser review may be in order when the sentencing judge\nvaries from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view\nthat the Guidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a)\nconsiderations’ even in a mine-run case.” 552 U. S., at\n109.\n                             III\n   Unlike the majority, I would decide the question\nKimbrough left open. And I would follow its suggested\nframework for evaluating “reasonableness.” As Kim\nbrough suggests, doing so takes proper account of the\ncomparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate\ncourts, and the Sentencing Commission. The trial court\ntypically better understands the individual circumstances\nof particular cases before it, while the Commission has\ncomparatively greater ability to gather information, to\nconsider a broader national picture, to compare sentences\nattaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write\nmore coherent overall standards that reflect nationally\nuniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.\n   Applying Kimbrough’s suggested framework, I would\nreason very much as does the majority. The first question\nis whether a sentencing judge might sometimes take ac\ncount of a (resentenced) offender’s postsentencing rehabili\ntation—despite a Guideline policy statement that says\nnever. I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to\ndisregard the Guidelines’ absolute prohibition, despite the\nCommission’s comparatively greater policy-formation\nabilities. That is because the Guideline policy statement\nitself runs counter to ordinary Guideline sentencing policy,\nwhich rarely forbids departures and then for very strong\npolicy reasons. Supra, at 2. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).\n   The Commission offers no convincing justification for\ncreating this exception with respect to postsentencing\nrehabilitation. The Commission’s commentary says that\nfor a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nreason (reflecting good behavior while the case is on ap\npeal) would conflict with the use of other mechanisms,\nsuch as “good-time” credits, for that purpose. But how is\nthat so? A defendant, after sentencing but while his case\nis on appeal, may or may not be entitled to “good time.”\nThat may depend upon whether he remains on bail or\nupon particular “good-time” rules. Regardless, the resen\ntencing judge can take account of any such matter. See\nalso ante, at 26–28.\n   The Commission’s commentary also suggests it would be\ninequitable to allow an offender who is being resentenced\nto receive any kind of credit for his good behavior, say\nwhile his case was on appeal. But why is that so? After\nall, the Guidelines permit a judge to take account of an\noffender’s good behavior after arrest but before initial\nsentencing. That time period could last longer than the\ntime taken up on appeal. Why should pretrial behavior\ncount but appeal time behavior not count? Like the major\nity, I find this justification for the policy statement uncon\nvincing. See ante, at 25–26.\n   The second question is whether, given the sentencing\ncourt’s power to disregard the policy statement forbidding\ndepartures based on postsentencing rehabilitation, the\nfacts and circumstances here could warrant a departure\n(or variance) for that reason. And the answer, in my view,\nis yes. This case presents unusual rehabilitative circum\nstances. As the majority observes: “By the time of his\nsecond resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free\nfor nearly five years, had attended college and achieved\nhigh grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a\npromotion, had reestablished a relationship with his\nfather, and was married and supporting his wife’s daugh\nter.” Ante, at 14. These are case-specific facts and cir\ncumstances, and they are of the kind that should lead\nappellate courts to show their “greatest respect” for a\nsentencing decision, including a departure or variance,\n8                PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat rests upon them.\n                              IV\n   In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted\nthem, require courts of appeals to review sentences for\nreasonableness, including sentences that depart or vary\nfrom a specific Guideline. The appellate courts should\nreview those decisions more closely when they rest upon\ndisagreement with Guidelines policy. Kimbrough, 552\nU. S., at 109. They should review those decisions with\ngreater deference when they rest upon case-specific cir\ncumstances that place the case outside a specific Guide\nline’s “heartland.” See ibid.; Rita, 551 U. S., at 351; Koon,\n518 U. S., at 98–99.\n   By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we\ncan remain faithful to Congress’ basic intent in writing\nthem—despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions\nthat conflict with the Sixth Amendment. The statutes\ncreate a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop\nsentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines. The Guide\nlines are to further the statutes’ basic objective, namely\ngreater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account\nof special individual circumstances, primarily by permit\nting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases. By\ncollecting trial courts’ reasons for departure (or variance),\nby examining appellate court reactions, by developing\nstatistical and other empirical information, by considering\nthe views of expert penologists and others, the Commis\nsion can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See USSG ch.\n1, pt. A1, §3. Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Com\nmission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an\niterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a\nmore uniform and a more equitable sentencing system.\nSee id., at 1–15. I would interpret the statutes before us\naccordingly.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

I agree with\nthe Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on\nthe basis of 18 U. S. C. §3742(g), as amicus suggests. This\nprovision was designed to function as part of the manda\ntory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265 (2005).\nAlthough amicus’ argument is ingenious, even the sort of\nsurgery sanctioned in Booker cannot transform this provi\nsion into one that can survive in the post-Booker world.\n  I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it holds\nthat the decision below regarding evidence of postsentenc\ning rehabilitation must be reversed. That decision, which\nentirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was\nconsistent with the policy statement in §5K2.19 of the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines, but “[t]he Booker\nremedial decision . . . does not permit a court of appeals\nto treat the Guidelines’ policy decisions as binding.”\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 116 (2007)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting).\n  Under Booker, however, district judges are still required\nin almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy\ndecisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\nSee 552 U. S., at 116; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38,\n61–67 (2007) (ALITO, J., dissenting). Congress delegated\n2                    PEPPER v.

C. §§3553(a)(4), (5), and requiring judges to give\nsignificant weight to the Commission’s policy decisions\ndoes not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the\nmandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, i.e.,\nthe right to have a jury make certain factual findings that\nare relevant to sentencing.\n   While I continue to believe that sentencing judges\nshould be required to give significant weight to all Guide\nlines provisions and policy statements, see Kimbrough,\n552 U. S., at 116 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the Court in\nKimbrough held that sentencing judges may not be re\nquired to give weight to some unusual policy decisions, see\nid., at 109–110 (majority opinion). And JUSTICE BREYER\nnow makes a reasonable case that the particular policy\nstatement involved in this case is distinguishable from\nalmost all of the other rules that the Commission has\nadopted. See ante, p. ___ (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). His position seems to me more\nconsistent with Kimbrough than the Court’s. It would at\nleast prevent us from sliding all the way down the slippery\nslope that leads back to the regime of entirely discretion\nary federal sentencing that preceded the enactment of the\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.\n   Anyone familiar with the history of criminal sentencing\nin this country cannot fail to see the irony in the Court’s\npraise for the sentencing scheme exemplified by Williams\nv. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), and 18 U. S. C. §3661.*\n——————\n   * Insofar as 18 U. S. C. §3661 permitted a sentencing judge to con\nsider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision was\neffectively modified by the subsequent enactment of the Sentencing\nReform Act, which instructed the Sentencing Commission to adopt\nguidelines and policy statements that avoid “unwarranted sentencing\ndisparities,” 28 U. S. C. §991(b)(1)(B); see also §994(f), and which\nprovided that sentencing courts “shall consider . . . any pertinent policy\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)       3\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nBy the time of the enactment of the Sentencing Reform\nAct in 1984, this scheme had fallen into widespread disre\npute. See, e.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n366 (1989) (noting “[f]undamental and widespread dissat\nisfaction with the uncertainties and the disparities” of this\nscheme); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 142\n(1980) (“It has been observed . . . that sentencing is one of\nthe areas of the criminal justice system most in need of\nreform”); S. Rep. No. 98–223, p. 62 (1983) (“The shameful\ndisparity in criminal sentences is a major flaw in the\nexisting criminal justice system”). Under this system,\neach federal district judge was free to implement his or\nher individual sentencing philosophy, and therefore the\nsentence imposed in a particular case often depended\nheavily on the spin of the wheel that determined the judge\nto whom the case was assigned. See Bullington v. Mis\nsouri, 451 U. S. 430, 444, n. 16 (1981) (“There has been no\nattempt to separate policymaking from individual sentenc\ning determinations” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nM. Frankel, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order 5\n(1973) (“[T]he almost wholly unchecked and sweeping\npowers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are\nterrifying and intolerable for a society that professes\ndevotion to the rule of law”).\n   Some language in today’s opinion reads like a paean to\nthat old regime, and I fear that it may be interpreted as\nsanctioning a move back toward the system that prevailed\nprior to 1984. If that occurs, I suspect that the day will\ncome when the irrationality of that system is once again\nseen, and perhaps then the entire Booker line of cases will\nbe reexamined.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nstatement,” 18 U.

As written, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\ndo not permit district courts to impose a sentence below\nthe Guidelines range based on the defendant’s postsen\ntencing rehabilitation.1 See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010)\n(USSG). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265\n(2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme\nadvisory, a remedy that was “far broader than necessary\nto correct constitutional error.” Kimbrough v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 85, 114 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nBecause there is “no principled way to apply the Booker\nremedy,” I have explained that it is “best to apply the\nstatute as written, including 18 U. S.

Id., at 116; see\nBooker, supra, at 313–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in\npart); Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 61 (2007) (THO-\nMAS, J., dissenting); Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.

See ante, at 29–31.\n2                  PEPPER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecause doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment.\nThe constitutional problem arises only when a judge\nmakes “a finding that raises the sentence beyond the\nsentence that could have lawfully been imposed by refer\nence to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defen\ndant.” Booker, supra, at 313 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nPepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement\nwith between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine\nmixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(viii).2 United States v. Pepper,\n412 F. 3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). Because Pepper has ad\nmitted facts that would support a much longer sentence\nthan the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amend\nment problem in this case.\n   Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper’s sen\ntence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated\nthe Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG §5K1.1 depar\nture and the Government’s motion under Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month\nsentence. Guideline §5K2.19 expressly prohibits down\nward departures based on “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative\nefforts, even if exceptional.” Nor is there any provision in\nthe Guidelines for the “variance” Pepper seeks, as such\nvariances are creations of the Booker remedy. I would\ntherefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold\nPepper’s sentence.\n   Although this outcome would not represent my own\npolicy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress\nand the Federal Sentencing Commission.
