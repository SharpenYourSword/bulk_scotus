PHELPS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u2013751.     Argued October 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 2, 2011\nFor the past 20 years, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church\n  has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that God\n  hates the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particu\n  larly in America\u2019s military. The church\u2019s picketing has also con\n  demned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy. Fred\n  Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishion\n  ers (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral\n  of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in\n  the line of duty. The picketing took place on public land approxi\n  mately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in ac\n  cordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers. The\n  picketers peacefully displayed their signs\u2014stating, e.g., \u201cThank God\n  for Dead Soldiers,\u201d \u201cFags Doom Nations,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d\n  \u201cPriests Rape Boys,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell\u201d\u2014for about 30 min\n  utes before the funeral began. Matthew Snyder\u2019s father (Snyder), pe\n  titioner here, saw the tops of the picketers\u2019 signs when driving to the\n  funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watch\n  ing a news broadcast later that night.\n     Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughters\u2014who\n  participated in the picketing\u2014and the church (collectively Westboro)\n  alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of\n  emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy. A\n  jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and\n  punitive damages. Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly exces\n  sive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the\n  First Amendment fully protected its speech. The District Court re\n  duced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise in\n  tact. The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboro\u2019s state\n2                         SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ments were entitled to First Amendment protection because those\n    statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably\n    false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.\nHeld: The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its\n picketing in this case. Pp. 5\u201315.\n    (a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment can serve as a\n defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of\n emotional distress. Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46,\n 50-51. Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro li\n able for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is\n of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances\n of the case. \u201c[S]peech on public issues occupies the \u2018 \u201chighest rung of\n the hierarchy of First Amendment values\u201d \u2019 and is entitled to special\n protection.\u201d Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145. Although the\n boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern\n are not well defined, this Court has said that speech is of public con\n cern when it can \u201cbe fairly considered as relating to any matter of po\n litical, social, or other concern to the community,\u201d id., at 146, or when\n it \u201cis a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the\n public,\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83\u201384. A statement\u2019s argua\n bly \u201cinappropriate or controversial character . . . is irrelevant to the\n question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.\u201d Rankin v.\n McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387. Pp. 5\u20137.\n    To determine whether speech is of public or private concern, this\n Court must independently examine the \u201c \u2018content, form, and con\n text,\u2019 \u201d of the speech \u201c \u2018as revealed by the whole record.\u2019 \u201d Dun &\n Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 761. In\n considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it\n is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    The \u201ccontent\u201d of Westboro\u2019s signs plainly relates to public, rather\n than private, matters. The placards highlighted issues of public im\n port\u2014the political and moral conduct of the United States and its\n citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and\n scandals involving the Catholic clergy\u2014and Westboro conveyed its\n views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public\n audience as possible. Even if a few of the signs were viewed as con\n taining messages related to a particular individual, that would not\n change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboro\u2019s demonstra\n tion spoke to broader public issues. P. 8.\n    The \u201ccontext\u201d of the speech\u2014its connection with Matthew Snyder\u2019s\n funeral\u2014cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro\u2019s speech.\n The signs reflected Westboro\u2019s condemnation of much in modern soci\n ety, and it cannot be argued that Westboro\u2019s use of speech on public\n issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nSnyder from liability. Westboro had been actively engaged in speak\ning on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became\naware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the\npicketing did not represent Westboro\u2019s honestly held beliefs on public\nissues. Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase\npublicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly\nhurtful to Snyder. That does not mean that its speech should be af\nforded less than full First Amendment protection under the circum\nstances of this case. Pp. 8\u201310.\n   That said, \u201c \u2018[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all\nplaces and at all times.\u2019 \u201d Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 479.\nWestboro\u2019s choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not\nbeyond the Government\u2019s regulatory reach\u2014it is \u201csubject to reason\nable time, place, or manner restrictions.\u201d Clark v. Community for\nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293. The facts here are quite\ndifferent, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated\nand the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited\nsituations where the Court has concluded that the location of tar\ngeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed\ncontent neutral. Frisby, supra, at 477; Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health\nCenter, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 768, distinguished. Maryland now has a\nlaw restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the\ntime of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider\nwhether that law is a \u201creasonable time, place, or manner restric\ntio[n]\u201d under the standards announced by this Court. Clark, supra,\nat 293. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   The \u201cspecial protection\u201d afforded to what Westboro said, in the\nwhole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome\nby a jury finding that the picketing was \u201coutrageous\u201d for purposes of\napplying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional dis\ntress. That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish\nWestboro for its views on matters of public concern. For all these\nreasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for inten\ntional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   (b) Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclu\nsion. He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his\nson\u2019s funeral, but the captive audience doctrine\u2014which has been ap\nplied sparingly, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736\u2013\n738; Frisby, supra, at 484\u2013485\u2014should not be expanded to the cir\ncumstances here. Westboro stayed well away from the memorial ser\nvice, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers\u2019 signs,\nand there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the fu\nneral service itself. Pp. 13\u201314.\n   (c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for in\n4                          SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclu\n    sion\u2014the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accom\n    plish\u2014Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those\n    torts. P. 14.\n      (d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public prop\n    erty, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of lo\n    cal officials. It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder\u2019s funeral, and its\n    choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its\n    speech. Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful\n    speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled,\n    Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this\n    case.

The picket signs reflected the\nchurch\u2019s view that the United States is overly tolerant of\nsin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment.\nThe question presented is whether the First Amendment\nshields the church members from tort liability for their\nspeech in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in\nTopeka, Kansas, in 1955. The church\u2019s congregation\nbelieves that God hates and punishes the United States\nfor its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in Amer\nica\u2019s military. The church frequently communicates its\nviews by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more\nthan 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have\npublicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600\nfunerals. Brief for Rutherford Institute as Amicus Curiae\n7, n. 14.\n2                    SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in\nIraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder\u2019s father\nselected the Catholic church in the Snyders\u2019 hometown of\nWestminster, Maryland, as the site for his son\u2019s funeral.\nLocal newspapers provided notice of the time and location\nof the service.\n   Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral and\ndecided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro\nBaptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of\nhis grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial\nservice, the Westboro congregation members picketed on\npublic land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland\nState House, the United States Naval Academy, and\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s funeral. The Westboro picketers car\nried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.\nThey stated, for instance: \u201cGod Hates the USA/Thank God\nfor 9/11,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Pray for the USA,\u201d\n\u201cThank God for IEDs,\u201d \u201cThank God for Dead Soldiers,\u201d\n\u201cPope in Hell,\u201d \u201cPriests Rape Boys,\u201d \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell,\u201d and \u201cGod Hates You.\u201d\n   The church had notified the authorities in advance of its\nintent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picket\ners complied with police instructions in staging their\ndemonstration. The picketing took place within a 10- by\n25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street,\nbehind a temporary fence. App. to Brief for Appellants\nin No. 08\u20131026 (CA4), pp. 2282\u20132285 (hereinafter App.).\nThat plot was approximately 1,000 feet from the church\nwhere the funeral was held. Several buildings separated\nthe picket site from the church. Id., at 3758. The West\nboro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes\nbefore the funeral began and sang hymns and recited\nBible verses. None of the picketers entered church prop\nerty or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or use\nprofanity, and there was no violence associated with the\npicketing.

S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  The funeral procession passed within 200 to 300 feet of\nthe picket site. Although Snyder testified that he could\nsee the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral,\nhe did not see what was written on the signs until later\nthat night, while watching a news broadcast covering the\nevent. Id., at 2084\u20132086.1\n                              B\n   Snyder filed suit against Phelps, Phelps\u2019s daughters,\nand the Westboro Baptist Church (collectively Westboro or\nthe church) in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Maryland under that court\u2019s diversity jurisdic\ntion. Snyder alleged five state tort law claims: defama\ntion, publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil\nconspiracy.     Westboro moved for summary judgment\ncontending, in part, that the church\u2019s speech was insu\nlated from liability by the First Amendment. See 533\nF. Supp. 2d 567, 570 (Md. 2008).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 A few weeks after the funeral, one of the picketers posted a message\n\non Westboro\u2019s Web site discussing the picketing and containing relig\niously oriented denunciations of the Snyders, interspersed among\nlengthy Bible quotations. Snyder discovered the posting, referred to by\nthe parties as the \u201cepic,\u201d during an Internet search for his son\u2019s name.\nThe epic is not properly before us and does not factor in our analysis.\nAlthough the epic was submitted to the jury and discussed in the courts\nbelow, Snyder never mentioned it in his petition for certiorari. See Pet.\nfor Cert. i (\u201cSnyder\u2019s claim arose out of Phelps\u2019 intentional acts at\nSnyder\u2019s son\u2019s funeral\u201d (emphasis added)); this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(g)\n(petition must contain statement \u201csetting out the facts material to\nconsideration of the question presented\u201d). Nor did Snyder respond to\nthe statement in the opposition to certiorari that \u201c[t]hough the epic was\nasserted as a basis for the claims at trial, the petition . . . appears to be\naddressing only claims based on the picketing.\u201d Brief in Opposition 9.\nSnyder devoted only one paragraph in the argument section of his\nopening merits brief to the epic. Given the foregoing and the fact that\nan Internet posting may raise distinct issues in this context, we decline\nto consider the epic in deciding this case. See Ontario v. Quon, 560\nU. S. ___, ___ \u2013 ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10\u201312).\n4                        SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court awarded Westboro summary judg\nment on Snyder\u2019s claims for defamation and publicity\ngiven to private life, concluding that Snyder could not\nprove the necessary elements of those torts. Id., at 572\u2013\n573. A trial was held on the remaining claims. At trial,\nSnyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.\nHe testified that he is unable to separate the thought of\nhis dead son from his thoughts of Westboro\u2019s picketing,\nand that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill\nwhen he thinks about it. Id., at 588\u2013589. Expert wit\nnesses testified that Snyder\u2019s emotional anguish had\nresulted in severe depression and had exacerbated pre\nexisting health conditions.\n   A jury found for Snyder on the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil\nconspiracy claims, and held Westboro liable for $2.9 mil\nlion in compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive\ndamages. Westboro filed several post-trial motions, in\ncluding a motion contending that the jury verdict was\ngrossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a\nmatter of law on all claims on First Amendment grounds.\nThe District Court remitted the punitive damages award\nto $2.1 million, but left the jury verdict otherwise intact.\nId., at 597.\n   In the Court of Appeals, Westboro\u2019s primary argument\nwas that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law because the First Amendment fully protected West\nboro\u2019s speech. The Court of Appeals agreed. 580 F. 3d\n206, 221 (CA4 2009). The court reviewed the picket signs\nand concluded that Westboro\u2019s statements were entitled to\nFirst Amendment protection because those statements\nwere on matters of public concern, were not provably false,\nand were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.\nId., at 222\u2013224.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 One judge concurred in the judgment on the ground that Snyder had\n\nfailed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to support a jury verdict\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n   To succeed on a claim for intentional infliction of emo\ntional distress in Maryland, a plaintiff must demonstrate\nthat the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in\nextreme and outrageous conduct that caused the plaintiff\nto suffer severe emotional distress. See Harris v. Jones,\n281 Md. 560, 565\u2013566, 380 A. 2d 611, 614 (1977). The\nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment\u2014\u201cCongress\nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech\u201d\u2014\ncan serve as a defense in state tort suits, including suits\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress. See, e.g.,\nHustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 50\u201351\n(1988).3\n   Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding West\nboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on\nwhether that speech is of public or private concern, as\ndetermined by all the circumstances of the case. \u201c[S]peech\non \u2018matters of public concern\u2019 . . . is \u2018at the heart of the\nFirst Amendment\u2019s protection.\u2019 \u201d Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.\nGreenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.

The First Amend\nment reflects \u201ca profound national commitment to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\non any of his tort claims. 580 F. 3d, at 227 (opinion of Shedd, J.). The\nCourt of Appeals majority determined that the picketers had \u201cvoluntar\nily waived\u201d any such contention on appeal. Id., at 216.

But, as the court below noted, there is \u201cno\nsuggestion that the speech at issue falls within one of the categorical\nexclusions from First Amendment protection, such as those for obscen\nity or \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d 580 F. 3d, at 218, n. 12; see United States v.\nStevens, 559 U.

Hustler, supra, at 56 (quoting Dun &\nBradstreet, supra, at 758); see Connick, supra, at 145\u2013147.\nThat is because restricting speech on purely private mat\nters does not implicate the same constitutional concerns\nas limiting speech on matters of public interest: \u201c[T]here is\nno threat to the free and robust debate of public issues;\nthere is no potential interference with a meaningful dia\nlogue of ideas\u201d; and the \u201cthreat of liability\u201d does not pose\nthe risk of \u201ca reaction of self-censorship\u201d on matters of\npublic import. Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 760 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  We noted a short time ago, in considering whether\npublic employee speech addressed a matter of public con\ncern, that \u201cthe boundaries of the public concern test are\nnot well defined.\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83\n(2004) (per curiam). Although that remains true today, we\nhave articulated some guiding principles, principles that\naccord broad protection to speech to ensure that courts\nthemselves do not become inadvertent censors.\n  Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can\n\u201cbe fairly considered as relating to any matter of politi-\ncal, social, or other concern to the community,\u201d Connick,\nsupra, at 146, or when it \u201cis a subject of legitimate news\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The arguably \u201cinappropriate or controversial\ncharacter of a statement is irrelevant to the question\nwhether it deals with a matter of public concern.\u201d Rankin\nv. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387 (1987).\n   Our opinion in Dun & Bradstreet, on the other hand,\nprovides an example of speech of only private concern. In\nthat case we held, as a general matter, that information\nabout a particular individual\u2019s credit report \u201cconcerns no\npublic issue.\u201d 472 U. S., at 762. The content of the report,\nwe explained, \u201cwas speech solely in the individual interest\nof the speaker and its specific business audience.\u201d Ibid.\nThat was confirmed by the fact that the particular report\nwas sent to only five subscribers to the reporting service,\nwho were bound not to disseminate it further. Ibid. To\ncite another example, we concluded in San Diego v. Roe\nthat, in the context of a government employer regulating\nthe speech of its employees, videos of an employee engag\ning in sexually explicit acts did not address a public con\ncern; the videos \u201cdid nothing to inform the public about\nany aspect of the [employing agency\u2019s] functioning or\noperation.\u201d 543 U. S., at 84.\n   Deciding whether speech is of public or private concern\nrequires us to examine the \u201c \u2018content, form, and context\u2019 \u201d\nof that speech, \u201c \u2018as revealed by the whole record.\u2019 \u201d Dun &\nBradstreet, supra, at 761 (quoting Connick, supra, at 147\u2013\n148). As in other First Amendment cases, the court is\nobligated \u201cto \u2018make an independent examination of the\nwhole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment\ndoes not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of\nfree expression.\u2019 \u201d Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\nUnited States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984) (quoting New\nYork Times, supra, at 284\u2013286). In considering content,\n8                    SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nform, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is neces\nsary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, in\ncluding what was said, where it was said, and how it was\nsaid.\n   The \u201ccontent\u201d of Westboro\u2019s signs plainly relates to\nbroad issues of interest to society at large, rather than\nmatters of \u201cpurely private concern.\u201d Dun & Bradstreet,\nsupra, at 759.       The placards read \u201cGod Hates the\nUSA/Thank God for 9/11,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t\nPray for the USA,\u201d \u201cThank God for IEDs,\u201d \u201cFag Troops,\u201d\n\u201cSemper Fi Fags,\u201d \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d \u201cMaryland Taliban,\u201d\n\u201cFags Doom Nations,\u201d \u201cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\u201d \u201cThank\nGod for Dead Soldiers,\u201d \u201cPope in Hell,\u201d \u201cPriests Rape\nBoys,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell,\u201d and \u201cGod Hates You.\u201d App.\n3781\u20133787. While these messages may fall short of\nrefined social or political commentary, the issues they\nhighlight\u2014the political and moral conduct of the United\nStates and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexual\nity in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic\nclergy\u2014are matters of public import. The signs certainly\nconvey Westboro\u2019s position on those issues, in a manner\ndesigned, unlike the private speech in Dun & Bradstreet,\nto reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even\nif a few of the signs\u2014such as \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell\u201d and\n\u201cGod Hates You\u201d\u2014were viewed as containing messages\nrelated to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically,\nthat would not change the fact that the overall thrust and\ndominant theme of Westboro\u2019s demonstration spoke to\nbroader public issues.\n   Apart from the content of Westboro\u2019s signs, Snyder\ncontends that the \u201ccontext\u201d of the speech\u2014its connection\nwith his son\u2019s funeral\u2014makes the speech a matter of\nprivate rather than public concern. The fact that West\nboro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot\nby itself transform the nature of Westboro\u2019s speech.\nWestboro\u2019s signs, displayed on public land next to a public\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstreet, reflect the fact that the church finds much to con\ndemn in modern society. Its speech is \u201cfairly characterized\nas constituting speech on a matter of public concern,\u201d\nConnick, 461 U. S., at 146, and the funeral setting does\nnot alter that conclusion.\n   Snyder argues that the church members in fact mounted\na personal attack on Snyder and his family, and then\nattempted to \u201cimmunize their conduct by claiming that\nthey were actually protesting the United States\u2019 tolerance\nof homosexuality or the supposed evils of the Catholic\nChurch.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 10. We are not con\ncerned in this case that Westboro\u2019s speech on public mat\nters was in any way contrived to insulate speech on a\nprivate matter from liability. Westboro had been actively\nengaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its pick\neting long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and\nthere can be no serious claim that Westboro\u2019s picketing\ndid not represent its \u201chonestly believed\u201d views on public\nissues. Garrison, 379 U. S., at 73. There was no pre\nexisting relationship or conflict between Westboro and\nSnyder that might suggest Westboro\u2019s speech on public\nmatters was intended to mask an attack on Snyder over a\nprivate matter. Contrast Connick, supra, at 153 (finding\npublic employee speech a matter of private concern when\nit was \u201cno coincidence that [the speech] followed upon the\nheels of [a] transfer notice\u201d affecting the employee).\n   Snyder goes on to argue that Westboro\u2019s speech should\nbe afforded less than full First Amendment protection \u201cnot\nonly because of the words\u201d but also because the church\nmembers exploited the funeral \u201cas a platform to bring\ntheir message to a broader audience.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n44, 40. There is no doubt that Westboro chose to stage its\npicketing at the Naval Academy, the Maryland State\nHouse, and Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral to increase publicity\nfor its views and because of the relation between those\nsites and its views\u2014in the case of the military funeral,\n10                       SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause Westboro believes that God is killing American\nsoldiers as punishment for the Nation\u2019s sinful policies.\n  Westboro\u2019s choice to convey its views in conjunction with\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s funeral made the expression of those\nviews particularly hurtful to many, especially to Mat\nthew\u2019s father. The record makes clear that the applicable\nlegal term\u2014\u201cemotional distress\u201d\u2014fails to capture fully the\nanguish Westboro\u2019s choice added to Mr. Snyder\u2019s already\nincalculable grief. But Westboro conducted its picketing\npeacefully on matters of public concern at a public place\nadjacent to a public street. Such space occupies a \u201cspecial\nposition in terms of First Amendment protection.\u201d United\nStates v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983). \u201c[W]e have\nrepeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a\ntraditional public forum,\u201d noting that \u201c \u2018[t]ime out of mind\u2019\npublic streets and sidewalks have been used for public\nassembly and debate.\u201d Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474,\n480 (1988).4\n  That said, \u201c[e]ven protected speech is not equally per\nmissible in all places and at all times.\u201d Id., at 479 (quot\ning Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 788, 799 (1985)). Westboro\u2019s choice of where and\nwhen to conduct its picketing is not beyond the Govern\nment\u2019s regulatory reach\u2014it is \u201csubject to reasonable time,\nplace, or manner restrictions\u201d that are consistent with the\nstandards announced in this Court\u2019s precedents. Clark v.\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293\n(1984). Maryland now has a law imposing restrictions on\nfuneral picketing, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a710\u2013205\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent is wrong to suggest that the Court considers a public\nstreet \u201ca free-fire zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are\nshielded from liability.\u201d Post, at 10\u201311. The fact that Westboro con\nducted its picketing adjacent to a public street does not insulate the\nspeech from liability, but instead heightens concerns that what is at\nissue is an effort to communicate to the public the church\u2019s views on\nmatters of public concern. That is why our precedents so clearly\nrecognize the special significance of this traditional public forum.\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(Lexis Supp. 2010), as do 43 other States and the Federal\nGovernment. See Brief for American Legion as Amicus\nCuriae 18\u201319, n. 2 (listing statutes). To the extent these\nlaws are content neutral, they raise very different ques\ntions from the tort verdict at issue in this case. Mary\nland\u2019s law, however, was not in effect at the time of the\nevents at issue here, so we have no occasion to consider\nhow it might apply to facts such as those before us, or\nwhether it or other similar regulations are constitutional.5\n   We have identified a few limited situations where the\nlocation of targeted picketing can be regulated under\nprovisions that the Court has determined to be content\nneutral. In Frisby, for example, we upheld a ban on such\npicketing \u201cbefore or about\u201d a particular residence, 487\nU. S., at 477. In Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc.,\nwe approved an injunction requiring a buffer zone between\nprotesters and an abortion clinic entrance. 512 U. S. 753,\n768 (1994). The facts here are obviously quite different,\nboth with respect to the activity being regulated and the\nmeans of restricting those activities.\n   Simply put, the church members had the right to be\nwhere they were. Westboro alerted local authorities to its\nfuneral protest and fully complied with police guidance on\nwhere the picketing could be staged. The picketing was\nconducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from\nthe church, out of the sight of those at the church. The\nprotest was not unruly; there was no shouting, profanity,\nor violence.\n   The record confirms that any distress occasioned by\nWestboro\u2019s picketing turned on the content and viewpoint\nof the message conveyed, rather than any interference\nwith the funeral itself. A group of parishioners standing\nat the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Maryland law prohibits picketing within 100 feet of a funeral\n\nservice or funeral procession; Westboro\u2019s picketing would have complied\nwith that restriction.\n12                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsaid \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and \u201cGod Loves You,\u201d would not\nhave been subjected to liability. It was what Westboro\nsaid that exposed it to tort damages.\n   Given that Westboro\u2019s speech was at a public place on a\nmatter of public concern, that speech is entitled to \u201cspecial\nprotection\u201d under the First Amendment. Such speech\ncannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or\narouses contempt. \u201cIf there is a bedrock principle underly\ning the First Amendment, it is that the government may\nnot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because\nsociety finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989). Indeed, \u201cthe\npoint of all speech protection . . . is to shield just those\nchoices of content that in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or\neven hurtful.\u201d Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and\nBisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 574 (1995).\n   The jury here was instructed that it could hold Westboro\nliable for intentional infliction of emotional distress based\non a finding that Westboro\u2019s picketing was \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cOutrageousness,\u201d however, is a highly malleable standard\nwith \u201can inherent subjectiveness about it which would\nallow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors\u2019\ntastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a\nparticular expression.\u201d Hustler, 485 U. S., at 55 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In a case such as this, a jury is\n\u201cunlikely to be neutral with respect to the content of [the]\nspeech,\u201d posing \u201ca real danger of becoming an instrument\nfor the suppression of . . . \u2018vehement, caustic, and some\ntimes unpleasan[t]\u2019 \u201d expression. Bose Corp., 466 U. S., at\n510 (quoting New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270).

The\nCourt of Appeals did not examine these torts independ\nently of the intentional infliction of emotional distress tort.\nInstead, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\nwholesale, holding that the judgment wrongly \u201cattache[d]\ntort liability to constitutionally protected speech.\u201d 580\nF. 3d, at 226.\n  Snyder argues that even assuming Westboro\u2019s speech\nis entitled to First Amendment protection generally, the\nchurch is not immunized from liability for intrusion upon\nseclusion because Snyder was a member of a captive audi\nence at his son\u2019s funeral. Brief for Petitioner 45\u201346. We\ndo not agree. In most circumstances, \u201cthe Constitution\ndoes not permit the government to decide which types of\notherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to\nrequire protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.\nRather, . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to\navoid further bombardment of [his] sensibilities simply by\naverting [his] eyes.\u201d Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S.\n205, 210\u2013211 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAs a result, \u201c[t]he ability of government, consonant with\nthe Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect\nothers from hearing it is . . . dependent upon a showing\nthat substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an\nessentially intolerable manner.\u201d Cohen v. California, 403\nU. S. 15, 21 (1971).\n  As a general matter, we have applied the captive audi\n14                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nence doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners\nfrom protected speech. For example, we have upheld a\nstatute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of\noffensive mail to his home, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept.,\n397 U. S. 728, 736\u2013738 (1970), and an ordinance prohibit\ning picketing \u201cbefore or about\u201d any individual\u2019s residence,\nFrisby, 487 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\n   Here, Westboro stayed well away from the memorial\nservice. Snyder could see no more than the tops of the\nsigns when driving to the funeral. And there is no indica\ntion that the picketing in any way interfered with the\nfuneral service itself. We decline to expand the captive\naudience doctrine to the circumstances presented here.\n   Because we find that the First Amendment bars Snyder\nfrom recovery for intentional infliction of emotional dis\ntress or intrusion upon seclusion\u2014the alleged unlawful\nactivity Westboro conspired to accomplish\u2014we must\nlikewise hold that Snyder cannot recover for civil conspir\nacy based on those torts.\n                              IV\n   Our holding today is narrow. We are required in First\nAmendment cases to carefully review the record, and the\nreach of our opinion here is limited by the particular facts\nbefore us. As we have noted, \u201cthe sensitivity and signifi\ncance of the interests presented in clashes between First\nAmendment and [state law] rights counsel relying on\nlimited principles that sweep no more broadly than the\nappropriate context of the instant case.\u201d Florida Star v.\nB. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 533 (1989).\n   Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many\nAmericans might feel the same about Westboro. West\nboro\u2019s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its con\ntribution to public discourse may be negligible. But\nWestboro addressed matters of public import on public\nproperty, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the\n                   Cite as: 562 U.

The speech was indeed planned\nto coincide with Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral, but did not\nitself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro\u2019s choice to con\nduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the\nnature of its speech.\n   Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move\nthem to tears of both joy and sorrow, and\u2014as it did here\u2014\ninflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react\nto that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we\nhave chosen a different course\u2014to protect even hurtful\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle\npublic debate. That choice requires that we shield West\nboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                                It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

That opin\nion restricts its analysis here to the matter raised in the\npetition for certiorari, namely, Westboro\u2019s picketing activ\nity. The opinion does not examine in depth the effect of\ntelevision broadcasting. Nor does it say anything about\nInternet postings.       The Court holds that the First\nAmendment protects the picketing that occurred here,\nprimarily because the picketing addressed matters of\n\u201cpublic concern.\u201d\n   While I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the pick\neting addressed matters of public concern, I do not believe\nthat our First Amendment analysis can stop at that point.\nA State can sometimes regulate picketing, even picketing\non matters of public concern. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487\nU. S. 474 (1988). Moreover, suppose that A were physi\ncally to assault B, knowing that the assault (being news\nworthy) would provide A with an opportunity to transmit\nto the public his views on a matter of public concern. The\nconstitutionally protected nature of the end would not\nshield A\u2019s use of unlawful, unprotected means. And in\nsome circumstances the use of certain words as means\nwould be similarly unprotected. See Chaplinsky v. New\nHampshire, 315 U.

Indeed, the\nstate tort of \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d\nforbids only conduct that produces distress \u201cso severe that\nno reasonable man could be expected to endure it,\u201d and\nwhich itself is \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme\nin degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,\nand to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in\na civilized community.\u201d Post, at 2\u20133 (opinion of ALITO, J.)\n(quoting Harris v.

Rather, the Court\nhas reviewed the underlying facts in detail, as will some\ntimes prove necessary where First Amendment values and\nstate-protected (say, privacy-related) interests seriously\nconflict. Cf. Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 533\n(1989); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,\nInc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984). That review makes clear\nthat Westboro\u2019s means of communicating its views con\nsisted of picketing in a place where picketing was lawful\nand in compliance with all police directions. The picketing\ncould not be seen or heard from the funeral ceremony\nitself. And Snyder testified that he saw no more than the\ntops of the picketers\u2019 signs as he drove to the funeral.

He is\nsimply a parent whose son, Marine Lance Corporal Mat\nthew Snyder, was killed in Iraq. Mr. Snyder wanted what\nis surely the right of any parent who experiences such an\nincalculable loss: to bury his son in peace. But respon\ndents, members of the Westboro Baptist Church, deprived\nhim of that elementary right. They first issued a press\nrelease and thus turned Matthew\u2019s funeral into a tumul\ntuous media event. They then appeared at the church,\napproached as closely as they could without trespassing,\nand launched a malevolent verbal attack on Matthew and\nhis family at a time of acute emotional vulnerability. As a\nresult, Albert Snyder suffered severe and lasting emo\ntional injury.1 The Court now holds that the First\nAmendment protected respondents\u2019 right to brutalize Mr.\nSnyder. I cannot agree.\n                         I\n  Respondents and other members of their church have\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 See   580 F. 3d 206, 213\u2013214, 216 (CA4 2009).\n2                    SNYDER v.

To\nprotect against such injury, \u201cmost if not all jurisdictions\u201d\npermit recovery in tort for the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (or IIED).

When grave injury is\nintentionally inflicted by means of an attack like the one\nat issue here, the First Amendment should not interfere\nwith recovery.\n                             III\n  In this case, respondents brutally attacked Matthew\nSnyder, and this attack, which was almost certain to\ninflict injury, was central to respondents\u2019 well-practiced\nstrategy for attracting public attention.\n  On the morning of Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral, respon\ndents could have chosen to stage their protest at countless\nlocations. They could have picketed the United States\nCapitol, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Penta\ngon, or any of the more than 5,600 military recruiting\nstations in this country. They could have returned to the\nMaryland State House or the United States Naval Acad\nemy, where they had been the day before. They could\nhave selected any public road where pedestrians are al\nlowed. (There are more than 4,000,000 miles of public\nroads in the United States.2) They could have staged their\nprotest in a public park. (There are more than 20,000\npublic parks in this country.3) They could have chosen any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See Dept. of Transp., Federal Highway Administration, Highway Sta\n\ntistics 2008, Table HM\u201312M, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/\nstatistics/2008/hm12m.cfm (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 25, 2011,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   3 See   Trust for Public Land, 2010 City Park Facts, http://\nwww.tpl.org/content_documents/CityParkFacts_2010.pdf.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

As the Court notes,\nchurch members have protested at nearly 600 military\nfunerals. Ante, at 1. They have also picketed the funerals\nof police officers,5 firefighters,6 and the victims of natural\ndisasters,7 accidents,8 and shocking crimes.9 And in ad\nvance of these protests, they issue press releases to ensure\nthat their protests will attract public attention.10\n  This strategy works because it is expected that respon\ndents\u2019 verbal assaults will wound the family and friends of\nthe deceased and because the media is irresistibly drawn\nto the sight of persons who are visibly in grief. The more\noutrageous the funeral protest, the more publicity the\nWestboro Baptist Church is able to obtain. Thus, when\nthe church recently announced its intention to picket the\nfuneral of a 9-year-old girl killed in the shooting spree in\nTucson\u2014proclaiming that she was \u201cbetter off dead\u201d11\u2014\ntheir announcement was national news,12 and the church\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 See United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Informa\n\ntion Project, http://www.usccb.org/comm/cip.shtml#toc4.\n   5 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110124_St-Petersburg-FL-\n\nDead-Police.pdf.\n   6 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110120_Dead-Volunteer-\n\nFirefighter-Connecting_the_Dots-Baltimore-MD.pdf.\n   7 See      http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110104_Newburg-and-\nRolla-MO-Tornado-Connecting-the-Dots.pdf.\n   8 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20101218_Wichita-KS-Two-\n\nDead-Wichita-Bikers.pdf.\n   9 See    http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110129_Tampa-FL-God-\nSent-Military-Mom-Shooter-to-Kill-Kids.pdf.\n   10 See nn. 5\u20139, supra.\n   11 See        http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110109_AZ-Shooter-\nConnecting-the-Dots-Day-2.pdf.\n   12 See, e.g., Stanglin, Anti-Gay Church Group Plans to Picket Tucson\n6                         SNYDER v.

This\nannouncement guaranteed that Matthew\u2019s funeral would\nbe transformed into a raucous media event and began the\nwounding process. It is well known that anticipation may\nheighten the effect of a painful event.\n   On the day of the funeral, respondents, true to their\nword, displayed placards that conveyed the message prom\nised in their press release.

Since respon\ndents chose to stage their protest at Matthew Snyder\u2019s\nfuneral and not at any of the other countless available\nvenues, a reasonable person would have assumed that\nthere was a connection between the messages on the\nplacards and the deceased. Moreover, since a church\nfuneral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts\nabout the afterlife, some of respondents\u2019 signs\u2014e.g., \u201cGod\nHates You,\u201d \u201cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Going\nto Hell\u201d\u2014would have likely been interpreted as referring\nto God\u2019s judgment of the deceased.\n  Other signs would most naturally have been understood\nas suggesting\u2014falsely\u2014that Matthew was gay. Homo\nsexuality was the theme of many of the signs. There were\nsigns reading \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d \u201cSemper Fi Fags,\u201d \u201cFags\nDoom Nations,\u201d and \u201cFag Troops.\u201d Id., at 3781\u20133787.\nAnother placard depicted two men engaging in anal inter\ncourse.

Both Matthew and petitioner\nwere private figures,16 and this attack was not speech on a\nmatter of public concern. While commentary on the Cath\nolic Church or the United States military constitutes\nspeech on matters of public concern, speech regarding\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s purely private conduct does not.\n   JUSTICE BREYER provides an apt analogy to a case in\nwhich the First Amendment would permit recovery in tort\nfor a verbal attack:\n    \u201c[S]uppose that A were physically to assault B, know\n    ing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide\n    A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his\n    views on a matter of public concern.

In\ndeed, this is the strategy that they have routinely em\nployed\u2014and that they will now continue to employ\u2014\ninflicting severe and lasting emotional injury on an ever\ngrowing list of innocent victims.\n                         IV\n  The Court concludes that respondents\u2019 speech was\nprotected by the First Amendment for essentially three\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 16 See   533 F. Supp. 2d 567, 577 (Md. 2008).\n10                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nreasons, but none is sound.\n   First\u2014and most important\u2014the Court finds that \u201cthe\noverall thrust and dominant theme of [their] demonstra\ntion spoke to\u201d broad public issues. Ante, at 8. As I have\nattempted to show, this portrayal is quite inaccurate;\nrespondents\u2019 attack on Matthew was of central impor\ntance. But in any event, I fail to see why actionable\nspeech should be immunized simply because it is inter\nspersed with speech that is protected. The First Amend\nment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are\ninterspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters\nof public concern, and there is no good reason why respon\ndents\u2019 attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be\ntreated differently.\n   Second, the Court suggests that respondents\u2019 personal\nattack on Matthew Snyder is entitled to First Amendment\nprotection because it was not motivated by a private\ngrudge, see ante, at 9, but I see no basis for the strange\ndistinction that the Court appears to draw. Respondents\u2019\nmotivation\u2014\u201cto increase publicity for its views,\u201d ibid.\u2014did\nnot transform their statements attacking the character\nof a private figure into statements that made a contri\nbution to debate on matters of public concern. Nor did\ntheir publicity-seeking motivation soften the sting of their\nattack. And as far as culpability is concerned, one might\nwell think that wounding statements uttered in the heat\nof a private feud are less, not more, blameworthy than\nsimilar statements made as part of a cold and calculated\nstrategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting pub\nlic attention.\n   Third, the Court finds it significant that respondents\u2019\nprotest occurred on a public street, but this fact alone\nshould not be enough to preclude IIED liability. To be\nsure, statements made on a public street may be less\nlikely to satisfy the elements of the IIED tort than state\nments made on private property, but there is no reason\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwhy a public street in close proximity to the scene of a\nfuneral should be regarded as a free-fire zone in which\notherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded from\nliability. If the First Amendment permits the States to\nprotect their residents from the harm inflicted by such\nattacks\u2014and the Court does not hold otherwise\u2014then the\nlocation of the tort should not be dispositive. A physical\nassault may occur without trespassing; it is no defense\nthat the perpetrator had \u201cthe right to be where [he was].\u201d\nSee ante, at 11. And the same should be true with respect\nto unprotected speech. Neither classic \u201cfighting words\u201d\nnor defamatory statements are immunized when they\noccur in a public place, and there is no good reason to treat\na verbal assault based on the conduct or character of a\nprivate figure like Matthew Snyder any differently.\n   One final comment about the opinion of the Court is in\norder. The Court suggests that the wounds inflicted by\nvicious verbal assaults at funerals will be prevented or at\nleast mitigated in the future by new laws that restrict\npicketing within a specified distance of a funeral. See\nante, at 10\u201311. It is apparent, however, that the enact\nment of these laws is no substitute for the protection\nprovided by the established IIED tort; according to the\nCourt, the verbal attacks that severely wounded petitioner\nin this case complied with the new Maryland law regulat\ning funeral picketing. See ante, at 11, n. 5. And there is\nabsolutely nothing to suggest that Congress and the state\nlegislatures, in enacting these laws, intended them to\ndisplace the protection provided by the well-established\nIIED tort.\n   The real significance of these new laws is not that they\nobviate the need for IIED protection. Rather, their enact\nment dramatically illustrates the fundamental point that\nfunerals are unique events at which special protection\nagainst emotional assaults is in order. At funerals, the\nemotional well-being of bereaved relatives is particularly\n12                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nvulnerable. See National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 168 (2004). Exploitation of a fu\nneral for the purpose of attracting public attention \u201cin\ntrud[es] upon their . . . grief,\u201d ibid., and may permanently\nstain their memories of the final moments before a loved\none is laid to rest. Allowing family members to have a few\nhours of peace without harassment does not undermine\npublic debate. I would therefore hold that, in this setting,\nthe First Amendment permits a private figure to recover\nfor the intentional infliction of emotional distress caused\nby speech on a matter of private concern.\n                              V\n  In reversing the District Court judgment in favor of\npetitioner, the Court of Appeals relied on several grounds\nnot discussed in the opinion of this Court or in the sepa\nrate opinion supporting affirmance. I now turn briefly to\nthose issues.\n  First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\nerred by allowing the jury to decide whether respondents\u2019\nspeech was \u201c \u2018directed specifically at the Snyder family.\u2019 \u201d\n580 F. 3d, at 221. It is not clear whether the Court of\nAppeals thought that this was a question for the trial\njudge alone or a question on which the judge had to make\na preliminary ruling before sending it to the jury. In\neither event, however, the submission of this question to\nthe jury was not reversible error because, as explained\nabove, it is clear that respondents\u2019 statements targeted the\nSnyders.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge\nwent astray in allowing the jury to decide whether re\nspondents\u2019 speech was so \u201c \u2018offensive and shocking as to\nnot be entitled to First Amendment protection.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\nThis instruction also did respondents no harm. Because\ntheir speech did not relate to a matter of public concern, it\nwas not protected from liability by the First Amendment,\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   13\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand the only question for the jury was whether the ele\nments of the IIED tort were met.\n   Third, the Court of Appeals appears to have concluded\nthat the First Amendment does not permit an IIED plain\ntiff to recover for speech that cannot reasonably be inter\npreted as stating actual facts about an individual. See id.,\nat 222. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals\nrelied on two of our cases\u2014Milkovich v. Lorain Journal\nCo., 497 U. S. 1 (1990), and Hustler, 485 U. S. 46\u2014but\nneither supports the broad proposition that the Court of\nAppeals adopted.\n   Milkovich was a defamation case, and falsity is an ele\nment of defamation. Nothing in Milkovich even hints that\nthe First Amendment requires that this defamation ele\nment be engrafted onto the IIED tort.\n   Hustler did involve an IIED claim, but the plaintiff\nthere was a public figure, and the Court did not suggest\nthat its holding would also apply in a case involving a\nprivate figure. Nor did the Court suggest that its holding\napplied across the board to all types of IIED claims. In\nstead, the holding was limited to \u201cpublications such as the\none here at issue,\u201d namely, a caricature in a magazine.\n485 U. S., at 56. Unless a caricature of a public figure can\nreasonably be interpreted as stating facts that may be\nproved to be wrong, the caricature does not have the same\npotential to wound as a personal verbal assault on a vul\nnerable private figure.\n   Because I cannot agree either with the holding of this\nCourt or the other grounds on which the Court of Appeals\nrelied, I would reverse the decision below and remand for\nfurther proceedings.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 The Court affirms the decision of the Fourth Circuit with respect to\n\npetitioner\u2019s claim of intrusion upon seclusion on a ground not addressed\nby the Fourth Circuit. I would not reach out to decide that issue but\nwould instead leave it for the Fourth Circuit to decide on remand. I\nwould likewise allow the Fourth Circuit on remand to decide whether\n14                       SNYDER v.

I\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nthe judgment on the claim of civil conspiracy can survive in light of the\n\nultimate disposition of the IIED and intrusion upon seclusion claims. \n\n",

PHELPS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u2013751.     Argued October 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 2, 2011\nFor the past 20 years, the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church\n  has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that God\n  hates the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particu\n  larly in America\u2019s military. The church\u2019s picketing has also con\n  demned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy. Fred\n  Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishion\n  ers (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral\n  of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in\n  the line of duty. The picketing took place on public land approxi\n  mately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in ac\n  cordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers. The\n  picketers peacefully displayed their signs\u2014stating, e.g., \u201cThank God\n  for Dead Soldiers,\u201d \u201cFags Doom Nations,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d\n  \u201cPriests Rape Boys,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell\u201d\u2014for about 30 min\n  utes before the funeral began. Matthew Snyder\u2019s father (Snyder), pe\n  titioner here, saw the tops of the picketers\u2019 signs when driving to the\n  funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watch\n  ing a news broadcast later that night.\n     Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughters\u2014who\n  participated in the picketing\u2014and the church (collectively Westboro)\n  alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of\n  emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy. A\n  jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and\n  punitive damages. Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly exces\n  sive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the\n  First Amendment fully protected its speech. The District Court re\n  duced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise in\n  tact. The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboro\u2019s state\n2                         SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ments were entitled to First Amendment protection because those\n    statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably\n    false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.\nHeld: The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its\n picketing in this case. Pp. 5\u201315.\n    (a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment can serve as a\n defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of\n emotional distress. Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46,\n 50-51. Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro li\n able for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is\n of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances\n of the case. \u201c[S]peech on public issues occupies the \u2018 \u201chighest rung of\n the hierarchy of First Amendment values\u201d \u2019 and is entitled to special\n protection.\u201d Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145. Although the\n boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern\n are not well defined, this Court has said that speech is of public con\n cern when it can \u201cbe fairly considered as relating to any matter of po\n litical, social, or other concern to the community,\u201d id., at 146, or when\n it \u201cis a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the\n public,\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83\u201384. A statement\u2019s argua\n bly \u201cinappropriate or controversial character . . . is irrelevant to the\n question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.\u201d Rankin v.\n McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387. Pp. 5\u20137.\n    To determine whether speech is of public or private concern, this\n Court must independently examine the \u201c \u2018content, form, and con\n text,\u2019 \u201d of the speech \u201c \u2018as revealed by the whole record.\u2019 \u201d Dun &\n Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 761. In\n considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it\n is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    The \u201ccontent\u201d of Westboro\u2019s signs plainly relates to public, rather\n than private, matters. The placards highlighted issues of public im\n port\u2014the political and moral conduct of the United States and its\n citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and\n scandals involving the Catholic clergy\u2014and Westboro conveyed its\n views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public\n audience as possible. Even if a few of the signs were viewed as con\n taining messages related to a particular individual, that would not\n change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboro\u2019s demonstra\n tion spoke to broader public issues. P. 8.\n    The \u201ccontext\u201d of the speech\u2014its connection with Matthew Snyder\u2019s\n funeral\u2014cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro\u2019s speech.\n The signs reflected Westboro\u2019s condemnation of much in modern soci\n ety, and it cannot be argued that Westboro\u2019s use of speech on public\n issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nSnyder from liability. Westboro had been actively engaged in speak\ning on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became\naware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the\npicketing did not represent Westboro\u2019s honestly held beliefs on public\nissues. Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase\npublicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly\nhurtful to Snyder. That does not mean that its speech should be af\nforded less than full First Amendment protection under the circum\nstances of this case. Pp. 8\u201310.\n   That said, \u201c \u2018[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all\nplaces and at all times.\u2019 \u201d Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 479.\nWestboro\u2019s choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not\nbeyond the Government\u2019s regulatory reach\u2014it is \u201csubject to reason\nable time, place, or manner restrictions.\u201d Clark v. Community for\nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293. The facts here are quite\ndifferent, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated\nand the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited\nsituations where the Court has concluded that the location of tar\ngeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed\ncontent neutral. Frisby, supra, at 477; Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health\nCenter, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 768, distinguished. Maryland now has a\nlaw restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the\ntime of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider\nwhether that law is a \u201creasonable time, place, or manner restric\ntio[n]\u201d under the standards announced by this Court. Clark, supra,\nat 293. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   The \u201cspecial protection\u201d afforded to what Westboro said, in the\nwhole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome\nby a jury finding that the picketing was \u201coutrageous\u201d for purposes of\napplying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional dis\ntress. That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish\nWestboro for its views on matters of public concern. For all these\nreasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for inten\ntional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   (b) Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclu\nsion. He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his\nson\u2019s funeral, but the captive audience doctrine\u2014which has been ap\nplied sparingly, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736\u2013\n738; Frisby, supra, at 484\u2013485\u2014should not be expanded to the cir\ncumstances here. Westboro stayed well away from the memorial ser\nvice, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers\u2019 signs,\nand there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the fu\nneral service itself. Pp. 13\u201314.\n   (c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for in\n4                          SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclu\n    sion\u2014the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accom\n    plish\u2014Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those\n    torts. P. 14.\n      (d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public prop\n    erty, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of lo\n    cal officials. It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder\u2019s funeral, and its\n    choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its\n    speech. Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful\n    speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled,\n    Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this\n    case.

The picket signs reflected the\nchurch\u2019s view that the United States is overly tolerant of\nsin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment.\nThe question presented is whether the First Amendment\nshields the church members from tort liability for their\nspeech in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in\nTopeka, Kansas, in 1955. The church\u2019s congregation\nbelieves that God hates and punishes the United States\nfor its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in Amer\nica\u2019s military. The church frequently communicates its\nviews by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more\nthan 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have\npublicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600\nfunerals.

PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in\nIraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder\u2019s father\nselected the Catholic church in the Snyders\u2019 hometown of\nWestminster, Maryland, as the site for his son\u2019s funeral.\nLocal newspapers provided notice of the time and location\nof the service.\n   Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral and\ndecided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro\nBaptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of\nhis grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial\nservice, the Westboro congregation members picketed on\npublic land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland\nState House, the United States Naval Academy, and\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s funeral. The Westboro picketers car\nried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.\nThey stated, for instance: \u201cGod Hates the USA/Thank God\nfor 9/11,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Pray for the USA,\u201d\n\u201cThank God for IEDs,\u201d \u201cThank God for Dead Soldiers,\u201d\n\u201cPope in Hell,\u201d \u201cPriests Rape Boys,\u201d \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell,\u201d and \u201cGod Hates You.\u201d\n   The church had notified the authorities in advance of its\nintent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picket\ners complied with police instructions in staging their\ndemonstration. The picketing took place within a 10- by\n25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street,\nbehind a temporary fence.

The West\nboro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes\nbefore the funeral began and sang hymns and recited\nBible verses. None of the picketers entered church prop\nerty or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or use\nprofanity, and there was no violence associated with the\npicketing.

Although Snyder testified that he could\nsee the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral,\nhe did not see what was written on the signs until later\nthat night, while watching a news broadcast covering the\nevent. Id., at 2084\u20132086.1\n                              B\n   Snyder filed suit against Phelps, Phelps\u2019s daughters,\nand the Westboro Baptist Church (collectively Westboro or\nthe church) in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Maryland under that court\u2019s diversity jurisdic\ntion. Snyder alleged five state tort law claims: defama\ntion, publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil\nconspiracy.     Westboro moved for summary judgment\ncontending, in part, that the church\u2019s speech was insu\nlated from liability by the First Amendment.

Snyder discovered the posting, referred to by\nthe parties as the \u201cepic,\u201d during an Internet search for his son\u2019s name.\nThe epic is not properly before us and does not factor in our analysis.\nAlthough the epic was submitted to the jury and discussed in the courts\nbelow, Snyder never mentioned it in his petition for certiorari. See Pet.\nfor Cert. i (\u201cSnyder\u2019s claim arose out of Phelps\u2019 intentional acts at\nSnyder\u2019s son\u2019s funeral\u201d (emphasis added)); this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(g)\n(petition must contain statement \u201csetting out the facts material to\nconsideration of the question presented\u201d). Nor did Snyder respond to\nthe statement in the opposition to certiorari that \u201c[t]hough the epic was\nasserted as a basis for the claims at trial, the petition . . . appears to be\naddressing only claims based on the picketing.\u201d Brief in Opposition 9.\nSnyder devoted only one paragraph in the argument section of his\nopening merits brief to the epic. Given the foregoing and the fact that\nan Internet posting may raise distinct issues in this context, we decline\nto consider the epic in deciding this case. See Ontario v. Quon, 560\nU.

PHELPS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court awarded Westboro summary judg\nment on Snyder\u2019s claims for defamation and publicity\ngiven to private life, concluding that Snyder could not\nprove the necessary elements of those torts. Id., at 572\u2013\n573. A trial was held on the remaining claims. At trial,\nSnyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.\nHe testified that he is unable to separate the thought of\nhis dead son from his thoughts of Westboro\u2019s picketing,\nand that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill\nwhen he thinks about it. Id., at 588\u2013589. Expert wit\nnesses testified that Snyder\u2019s emotional anguish had\nresulted in severe depression and had exacerbated pre\nexisting health conditions.\n   A jury found for Snyder on the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil\nconspiracy claims, and held Westboro liable for $2.9 mil\nlion in compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive\ndamages. Westboro filed several post-trial motions, in\ncluding a motion contending that the jury verdict was\ngrossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a\nmatter of law on all claims on First Amendment grounds.\nThe District Court remitted the punitive damages award\nto $2.1 million, but left the jury verdict otherwise intact.\nId., at 597.\n   In the Court of Appeals, Westboro\u2019s primary argument\nwas that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law because the First Amendment fully protected West\nboro\u2019s speech. The Court of Appeals agreed. 580 F. 3d\n206, 221 (CA4 2009). The court reviewed the picket signs\nand concluded that Westboro\u2019s statements were entitled to\nFirst Amendment protection because those statements\nwere on matters of public concern, were not provably false,\nand were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.\nId., at 222\u2013224.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 One judge concurred in the judgment on the ground that Snyder had\n\nfailed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to support a jury verdict\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

The\nCourt of Appeals majority determined that the picketers had \u201cvoluntar\nily waived\u201d any such contention on appeal. Id., at 216. Like the court\nbelow, we proceed on the unexamined premise that respondents\u2019 speech\nwas tortious.\n   3 The dissent attempts to draw parallels between this case and hy\n\npothetical cases involving defamation or fighting words. Post, at 10\u201311\n(opinion of ALITO, J.). But, as the court below noted, there is \u201cno\nsuggestion that the speech at issue falls within one of the categorical\nexclusions from First Amendment protection, such as those for obscen\nity or \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d 580 F. 3d, at 218, n. 12; see United States v.\nStevens, 559 U.

S. 64, 74\u201375 (1964). Accordingly, \u201cspeech on public\nissues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First\nAmendment values, and is entitled to special protection.\u201d\nConnick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145 (1983) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  \u201c \u2018[N]ot all speech is of equal First Amendment impor\ntance,\u2019 \u201d however, and where matters of purely private\nsignificance are at issue, First Amendment protections are\noften less rigorous. Hustler, supra, at 56 (quoting Dun &\nBradstreet, supra, at 758); see Connick, supra, at 145\u2013147.\nThat is because restricting speech on purely private mat\nters does not implicate the same constitutional concerns\nas limiting speech on matters of public interest: \u201c[T]here is\nno threat to the free and robust debate of public issues;\nthere is no potential interference with a meaningful dia\nlogue of ideas\u201d; and the \u201cthreat of liability\u201d does not pose\nthe risk of \u201ca reaction of self-censorship\u201d on matters of\npublic import. Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 760 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  We noted a short time ago, in considering whether\npublic employee speech addressed a matter of public con\ncern, that \u201cthe boundaries of the public concern test are\nnot well defined.\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 83\n(2004) (per curiam). Although that remains true today, we\nhave articulated some guiding principles, principles that\naccord broad protection to speech to ensure that courts\nthemselves do not become inadvertent censors.\n  Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can\n\u201cbe fairly considered as relating to any matter of politi-\ncal, social, or other concern to the community,\u201d Connick,\nsupra, at 146, or when it \u201cis a subject of legitimate news\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The arguably \u201cinappropriate or controversial\ncharacter of a statement is irrelevant to the question\nwhether it deals with a matter of public concern.\u201d Rankin\nv. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 387 (1987).\n   Our opinion in Dun & Bradstreet, on the other hand,\nprovides an example of speech of only private concern. In\nthat case we held, as a general matter, that information\nabout a particular individual\u2019s credit report \u201cconcerns no\npublic issue.\u201d 472 U. S., at 762. The content of the report,\nwe explained, \u201cwas speech solely in the individual interest\nof the speaker and its specific business audience.\u201d Ibid.\nThat was confirmed by the fact that the particular report\nwas sent to only five subscribers to the reporting service,\nwho were bound not to disseminate it further. Ibid. To\ncite another example, we concluded in San Diego v. Roe\nthat, in the context of a government employer regulating\nthe speech of its employees, videos of an employee engag\ning in sexually explicit acts did not address a public con\ncern; the videos \u201cdid nothing to inform the public about\nany aspect of the [employing agency\u2019s] functioning or\noperation.\u201d 543 U. S., at 84.\n   Deciding whether speech is of public or private concern\nrequires us to examine the \u201c \u2018content, form, and context\u2019 \u201d\nof that speech, \u201c \u2018as revealed by the whole record.\u2019 \u201d Dun &\nBradstreet, supra, at 761 (quoting Connick, supra, at 147\u2013\n148). As in other First Amendment cases, the court is\nobligated \u201cto \u2018make an independent examination of the\nwhole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment\ndoes not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of\nfree expression.\u2019 \u201d Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\nUnited States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984) (quoting New\nYork Times, supra, at 284\u2013286). In considering content,\n8                    SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nform, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is neces\nsary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, in\ncluding what was said, where it was said, and how it was\nsaid.\n   The \u201ccontent\u201d of Westboro\u2019s signs plainly relates to\nbroad issues of interest to society at large, rather than\nmatters of \u201cpurely private concern.\u201d Dun & Bradstreet,\nsupra, at 759.       The placards read \u201cGod Hates the\nUSA/Thank God for 9/11,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t\nPray for the USA,\u201d \u201cThank God for IEDs,\u201d \u201cFag Troops,\u201d\n\u201cSemper Fi Fags,\u201d \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d \u201cMaryland Taliban,\u201d\n\u201cFags Doom Nations,\u201d \u201cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\u201d \u201cThank\nGod for Dead Soldiers,\u201d \u201cPope in Hell,\u201d \u201cPriests Rape\nBoys,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell,\u201d and \u201cGod Hates You.\u201d App.\n3781\u20133787. While these messages may fall short of\nrefined social or political commentary, the issues they\nhighlight\u2014the political and moral conduct of the United\nStates and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexual\nity in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic\nclergy\u2014are matters of public import. The signs certainly\nconvey Westboro\u2019s position on those issues, in a manner\ndesigned, unlike the private speech in Dun & Bradstreet,\nto reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even\nif a few of the signs\u2014such as \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell\u201d and\n\u201cGod Hates You\u201d\u2014were viewed as containing messages\nrelated to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically,\nthat would not change the fact that the overall thrust and\ndominant theme of Westboro\u2019s demonstration spoke to\nbroader public issues.\n   Apart from the content of Westboro\u2019s signs, Snyder\ncontends that the \u201ccontext\u201d of the speech\u2014its connection\nwith his son\u2019s funeral\u2014makes the speech a matter of\nprivate rather than public concern. The fact that West\nboro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot\nby itself transform the nature of Westboro\u2019s speech.\nWestboro\u2019s signs, displayed on public land next to a public\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstreet, reflect the fact that the church finds much to con\ndemn in modern society. Its speech is \u201cfairly characterized\nas constituting speech on a matter of public concern,\u201d\nConnick, 461 U. S., at 146, and the funeral setting does\nnot alter that conclusion.\n   Snyder argues that the church members in fact mounted\na personal attack on Snyder and his family, and then\nattempted to \u201cimmunize their conduct by claiming that\nthey were actually protesting the United States\u2019 tolerance\nof homosexuality or the supposed evils of the Catholic\nChurch.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 10. We are not con\ncerned in this case that Westboro\u2019s speech on public mat\nters was in any way contrived to insulate speech on a\nprivate matter from liability. Westboro had been actively\nengaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its pick\neting long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and\nthere can be no serious claim that Westboro\u2019s picketing\ndid not represent its \u201chonestly believed\u201d views on public\nissues. Garrison, 379 U. S., at 73. There was no pre\nexisting relationship or conflict between Westboro and\nSnyder that might suggest Westboro\u2019s speech on public\nmatters was intended to mask an attack on Snyder over a\nprivate matter. Contrast Connick, supra, at 153 (finding\npublic employee speech a matter of private concern when\nit was \u201cno coincidence that [the speech] followed upon the\nheels of [a] transfer notice\u201d affecting the employee).\n   Snyder goes on to argue that Westboro\u2019s speech should\nbe afforded less than full First Amendment protection \u201cnot\nonly because of the words\u201d but also because the church\nmembers exploited the funeral \u201cas a platform to bring\ntheir message to a broader audience.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n44, 40. There is no doubt that Westboro chose to stage its\npicketing at the Naval Academy, the Maryland State\nHouse, and Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral to increase publicity\nfor its views and because of the relation between those\nsites and its views\u2014in the case of the military funeral,\n10                       SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause Westboro believes that God is killing American\nsoldiers as punishment for the Nation\u2019s sinful policies.\n  Westboro\u2019s choice to convey its views in conjunction with\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s funeral made the expression of those\nviews particularly hurtful to many, especially to Mat\nthew\u2019s father. The record makes clear that the applicable\nlegal term\u2014\u201cemotional distress\u201d\u2014fails to capture fully the\nanguish Westboro\u2019s choice added to Mr. Snyder\u2019s already\nincalculable grief. But Westboro conducted its picketing\npeacefully on matters of public concern at a public place\nadjacent to a public street. Such space occupies a \u201cspecial\nposition in terms of First Amendment protection.\u201d United\nStates v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983). \u201c[W]e have\nrepeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a\ntraditional public forum,\u201d noting that \u201c \u2018[t]ime out of mind\u2019\npublic streets and sidewalks have been used for public\nassembly and debate.\u201d Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474,\n480 (1988).4\n  That said, \u201c[e]ven protected speech is not equally per\nmissible in all places and at all times.\u201d Id., at 479 (quot\ning Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 788, 799 (1985)). Westboro\u2019s choice of where and\nwhen to conduct its picketing is not beyond the Govern\nment\u2019s regulatory reach\u2014it is \u201csubject to reasonable time,\nplace, or manner restrictions\u201d that are consistent with the\nstandards announced in this Court\u2019s precedents. Clark v.\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293\n(1984). Maryland now has a law imposing restrictions on\nfuneral picketing, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a710\u2013205\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent is wrong to suggest that the Court considers a public\nstreet \u201ca free-fire zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are\nshielded from liability.\u201d Post, at 10\u201311. The fact that Westboro con\nducted its picketing adjacent to a public street does not insulate the\nspeech from liability, but instead heightens concerns that what is at\nissue is an effort to communicate to the public the church\u2019s views on\nmatters of public concern. That is why our precedents so clearly\nrecognize the special significance of this traditional public forum.\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(Lexis Supp. 2010), as do 43 other States and the Federal\nGovernment. See Brief for American Legion as Amicus\nCuriae 18\u201319, n. 2 (listing statutes). To the extent these\nlaws are content neutral, they raise very different ques\ntions from the tort verdict at issue in this case. Mary\nland\u2019s law, however, was not in effect at the time of the\nevents at issue here, so we have no occasion to consider\nhow it might apply to facts such as those before us, or\nwhether it or other similar regulations are constitutional.5\n   We have identified a few limited situations where the\nlocation of targeted picketing can be regulated under\nprovisions that the Court has determined to be content\nneutral. In Frisby, for example, we upheld a ban on such\npicketing \u201cbefore or about\u201d a particular residence, 487\nU. S., at 477. In Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc.,\nwe approved an injunction requiring a buffer zone between\nprotesters and an abortion clinic entrance. 512 U. S. 753,\n768 (1994). The facts here are obviously quite different,\nboth with respect to the activity being regulated and the\nmeans of restricting those activities.\n   Simply put, the church members had the right to be\nwhere they were. Westboro alerted local authorities to its\nfuneral protest and fully complied with police guidance on\nwhere the picketing could be staged. The picketing was\nconducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from\nthe church, out of the sight of those at the church. The\nprotest was not unruly; there was no shouting, profanity,\nor violence.\n   The record confirms that any distress occasioned by\nWestboro\u2019s picketing turned on the content and viewpoint\nof the message conveyed, rather than any interference\nwith the funeral itself. A group of parishioners standing\nat the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Maryland law prohibits picketing within 100 feet of a funeral\n\nservice or funeral procession; Westboro\u2019s picketing would have complied\nwith that restriction.\n12                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsaid \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and \u201cGod Loves You,\u201d would not\nhave been subjected to liability. It was what Westboro\nsaid that exposed it to tort damages.\n   Given that Westboro\u2019s speech was at a public place on a\nmatter of public concern, that speech is entitled to \u201cspecial\nprotection\u201d under the First Amendment. Such speech\ncannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or\narouses contempt. \u201cIf there is a bedrock principle underly\ning the First Amendment, it is that the government may\nnot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because\nsociety finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989). Indeed, \u201cthe\npoint of all speech protection . . . is to shield just those\nchoices of content that in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or\neven hurtful.\u201d Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and\nBisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 574 (1995).\n   The jury here was instructed that it could hold Westboro\nliable for intentional infliction of emotional distress based\non a finding that Westboro\u2019s picketing was \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cOutrageousness,\u201d however, is a highly malleable standard\nwith \u201can inherent subjectiveness about it which would\nallow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors\u2019\ntastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a\nparticular expression.\u201d Hustler, 485 U.

The\nCourt of Appeals did not examine these torts independ\nently of the intentional infliction of emotional distress tort.\nInstead, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\nwholesale, holding that the judgment wrongly \u201cattache[d]\ntort liability to constitutionally protected speech.\u201d 580\nF. 3d, at 226.\n  Snyder argues that even assuming Westboro\u2019s speech\nis entitled to First Amendment protection generally, the\nchurch is not immunized from liability for intrusion upon\nseclusion because Snyder was a member of a captive audi\nence at his son\u2019s funeral. Brief for Petitioner 45\u201346. We\ndo not agree. In most circumstances, \u201cthe Constitution\ndoes not permit the government to decide which types of\notherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to\nrequire protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.\nRather, . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to\navoid further bombardment of [his] sensibilities simply by\naverting [his] eyes.\u201d Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S.\n205, 210\u2013211 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAs a result, \u201c[t]he ability of government, consonant with\nthe Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect\nothers from hearing it is . . . dependent upon a showing\nthat substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an\nessentially intolerable manner.\u201d Cohen v. California, 403\nU. S. 15, 21 (1971).\n  As a general matter, we have applied the captive audi\n14                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nence doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners\nfrom protected speech. For example, we have upheld a\nstatute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of\noffensive mail to his home, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept.,\n397 U. S. 728, 736\u2013738 (1970), and an ordinance prohibit\ning picketing \u201cbefore or about\u201d any individual\u2019s residence,\nFrisby, 487 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\n   Here, Westboro stayed well away from the memorial\nservice. Snyder could see no more than the tops of the\nsigns when driving to the funeral. And there is no indica\ntion that the picketing in any way interfered with the\nfuneral service itself. We decline to expand the captive\naudience doctrine to the circumstances presented here.\n   Because we find that the First Amendment bars Snyder\nfrom recovery for intentional infliction of emotional dis\ntress or intrusion upon seclusion\u2014the alleged unlawful\nactivity Westboro conspired to accomplish\u2014we must\nlikewise hold that Snyder cannot recover for civil conspir\nacy based on those torts.\n                              IV\n   Our holding today is narrow. We are required in First\nAmendment cases to carefully review the record, and the\nreach of our opinion here is limited by the particular facts\nbefore us. As we have noted, \u201cthe sensitivity and signifi\ncance of the interests presented in clashes between First\nAmendment and [state law] rights counsel relying on\nlimited principles that sweep no more broadly than the\nappropriate context of the instant case.\u201d Florida Star v.\nB.

West\nboro\u2019s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its con\ntribution to public discourse may be negligible.

The speech was indeed planned\nto coincide with Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral, but did not\nitself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro\u2019s choice to con\nduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the\nnature of its speech.\n   Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move\nthem to tears of both joy and sorrow, and\u2014as it did here\u2014\ninflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react\nto that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we\nhave chosen a different course\u2014to protect even hurtful\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle\npublic debate. That choice requires that we shield West\nboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit is affirmed.\n                                                It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

That opin\nion restricts its analysis here to the matter raised in the\npetition for certiorari, namely, Westboro\u2019s picketing activ\nity. The opinion does not examine in depth the effect of\ntelevision broadcasting. Nor does it say anything about\nInternet postings.       The Court holds that the First\nAmendment protects the picketing that occurred here,\nprimarily because the picketing addressed matters of\n\u201cpublic concern.\u201d\n   While I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the pick\neting addressed matters of public concern, I do not believe\nthat our First Amendment analysis can stop at that point.\nA State can sometimes regulate picketing, even picketing\non matters of public concern. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487\nU. S. 474 (1988). Moreover, suppose that A were physi\ncally to assault B, knowing that the assault (being news\nworthy) would provide A with an opportunity to transmit\nto the public his views on a matter of public concern. The\nconstitutionally protected nature of the end would not\nshield A\u2019s use of unlawful, unprotected means. And in\nsome circumstances the use of certain words as means\nwould be similarly unprotected. See Chaplinsky v. New\nHampshire, 315 U.

Rather, the Court\nhas reviewed the underlying facts in detail, as will some\ntimes prove necessary where First Amendment values and\nstate-protected (say, privacy-related) interests seriously\nconflict.

That review makes clear\nthat Westboro\u2019s means of communicating its views con\nsisted of picketing in a place where picketing was lawful\nand in compliance with all police directions.

He is\nsimply a parent whose son, Marine Lance Corporal Mat\nthew Snyder, was killed in Iraq. Mr. Snyder wanted what\nis surely the right of any parent who experiences such an\nincalculable loss: to bury his son in peace. But respon\ndents, members of the Westboro Baptist Church, deprived\nhim of that elementary right. They first issued a press\nrelease and thus turned Matthew\u2019s funeral into a tumul\ntuous media event. They then appeared at the church,\napproached as closely as they could without trespassing,\nand launched a malevolent verbal attack on Matthew and\nhis family at a time of acute emotional vulnerability. As a\nresult, Albert Snyder suffered severe and lasting emo\ntional injury.1 The Court now holds that the First\nAmendment protected respondents\u2019 right to brutalize Mr.\nSnyder. I cannot agree.\n                         I\n  Respondents and other members of their church have\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 See   580 F. 3d 206, 213\u2013214, 216 (CA4 2009).\n2                    SNYDER v.

To\nprotect against such injury, \u201cmost if not all jurisdictions\u201d\npermit recovery in tort for the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (or IIED).

They could have returned to the\nMaryland State House or the United States Naval Acad\nemy, where they had been the day before. They could\nhave selected any public road where pedestrians are al\nlowed.

As the Court notes,\nchurch members have protested at nearly 600 military\nfunerals. Ante, at 1. They have also picketed the funerals\nof police officers,5 firefighters,6 and the victims of natural\ndisasters,7 accidents,8 and shocking crimes.9 And in ad\nvance of these protests, they issue press releases to ensure\nthat their protests will attract public attention.10\n  This strategy works because it is expected that respon\ndents\u2019 verbal assaults will wound the family and friends of\nthe deceased and because the media is irresistibly drawn\nto the sight of persons who are visibly in grief. The more\noutrageous the funeral protest, the more publicity the\nWestboro Baptist Church is able to obtain. Thus, when\nthe church recently announced its intention to picket the\nfuneral of a 9-year-old girl killed in the shooting spree in\nTucson\u2014proclaiming that she was \u201cbetter off dead\u201d11\u2014\ntheir announcement was national news,12 and the church\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 See United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Informa\n\ntion Project, http://www.usccb.org/comm/cip.shtml#toc4.\n   5 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110124_St-Petersburg-FL-\n\nDead-Police.pdf.\n   6 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110120_Dead-Volunteer-\n\nFirefighter-Connecting_the_Dots-Baltimore-MD.pdf.\n   7 See      http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110104_Newburg-and-\nRolla-MO-Tornado-Connecting-the-Dots.pdf.\n   8 See http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20101218_Wichita-KS-Two-\n\nDead-Wichita-Bikers.pdf.\n   9 See    http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110129_Tampa-FL-God-\nSent-Military-Mom-Shooter-to-Kill-Kids.pdf.\n   10 See nn. 5\u20139, supra.\n   11 See        http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20110109_AZ-Shooter-\nConnecting-the-Dots-Day-2.pdf.\n   12 See, e.g., Stanglin, Anti-Gay Church Group Plans to Picket Tucson\n6                         SNYDER v.

App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 08\u20131026\n(CA4), pp. 3787, 3788 (hereinafter App.). Others, stating\n\u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell\u201d and \u201cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\u201d\nconveyed the message that Matthew was \u201cin Hell\u2014sine\ndie.\u201d Id., at 3783.\n  Even if those who attended the funeral were not alerted\nin advance about respondents\u2019 intentions, the meaning of\nthese signs would not have been missed. Since respon\ndents chose to stage their protest at Matthew Snyder\u2019s\nfuneral and not at any of the other countless available\nvenues, a reasonable person would have assumed that\nthere was a connection between the messages on the\nplacards and the deceased. Moreover, since a church\nfuneral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts\nabout the afterlife, some of respondents\u2019 signs\u2014e.g., \u201cGod\nHates You,\u201d \u201cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Going\nto Hell\u201d\u2014would have likely been interpreted as referring\nto God\u2019s judgment of the deceased.\n  Other signs would most naturally have been understood\nas suggesting\u2014falsely\u2014that Matthew was gay. Homo\nsexuality was the theme of many of the signs. There were\nsigns reading \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d \u201cSemper Fi Fags,\u201d \u201cFags\nDoom Nations,\u201d and \u201cFag Troops.\u201d Id., at 3781\u20133787.\nAnother placard depicted two men engaging in anal inter\ncourse. A reasonable bystander seeing those signs would\nhave likely concluded that they were meant to suggest\nthat the deceased was a homosexual.\n  After the funeral, the Westboro picketers reaffirmed the\nmeaning of their protest. They posted an online account\nentitled \u201cThe Burden of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew A.\nSnyder. The Visit of Westboro Baptist Church to Help the\nInhabitants of Maryland Connect the Dots!\u201d Id., at 3788.15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 15 The   Court refuses to consider the epic because it was not discussed\n8                         SNYDER v.

Every dime\n     they gave the Roman Catholic monster they con\n     demned their own souls. They also, in supporting sa\n     tanic Catholicism, taught Matthew to be an idolater.\n         .           .           .         .            .\n       \u201cThen after all that they sent him to fight for the\n     United States of Sodom, a filthy country that is in lock\n     step with his evil, wicked, and sinful manner of life,\n     putting him in the cross hairs of a God that is so mad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nin Snyder\u2019s petition for certiorari. Ante, at 3, n. 1. The epic, however, is\nnot a distinct claim but a piece of evidence that the jury considered in\nimposing liability for the claims now before this Court. The protest and\nthe epic are parts of a single course of conduct that the jury found to\nconstitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. See 580 F. 3d,\nat 225 (\u201c[T]he Epic cannot be divorced from the general context of\nthe funeral protest\u201d). The Court\u2019s strange insistence that the epic \u201cis\nnot properly before us,\u201d ante, at 3, n. 1, means that the Court has not\nactually made \u201can independent examination of the whole record,\u201d ante,\nat 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court\u2019s refusal to\nconsider the epic contrasts sharply with its willingness to take notice of\nWestboro\u2019s protest activities at other times and locations. See ante,\nat 9.\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)      9\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n    He has smoke coming from his nostrils and fire from\n    his mouth! How dumb was that?\u201d Id., at 3791.\n   In light of this evidence, it is abundantly clear that\nrespondents, going far beyond commentary on matters of\npublic concern, specifically attacked Matthew Snyder\nbecause (1) he was a Catholic and (2) he was a member of\nthe United States military. Both Matthew and petitioner\nwere private figures,16 and this attack was not speech on a\nmatter of public concern. While commentary on the Cath\nolic Church or the United States military constitutes\nspeech on matters of public concern, speech regarding\nMatthew Snyder\u2019s purely private conduct does not.\n   JUSTICE BREYER provides an apt analogy to a case in\nwhich the First Amendment would permit recovery in tort\nfor a verbal attack:\n    \u201c[S]uppose that A were physically to assault B, know\n    ing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide\n    A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his\n    views on a matter of public concern. The constitu\n    tionally protected nature of the end would not shield\n    A\u2019s use of unlawful, unprotected means. And in some\n    circumstances the use of certain words as means\n    would be similarly unprotected.\u201d Ante, at 1 (concur\n    ring opinion).\n  This captures what respondents did in this case. In\ndeed, this is the strategy that they have routinely em\nployed\u2014and that they will now continue to employ\u2014\ninflicting severe and lasting emotional injury on an ever\ngrowing list of innocent victims.\n                         IV\n  The Court concludes that respondents\u2019 speech was\nprotected by the First Amendment for essentially three\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 16 See   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

PHELPS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nreasons, but none is sound.\n   First\u2014and most important\u2014the Court finds that \u201cthe\noverall thrust and dominant theme of [their] demonstra\ntion spoke to\u201d broad public issues. Ante, at 8. As I have\nattempted to show, this portrayal is quite inaccurate;\nrespondents\u2019 attack on Matthew was of central impor\ntance. But in any event, I fail to see why actionable\nspeech should be immunized simply because it is inter\nspersed with speech that is protected. The First Amend\nment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are\ninterspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters\nof public concern, and there is no good reason why respon\ndents\u2019 attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be\ntreated differently.\n   Second, the Court suggests that respondents\u2019 personal\nattack on Matthew Snyder is entitled to First Amendment\nprotection because it was not motivated by a private\ngrudge, see ante, at 9, but I see no basis for the strange\ndistinction that the Court appears to draw. Respondents\u2019\nmotivation\u2014\u201cto increase publicity for its views,\u201d ibid.\u2014did\nnot transform their statements attacking the character\nof a private figure into statements that made a contri\nbution to debate on matters of public concern. Nor did\ntheir publicity-seeking motivation soften the sting of their\nattack. And as far as culpability is concerned, one might\nwell think that wounding statements uttered in the heat\nof a private feud are less, not more, blameworthy than\nsimilar statements made as part of a cold and calculated\nstrategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting pub\nlic attention.\n   Third, the Court finds it significant that respondents\u2019\nprotest occurred on a public street, but this fact alone\nshould not be enough to preclude IIED liability. To be\nsure, statements made on a public street may be less\nlikely to satisfy the elements of the IIED tort than state\nments made on private property, but there is no reason\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwhy a public street in close proximity to the scene of a\nfuneral should be regarded as a free-fire zone in which\notherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded from\nliability. If the First Amendment permits the States to\nprotect their residents from the harm inflicted by such\nattacks\u2014and the Court does not hold otherwise\u2014then the\nlocation of the tort should not be dispositive. A physical\nassault may occur without trespassing; it is no defense\nthat the perpetrator had \u201cthe right to be where [he was].\u201d\nSee ante, at 11. And the same should be true with respect\nto unprotected speech. Neither classic \u201cfighting words\u201d\nnor defamatory statements are immunized when they\noccur in a public place, and there is no good reason to treat\na verbal assault based on the conduct or character of a\nprivate figure like Matthew Snyder any differently.\n   One final comment about the opinion of the Court is in\norder. The Court suggests that the wounds inflicted by\nvicious verbal assaults at funerals will be prevented or at\nleast mitigated in the future by new laws that restrict\npicketing within a specified distance of a funeral. See\nante, at 10\u201311. It is apparent, however, that the enact\nment of these laws is no substitute for the protection\nprovided by the established IIED tort; according to the\nCourt, the verbal attacks that severely wounded petitioner\nin this case complied with the new Maryland law regulat\ning funeral picketing. See ante, at 11, n. 5. And there is\nabsolutely nothing to suggest that Congress and the state\nlegislatures, in enacting these laws, intended them to\ndisplace the protection provided by the well-established\nIIED tort.\n   The real significance of these new laws is not that they\nobviate the need for IIED protection. Rather, their enact\nment dramatically illustrates the fundamental point that\nfunerals are unique events at which special protection\nagainst emotional assaults is in order. At funerals, the\nemotional well-being of bereaved relatives is particularly\n12                   SNYDER v. PHELPS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nvulnerable. See National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 168 (2004). Exploitation of a fu\nneral for the purpose of attracting public attention \u201cin\ntrud[es] upon their . . . grief,\u201d ibid., and may permanently\nstain their memories of the final moments before a loved\none is laid to rest. Allowing family members to have a few\nhours of peace without harassment does not undermine\npublic debate. I would therefore hold that, in this setting,\nthe First Amendment permits a private figure to recover\nfor the intentional infliction of emotional distress caused\nby speech on a matter of private concern.\n                              V\n  In reversing the District Court judgment in favor of\npetitioner, the Court of Appeals relied on several grounds\nnot discussed in the opinion of this Court or in the sepa\nrate opinion supporting affirmance. I now turn briefly to\nthose issues.\n  First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\nerred by allowing the jury to decide whether respondents\u2019\nspeech was \u201c \u2018directed specifically at the Snyder family.\u2019 \u201d\n580 F. 3d, at 221. It is not clear whether the Court of\nAppeals thought that this was a question for the trial\njudge alone or a question on which the judge had to make\na preliminary ruling before sending it to the jury. In\neither event, however, the submission of this question to\nthe jury was not reversible error because, as explained\nabove, it is clear that respondents\u2019 statements targeted the\nSnyders.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge\nwent astray in allowing the jury to decide whether re\nspondents\u2019 speech was so \u201c \u2018offensive and shocking as to\nnot be entitled to First Amendment protection.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\nThis instruction also did respondents no harm. Because\ntheir speech did not relate to a matter of public concern, it\nwas not protected from liability by the First Amendment,\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   13\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand the only question for the jury was whether the ele\nments of the IIED tort were met.\n   Third, the Court of Appeals appears to have concluded\nthat the First Amendment does not permit an IIED plain\ntiff to recover for speech that cannot reasonably be inter\npreted as stating actual facts about an individual. See id.,\nat 222. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals\nrelied on two of our cases\u2014Milkovich v. Lorain Journal\nCo., 497 U. S. 1 (1990), and Hustler, 485 U. S. 46\u2014but\nneither supports the broad proposition that the Court of\nAppeals adopted.\n   Milkovich was a defamation case, and falsity is an ele\nment of defamation. Nothing in Milkovich even hints that\nthe First Amendment requires that this defamation ele\nment be engrafted onto the IIED tort.\n   Hustler did involve an IIED claim, but the plaintiff\nthere was a public figure, and the Court did not suggest\nthat its holding would also apply in a case involving a\nprivate figure. Nor did the Court suggest that its holding\napplied across the board to all types of IIED claims. In\nstead, the holding was limited to \u201cpublications such as the\none here at issue,\u201d namely, a caricature in a magazine.\n485 U. S., at 56. Unless a caricature of a public figure can\nreasonably be interpreted as stating facts that may be\nproved to be wrong, the caricature does not have the same\npotential to wound as a personal verbal assault on a vul\nnerable private figure.\n   Because I cannot agree either with the holding of this\nCourt or the other grounds on which the Court of Appeals\nrelied, I would reverse the decision below and remand for\nfurther proceedings.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 The Court affirms the decision of the Fourth Circuit with respect to\n\npetitioner\u2019s claim of intrusion upon seclusion on a ground not addressed\nby the Fourth Circuit. I would not reach out to decide that issue but\nwould instead leave it for the Fourth Circuit to decide on remand. I\nwould likewise allow the Fourth Circuit on remand to decide whether\n14                       SNYDER v.

I\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nthe judgment on the claim of civil conspiracy can survive in light of the\n\nultimate disposition of the IIED and intrusion upon seclusion claims. \n\n</pre>",
