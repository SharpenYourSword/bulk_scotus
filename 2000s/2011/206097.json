KHOLI\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u2013868.      Argued November 29, 2010\u2014Decided March 7, 2011\nRespondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts\n  of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.\n  His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad\n  dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a\n  May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su\n  perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State\n  Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state\n  postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af\n  firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha\n  beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The\n  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen\n  erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the\n  date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A),\n  but \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col\n  lateral review\u201d tolls that period, \u00a72244(d)(2). Respondent\u2019s postcon\n  viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule\n  35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti\n  tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un\n  timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Rule 35\n  motion was not \u201ca properly filed application for . . . collateral review\u201d\n  under \u00a72244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\n    1. The phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) means judicial re\n view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.\n Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a\n motion to reduce sentence is an \u201capplication for State post-conviction\n2                            WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    or other collateral review\u201d turns on the meaning of \u201ccollateral re\n    view,\u201d but they disagree about what that meaning should be. Pp.\n    4\u20135.\n          (b) Because \u201ccollateral review\u201d is not defined in AEDPA, the\n    Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase. By\n    definition, \u201ccollateral\u201d describes something that is \u201cindirect,\u201d not di\n    rect. 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473. This suggests that \u201ccollat\n    eral\u201d review is not part of direct review. This conclusion is supported\n    by the definition of the related phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d and by the\n    Court\u2019s prior use of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe proceedings that\n    are separate from the direct review process. Pp. 5\u20137.\n          (c) The term \u201creview\u201d is best understood as a \u201cjudicial reexami\n    nation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1944. Pp.\n    7\u20138.\n       2. A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is\n    an application for \u201ccollateral review\u201d that triggers AEDPA\u2019s tolling\n    provision. Pp. 8\u201315.\n          (a) Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal\n    Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing\n    Reform Act of 1984. The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as\n    relevant here, to \u201creduce any sentence,\u201d and it is generally addressed\n    to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice. Under the limited\n    review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice\u2019s de\n    cision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly\n    disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses. Pp. 8\u20139.\n          (b) Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduc\n    tion proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d The parties agree that the motion is\n    not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower\n    federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old\n    Federal Rule 35 as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy. Therefore, it is\n    not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island\u2019s motion to reduce sen\n    tence is \u201ccollateral.\u201d A Rule 35 motion also calls for \u201creview\u201d of the\n    sentence within \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s meaning. The decision to reduce a sen\n    tence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine\n    whether a more lenient sentence is proper. The trial justice is guided\n    by several sentencing factors in making that decision. And those fac\n    tors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial\n    justice\u2019s justifications for the sentence. Pp. 9\u201311.\n          (c) Rhode Island\u2019s arguments in support of its opposing view that\n    \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d challenges to a conviction or\n    sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence re\n    duction, are unpersuasive. Nor does \u201ccollateral review\u201d turn on\n    whether a motion is part of the same criminal case. Pp. 11\u201315.\n582 F. 3d 147, affirmed.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

WALL, II, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND \n\n     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETI- \n\n            TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), \u201ca properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with re\nspect to the pertinent judgment or claim\u201d tolls the 1-year\nlimitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether\na motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls\nthe limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil\nKholi\u2019s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the\nphrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) means judicial\nreview of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of\ndirect review. Because the parties agree that a motion to\nreduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the\ndirect review process, we hold that respondent\u2019s motion\ntolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal\nhabeas petition was therefore timely.\n                         I\n                         A\n  In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island\n2                          WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSuperior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault,\nand he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life im\nprisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to\nhis conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of\nRhode Island affirmed his conviction. See State v. Kholi,\n672 A. 2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respon\ndent\u2019s conviction became final on direct review when his\ntime expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in\nthis Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respon\ndent 3, n. 1; 582 F. 3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally\nJimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court\u2019s Rules\n13.1, 13.3, 30.1.\n   In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed\ntwo state motions that are relevant to our decision. The\nfirst, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sen\ntence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure.1 App. 8. In that motion,\nrespondent asked the trial court to \u201creconsider its prior\ndetermination\u201d and \u201corder that his life sentences run\nconcurrently.\u201d State v. Kholi, 706 A. 2d 1326 (R. I. 1998)\n(order). Concluding that \u201cthe sentence imposed was ap\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 This Rule provides in relevant part:\n\n\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The court may\ncorrect a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and it may reduce any\nsentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120)\ndays after the sentence is imposed, or within one hundred and twenty\n(120) days after receipt by the court of a mandate of the Supreme Court\nof Rhode Island issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of\nthe appeal, or within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt\nby the court of a mandate or order of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates issued upon affirmance of the judgment, dismissal of the appeal,\nor denial of a writ of certiorari. The court shall act on the motion\nwithin a reasonable time, provided that any delay by the court in ruling\non the motion shall not prejudice the movant. The court may reduce a\nsentence, the execution of which has been suspended, upon revocation\nof probation.\u201d R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a) (2010) (emphasis\nadded).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npropriate,\u201d the hearing justice denied the Rule 35 motion.\nIbid. On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court\naffirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the\nsentence. Id., at 1326\u20131327.\n  On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend\ning, respondent also filed an application for state postcon\nviction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10\u20139.1\u20131 et seq. (Lexis\n1997) (titled \u201cPost Conviction Remedy\u201d), which challenged\nhis conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,\nand the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nDecember 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263\u2013\n264 (R. I. 2006).\n                              B\n   Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis\ntrict of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By\nthat time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.\nAEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be\nfiled within one year of the date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is\ntolled during the pendency of \u201ca properly filed application\nfor State post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2).\n   There is no dispute that respondent\u2019s application for\npostconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over\nnine years\u2014from May 23, 1997, through December 14,\n2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that\nstretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the\nperiod between the conclusion of direct review and the\nfiling of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.\nThus, in order for respondent\u2019s petition to be timely, the\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the\ntolling provision.\n   Respondent\u2019s federal habeas petition was referred to a\nMagistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and\n4                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion\nwas not a \u201c \u2018properly filed application for post-conviction or\nother collateral review\u2019 \u201d under \u00a72244(d)(2) because it was\n\u201ca \u2018plea of leniency,\u2019 and not a motion challenging the legal\nsufficiency of his sentence.\u201d No. CA 07\u2013346S, 2008 WL\n60194, *4 (R. I., Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted\nthe Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and\ntherefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as un\ntimely. See id., at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit re\nversed. 582 F. 3d 147.\n  The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question\nwhether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of\nlimitation under \u00a72244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to\nanswer this question with respect to a motion to reduce\nsentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  AEDPA establishes a 1-year period of limitation for a\nstate prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. \u00a72244(d)(1). This period runs \u201cfrom the\nlatest of\u201d four specified dates, including \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\nview.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A); see also Jimenez, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (explaining when \u201cthe conclusion of direct review\noccurs\u201d). The limitation period is tolled, however, during\nthe pendency of \u201ca properly filed application for State post\nconviction or other collateral review with respect to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Compare Alexander v.

The question\nin this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence\nunder Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is an \u201capplication for State\npost-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d\n   The parties agree that the answer to this question turns\non the meaning of the phrase \u201ccollateral review,\u201d see Brief\nfor Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12\u201313, but they\ndisagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island\nargues that \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d chal\nlenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo\ntions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon\ndent, on the other hand, maintains that \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nis \u201creview other than review of a judgment in the direct\nappeal process\u201d and thus includes motions to reduce sen\ntence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon\ndent\u2019s understanding of \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n                             B\n  \u201cCollateral review\u201d is not defined in AEDPA, and we\nhave never provided a comprehensive definition of that\nterm. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175\u2013178\n(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary\nunderstanding of the phrase \u201ccollateral review.\u201d See\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (\u201cWe give the\nwords of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to\nbear some different import\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219\n(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u201cpending\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2)).\n  The term \u201ccollateral,\u201d in its \u201ccustomary and preferred\nsense,\u201d Williams, supra, at 431, means \u201c[l]ying aside from\nthe main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .\nsubordinate, indirect,\u201d 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473\n(2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter\n6                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWebster\u2019s) (\u201caccompanying as . . . secondary,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d or\n\u201cancillary\u201d). By definition, something that is \u201ccollateral\u201d\nis \u201cindirect,\u201d not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that\n\u201ccollateral\u201d review is review that is \u201c[l]ying aside from the\nmain\u201d review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See\nibid.\n   The definition of the related phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d\npoints in the same direction. A \u201ccollateral attack\u201d is \u201c[a]n\nattack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct\nappeal.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em\nphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a710.73.090(2) (2008)\n(defining \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201cany form of postconviction\nrelief other than a direct appeal\u201d). This usage buttresses\nthe conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of\nreview that is not part of the direct appeal process.\n                              C\n    Our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d also supports\nthis understanding. We have previously described a vari\nety of proceedings as \u201ccollateral,\u201d and all of these proceed\nings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,\nthey stand apart from the process of direct review.\n    For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus\nis a form of collateral review. We have used the terms\nhabeas corpus and \u201ccollateral review\u201d interchangeably,\nsee, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482\u2013483 (1986),\nand it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas\ncorpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 272 (2005) (\u201c[T]he 1-year statute of limitations\n. . . was tolled while Rhines\u2019 state habeas corpus petition\nwas pending\u201d).\n    We have also described coram nobis as a means of \u201ccol\nlateral attack,\u201d see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346\nU. S. 502, 510\u2013511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), and we have used the term \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe\nproceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255 and a prior version of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\nUnited States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin\nguished between the process of direct appeal and \u201ca num\nber of collateral remedies,\u201d including Federal Rule 35\nmotions, \u00a72255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,\nn. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52\n(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a\n\u201c[d]irect attack\u201d on a criminal judgment and \u201ccollateral\nproceedings,\u201d such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and \u00a72255\nproceedings. Id., at 53\u201354.\n  All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions\nas \u201ccollateral\u201d are separate from the direct review process,\nand thus our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d but\ntresses the conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a\nform of review that is not direct.\n                              D\n  Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a \u201ccollateral\u201d\nproceeding must also involve a form of \u201creview,\u201d but the\nmeaning of that term seems clear. \u201cReview\u201d is best under\nstood as an \u201cact of inspecting or examining\u201d or a \u201cjudicial\nreexamination.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1944; see also Black\u2019s, supra,\nat 1434 (\u201c[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a\nsubject or thing\u201d); 13 OED 831 (\u201c[t]o submit (a decree, act,\netc.) to examination or revision\u201d). We thus agree with the\nFirst Circuit that \u201c \u2018review\u2019 commonly denotes \u2018a looking\nover or examination with a view to amendment or im\nprovement.\u2019 \u201d 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster\u2019s 1944\n(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, \u201ccollateral review\u201d of a\njudgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of\na judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct\nreview process.\n                         III\n We now apply this definition of \u201ccollateral review\u201d to a\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island\n8                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw.\n                              A\n   Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure\nis much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro\ncedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the\nfederal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga\ntion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.\nByrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re\nporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the\nRhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to\nprovide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court \u201cmay\u201d\n\u201ccorrect an illegal sentence,\u201d \u201ccorrect a sentence imposed\nin an illegal manner,\u201d and \u201creduce any sentence.\u201d R. I.\nSuper. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, supra. In this\ncase, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,\nwhich permits a trial justice to decide \u201c \u2018 \u201con reflection or\non the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence\noriginally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nState v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting\nState v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see\nalso Reporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.\nProc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620\u2013621.

Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island\nSupreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce\nsentence is \u201c \u2018addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\njustice\u2019 \u201d and that appellate review of the trial justice\u2019s\ndecision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men\ndoza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe\nless disturb the trial justice\u2019s decision \u201cwhen the trial\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njustice has imposed a sentence that is without justification\nand is grossly disparate from other sentences generally\nimposed for similar offenses.\u201d Ruffner, supra, at 867\n(quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009);\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su\npra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice \u201cabuse[d] his\ndiscretion\u201d).\n                               B\n   With these principles in mind, we consider whether\nRhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an\napplication for \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n   The first\u2014and the critical\u2014question is whether a Rhode\nIsland Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollat\neral.\u201d Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a\nmotion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,\nwe have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence\nunder old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy, see Robinson,\nsupra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to\nreduce sentence is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to former Fed\neral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have\nalso referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo\ntions as \u201ccollateral.\u201d See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,\n941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (\u201cFernandez initiated a\ncollateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion\nto reduce his sentence\u201d under the old Federal Rule). We\nthus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island\nsentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We  can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed\ning is in fact part of direct review under \u00a72244(d)(1) because, according\nto the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to\ntheir sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35\nmotion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (\u201cIt is\nwell settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence\nmust begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not\nconsider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless\n10                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode\nIsland law \u201ccollateral,\u201d but it also undoubtedly calls for\n\u201creview\u201d of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen\ntence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus\ntice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to\ndetermine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4\nWhen ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by\nseveral factors, including \u201c(1) the severity of the crime, (2)\nthe defendant\u2019s personal, educational, and employment\nbackground, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the\nelement of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness\nof the punishment.\u201d State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138\n(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at\n655. On appeal from a trial justice\u2019s decision on a motion\nto reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\nevaluates the trial justice\u2019s justifications in light of the\nrelevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen\ntence is \u201cwithout justification\u201d and \u201cgrossly disparate from\nother sentences.\u201d Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nextraordinary circumstances exist\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nState v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con\nsider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because \u201c[t]o\nchallenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to\nreduce in accordance with Rule 35\u201d); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,\n555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6\u20137). That issue has not been\nbriefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as\nto the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a\nRhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of\nthis case would not change: Respondent\u2019s habeas petition still would be\ntimely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until\nafter the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.\n  4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction\n\ndiscovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are\nnot direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide\na state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\n  5 E.g., State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 657 (R. I. 2009) (\u201cGiven these\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201creview\u201d of a sentence within the meaning of \u00a72244(d)(2).\n  We thus hold that a motion to reduce sentence under\nRhode Island law is an application for \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nthat triggers AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision.\n                             IV\n  In resisting this interpretation, Rhode Island advances\nseveral arguments that we find unpersuasive.\n  The first of these arguments begins by observing that,\nwhenever our opinions have used the precise phrase \u201ccol\nlateral review,\u201d the proceeding in question was one chal\nlenging the \u201clawfulness\u201d of a prior judgment, Brief for\nPetitioner 21\u201322, such as a \u00a72254 or \u00a72255 action, see id.,\nat 25. Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting\nAEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this\nusage and must have intended the phrase to carry this\nnarrow meaning.\n  This argument reads far too much into these prior refer\nences to \u201ccollateral review.\u201d While our opinions have used\nthe phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d to refer to proceedings that\nchallenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have\nnever suggested that the phrase may properly be used to\ndescribe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode\nIsland overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce\nsentence as \u201ccollateral.\u201d E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,\nn. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfactors, and the trial justice\u2019s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning\nin sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discre\ntion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences\u201d); State v.\nFerrara, 818 A. 2d 642, 645 (R. I. 2003) (per curiam) (\u201c[M]itigating\ncircumstances clearly are not present in this case\u201d); State v. Rossi, 771\nA. 2d 906, 908 (R. I. 2001) (order) (\u201cBased upon [the court\u2019s] review of\nthe record,\u201d the sentence \u201cwas not excessive and was justified under the\ncircumstances,\u201d namely, \u201cthe abhorrent conduct of [the] defendant\u201d and\n\u201cthe permissible penalty range\u201d under the statute); State v. Mollicone,\n746 A. 2d 135, 138 (R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he trial justice was\naware of these factors and applied them correctly\u201d).\n12                          WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nState Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \u00a7\u00a71:2,\n1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce\nsentence as a \u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201cpostconviction\u201d remedy).\n  In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several\nother AEDPA provisions use the term \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nto refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the\nlawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),6 and Rhode\nIsland reasons that the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in\n\u00a72244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.\nThis argument has the same flaw as the argument just\ndiscussed. Just because the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nencompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of\na prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings\nmay not also be described as involving \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n  Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the\ntolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust\nstate remedies and that this purpose is not served when a\nprisoner\u2019s state application merely seeks sentencing leni\nency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas\npetition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow\nunderstanding of \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s role.\n  It is certainly true that a purpose\u2014and perhaps the\nchief purpose\u2014of tolling under \u00a72244(d)(2) is to permit\nthe exhaustion of state remedies, see Duncan, 533 U. S., at\n178\u2013179, but that is not \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s only role. The toll\ning provision \u201cprovides a powerful incentive for litigants to\nexhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in\nthe lower federal courts.\u201d Id., at 180 (emphasis added).\nTolling the limitation period for all \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nmotions provides both litigants and States with an oppor\ntunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially\nobviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made\n\nretroactively applicable by this Court to \u201ccases on collateral review.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIf, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law\ngrounds, there may be no need for federal habeas. The\nsame dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to\nmotions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judg\nment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the\nneed for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even\nobviated, and this furthers principles of \u201ccomity, finality,\nand federalism.\u201d Williams, 529 U. S., at 436.\n   Rhode Island\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2) would also\ngreatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.\nRhode Island would require those courts to separate mo\ntions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that\nchallenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that\nmerely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problem\natic. Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to\nexercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence\nfrom within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily\nfollow that the judge\u2019s choice is insulated from challenge\non legal grounds. \u201c[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a\ncourt\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment\nis to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 \u201d Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting\nUnited States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC\nVa. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction\nprovides criteria to guide a trial judge\u2019s exercise of sen\ntencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue\nthat a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that\nsense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to\nsentencing law. See, e.g., Ruffner, 5 A. 3d, at 867 (\u201cA trial\njustice considers a number of factors when determining a\nfair sentence[,] including the defendant\u2019s potential for\nrehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice\ndid not consider defendant\u2019s participation in rehabilitative\nprograms\u201d (citations omitted)). We do not think that\n\u00a72244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to\ndraw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island\u2019s\n14                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation would demand.\n   We also reject the argument that the meaning of the\nphrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d should turn on whether the\nmotion or application that triggers that review is cap\ntioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro\nceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237\n(CA4 2001). This interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2) would\nproduce confusion and inconsistency.\n   For one thing, some \u201ccollateral\u201d proceedings are often\nregarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for\nexample, that a writ of coram nobis \u201cis a step in the crimi\nnal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin\nning of a separate civil proceeding.\u201d Morgan, 346 U. S., at\n505, n. 4; see also United States v. Denedo, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]n application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired\u201d).\nBut we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a\nmeans of \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d Morgan, supra, at 510\u2013511\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361\nU. S., at 230, n. 14. Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the\noriginal criminal case and is typically referred to the judge\nwho originally presided over the challenged proceedings,\nsee \u00a72255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that\n\u00a72255 proceedings are \u201ccollateral,\u201d see, e.g., Massaro v.\nUnited States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing \u00a72255\nproceedings as \u201ccollateral\u201d); Daniels v. United States, 532\nU.

See,\ne.g., Postconviction Remedies \u00a73:5, p. 251 (2010) (\u201c[T]here is a dispute\nover whether the [\u00a72255] motion initiates an independent civil action\nor, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution\u201d); 3 C.\nWright & S.

In the District of\nColumbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction\nremedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is\nnot. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief\nHandbook \u00a71:3, at 6\u20137. Given the States\u2019 \u201cdifferent forms\nof collateral review,\u201d Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap\nplication of AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision should not turn\non such formalities.

KHOLI\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u2013868.      Argued November 29, 2010\u2014Decided March 7, 2011\nRespondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts\n  of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.\n  His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad\n  dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a\n  May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su\n  perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State\n  Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state\n  postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af\n  firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha\n  beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The\n  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen\n  erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the\n  date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A),\n  but \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col\n  lateral review\u201d tolls that period, \u00a72244(d)(2). Respondent\u2019s postcon\n  viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule\n  35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti\n  tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un\n  timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Rule 35\n  motion was not \u201ca properly filed application for . . . collateral review\u201d\n  under \u00a72244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\n    1. The phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) means judicial re\n view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.\n Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a\n motion to reduce sentence is an \u201capplication for State post-conviction\n2                            WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    or other collateral review\u201d turns on the meaning of \u201ccollateral re\n    view,\u201d but they disagree about what that meaning should be. Pp.\n    4\u20135.\n          (b) Because \u201ccollateral review\u201d is not defined in AEDPA, the\n    Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase. By\n    definition, \u201ccollateral\u201d describes something that is \u201cindirect,\u201d not di\n    rect. 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473. This suggests that \u201ccollat\n    eral\u201d review is not part of direct review. This conclusion is supported\n    by the definition of the related phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d and by the\n    Court\u2019s prior use of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe proceedings that\n    are separate from the direct review process. Pp. 5\u20137.\n          (c) The term \u201creview\u201d is best understood as a \u201cjudicial reexami\n    nation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1944. Pp.\n    7\u20138.\n       2. A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is\n    an application for \u201ccollateral review\u201d that triggers AEDPA\u2019s tolling\n    provision. Pp. 8\u201315.\n          (a) Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal\n    Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing\n    Reform Act of 1984. The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as\n    relevant here, to \u201creduce any sentence,\u201d and it is generally addressed\n    to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice. Under the limited\n    review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice\u2019s de\n    cision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly\n    disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses. Pp. 8\u20139.\n          (b) Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduc\n    tion proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d The parties agree that the motion is\n    not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower\n    federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old\n    Federal Rule 35 as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy. Therefore, it is\n    not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island\u2019s motion to reduce sen\n    tence is \u201ccollateral.\u201d A Rule 35 motion also calls for \u201creview\u201d of the\n    sentence within \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s meaning. The decision to reduce a sen\n    tence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine\n    whether a more lenient sentence is proper. The trial justice is guided\n    by several sentencing factors in making that decision. And those fac\n    tors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial\n    justice\u2019s justifications for the sentence. Pp. 9\u201311.\n          (c) Rhode Island\u2019s arguments in support of its opposing view that\n    \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d challenges to a conviction or\n    sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence re\n    duction, are unpersuasive. Nor does \u201ccollateral review\u201d turn on\n    whether a motion is part of the same criminal case. Pp. 11\u201315.\n582 F. 3d 147, affirmed.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

WALL, II, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND \n\n     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETI- \n\n            TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), \u201ca properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with re\nspect to the pertinent judgment or claim\u201d tolls the 1-year\nlimitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether\na motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls\nthe limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil\nKholi\u2019s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the\nphrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2) means judicial\nreview of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of\ndirect review. Because the parties agree that a motion to\nreduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the\ndirect review process, we hold that respondent\u2019s motion\ntolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal\nhabeas petition was therefore timely.\n                         I\n                         A\n  In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island\n2                          WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSuperior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault,\nand he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life im\nprisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to\nhis conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of\nRhode Island affirmed his conviction. See State v. Kholi,\n672 A. 2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respon\ndent\u2019s conviction became final on direct review when his\ntime expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in\nthis Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respon\ndent 3, n. 1; 582 F. 3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally\nJimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court\u2019s Rules\n13.1, 13.3, 30.1.\n   In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed\ntwo state motions that are relevant to our decision. The\nfirst, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sen\ntence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure.1 App. 8. In that motion,\nrespondent asked the trial court to \u201creconsider its prior\ndetermination\u201d and \u201corder that his life sentences run\nconcurrently.\u201d State v. Kholi, 706 A. 2d 1326 (R. I. 1998)\n(order). Concluding that \u201cthe sentence imposed was ap\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 This Rule provides in relevant part:\n\n\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The court may\ncorrect a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and it may reduce any\nsentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120)\ndays after the sentence is imposed, or within one hundred and twenty\n(120) days after receipt by the court of a mandate of the Supreme Court\nof Rhode Island issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of\nthe appeal, or within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt\nby the court of a mandate or order of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates issued upon affirmance of the judgment, dismissal of the appeal,\nor denial of a writ of certiorari. The court shall act on the motion\nwithin a reasonable time, provided that any delay by the court in ruling\non the motion shall not prejudice the movant. The court may reduce a\nsentence, the execution of which has been suspended, upon revocation\nof probation.\u201d R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.

S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npropriate,\u201d the hearing justice denied the Rule 35 motion.\nIbid. On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court\naffirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the\nsentence. Id., at 1326\u20131327.\n  On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend\ning, respondent also filed an application for state postcon\nviction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10\u20139.1\u20131 et seq. (Lexis\n1997) (titled \u201cPost Conviction Remedy\u201d), which challenged\nhis conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,\nand the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nDecember 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263\u2013\n264 (R. I. 2006).\n                              B\n   Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis\ntrict of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By\nthat time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.\nAEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be\nfiled within one year of the date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is\ntolled during the pendency of \u201ca properly filed application\nfor State post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2).\n   There is no dispute that respondent\u2019s application for\npostconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over\nnine years\u2014from May 23, 1997, through December 14,\n2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that\nstretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the\nperiod between the conclusion of direct review and the\nfiling of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.\nThus, in order for respondent\u2019s petition to be timely, the\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the\ntolling provision.\n   Respondent\u2019s federal habeas petition was referred to a\nMagistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and\n4                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion\nwas not a \u201c \u2018properly filed application for post-conviction or\nother collateral review\u2019 \u201d under \u00a72244(d)(2) because it was\n\u201ca \u2018plea of leniency,\u2019 and not a motion challenging the legal\nsufficiency of his sentence.\u201d No. CA 07\u2013346S, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">60194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4 (R. I., Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted\nthe Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and\ntherefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as un\ntimely. See id., at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit re\nversed. 582 F. 3d 147.\n  The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question\nwhether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of\nlimitation under \u00a72244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to\nanswer this question with respect to a motion to reduce\nsentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  AEDPA establishes a 1-year period of limitation for a\nstate prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. \u00a72244(d)(1). This period runs \u201cfrom the\nlatest of\u201d four specified dates, including \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\nview.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A); see also Jimenez, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (explaining when \u201cthe conclusion of direct review\noccurs\u201d). The limitation period is tolled, however, during\nthe pendency of \u201ca properly filed application for State post\nconviction or other collateral review with respect to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Compare Alexander v.

The question\nin this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence\nunder Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is an \u201capplication for State\npost-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d\n   The parties agree that the answer to this question turns\non the meaning of the phrase \u201ccollateral review,\u201d see Brief\nfor Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12\u201313, but they\ndisagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island\nargues that \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d chal\nlenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo\ntions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon\ndent, on the other hand, maintains that \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nis \u201creview other than review of a judgment in the direct\nappeal process\u201d and thus includes motions to reduce sen\ntence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon\ndent\u2019s understanding of \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n                             B\n  \u201cCollateral review\u201d is not defined in AEDPA, and we\nhave never provided a comprehensive definition of that\nterm. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175\u2013178\n(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary\nunderstanding of the phrase \u201ccollateral review.\u201d See\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (\u201cWe give the\nwords of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to\nbear some different import\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219\n(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u201cpending\u201d in \u00a72244(d)(2)).\n  The term \u201ccollateral,\u201d in its \u201ccustomary and preferred\nsense,\u201d Williams, supra, at 431, means \u201c[l]ying aside from\nthe main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .\nsubordinate, indirect,\u201d 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473\n(2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter\n6                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWebster\u2019s) (\u201caccompanying as . . . secondary,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d or\n\u201cancillary\u201d). By definition, something that is \u201ccollateral\u201d\nis \u201cindirect,\u201d not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that\n\u201ccollateral\u201d review is review that is \u201c[l]ying aside from the\nmain\u201d review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See\nibid.\n   The definition of the related phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d\npoints in the same direction. A \u201ccollateral attack\u201d is \u201c[a]n\nattack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct\nappeal.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em\nphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a710.73.090(2) (2008)\n(defining \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201cany form of postconviction\nrelief other than a direct appeal\u201d). This usage buttresses\nthe conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of\nreview that is not part of the direct appeal process.\n                              C\n    Our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d also supports\nthis understanding. We have previously described a vari\nety of proceedings as \u201ccollateral,\u201d and all of these proceed\nings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,\nthey stand apart from the process of direct review.\n    For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus\nis a form of collateral review. We have used the terms\nhabeas corpus and \u201ccollateral review\u201d interchangeably,\nsee, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482\u2013483 (1986),\nand it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas\ncorpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 272 (2005) (\u201c[T]he 1-year statute of limitations\n. . . was tolled while Rhines\u2019 state habeas corpus petition\nwas pending\u201d).\n    We have also described coram nobis as a means of \u201ccol\nlateral attack,\u201d see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346\nU. S. 502, 510\u2013511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), and we have used the term \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe\nproceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255 and a prior version of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\nUnited States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin\nguished between the process of direct appeal and \u201ca num\nber of collateral remedies,\u201d including Federal Rule 35\nmotions, \u00a72255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,\nn. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52\n(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a\n\u201c[d]irect attack\u201d on a criminal judgment and \u201ccollateral\nproceedings,\u201d such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and \u00a72255\nproceedings. Id., at 53\u201354.\n  All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions\nas \u201ccollateral\u201d are separate from the direct review process,\nand thus our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d but\ntresses the conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a\nform of review that is not direct.\n                              D\n  Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a \u201ccollateral\u201d\nproceeding must also involve a form of \u201creview,\u201d but the\nmeaning of that term seems clear. \u201cReview\u201d is best under\nstood as an \u201cact of inspecting or examining\u201d or a \u201cjudicial\nreexamination.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1944; see also Black\u2019s, supra,\nat 1434 (\u201c[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a\nsubject or thing\u201d); 13 OED 831 (\u201c[t]o submit (a decree, act,\netc.) to examination or revision\u201d). We thus agree with the\nFirst Circuit that \u201c \u2018review\u2019 commonly denotes \u2018a looking\nover or examination with a view to amendment or im\nprovement.\u2019 \u201d 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster\u2019s 1944\n(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, \u201ccollateral review\u201d of a\njudgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of\na judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct\nreview process.\n                         III\n We now apply this definition of \u201ccollateral review\u201d to a\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island\n8                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw.\n                              A\n   Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure\nis much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro\ncedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the\nfederal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga\ntion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.\nByrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re\nporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the\nRhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to\nprovide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court \u201cmay\u201d\n\u201ccorrect an illegal sentence,\u201d \u201ccorrect a sentence imposed\nin an illegal manner,\u201d and \u201creduce any sentence.\u201d R. I.\nSuper. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, supra. In this\ncase, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,\nwhich permits a trial justice to decide \u201c \u2018 \u201con reflection or\non the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence\noriginally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nState v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting\nState v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see\nalso Reporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.\nProc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620\u2013621.

Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island\nSupreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce\nsentence is \u201c \u2018addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\njustice\u2019 \u201d and that appellate review of the trial justice\u2019s\ndecision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men\ndoza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe\nless disturb the trial justice\u2019s decision \u201cwhen the trial\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njustice has imposed a sentence that is without justification\nand is grossly disparate from other sentences generally\nimposed for similar offenses.\u201d Ruffner, supra, at 867\n(quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009);\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su\npra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice \u201cabuse[d] his\ndiscretion\u201d).\n                               B\n   With these principles in mind, we consider whether\nRhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an\napplication for \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n   The first\u2014and the critical\u2014question is whether a Rhode\nIsland Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollat\neral.\u201d Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a\nmotion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,\nwe have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence\nunder old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy, see Robinson,\nsupra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to\nreduce sentence is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to former Fed\neral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have\nalso referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo\ntions as \u201ccollateral.\u201d See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,\n941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (\u201cFernandez initiated a\ncollateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion\nto reduce his sentence\u201d under the old Federal Rule). We\nthus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island\nsentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We  can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed\ning is in fact part of direct review under \u00a72244(d)(1) because, according\nto the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to\ntheir sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35\nmotion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (\u201cIt is\nwell settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence\nmust begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not\nconsider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless\n10                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode\nIsland law \u201ccollateral,\u201d but it also undoubtedly calls for\n\u201creview\u201d of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen\ntence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus\ntice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to\ndetermine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4\nWhen ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by\nseveral factors, including \u201c(1) the severity of the crime, (2)\nthe defendant\u2019s personal, educational, and employment\nbackground, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the\nelement of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness\nof the punishment.\u201d State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138\n(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at\n655. On appeal from a trial justice\u2019s decision on a motion\nto reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\nevaluates the trial justice\u2019s justifications in light of the\nrelevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen\ntence is \u201cwithout justification\u201d and \u201cgrossly disparate from\nother sentences.\u201d Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nextraordinary circumstances exist\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nState v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con\nsider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because \u201c[t]o\nchallenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to\nreduce in accordance with Rule 35\u201d); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,\n555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6\u20137). That issue has not been\nbriefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as\nto the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a\nRhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of\nthis case would not change: Respondent\u2019s habeas petition still would be\ntimely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until\nafter the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.\n  4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction\n\ndiscovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are\nnot direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide\na state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\n  5 E.g., State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 657 (R. I. 2009) (\u201cGiven these\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting\nAEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this\nusage and must have intended the phrase to carry this\nnarrow meaning.\n  This argument reads far too much into these prior refer\nences to \u201ccollateral review.\u201d While our opinions have used\nthe phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d to refer to proceedings that\nchallenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have\nnever suggested that the phrase may properly be used to\ndescribe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode\nIsland overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce\nsentence as \u201ccollateral.\u201d E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,\nn. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfactors, and the trial justice\u2019s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning\nin sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discre\ntion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences\u201d); State v.\nFerrara, 818 A. 2d 642, 645 (R. I. 2003) (per curiam) (\u201c[M]itigating\ncircumstances clearly are not present in this case\u201d); State v. Rossi, 771\nA. 2d 906, 908 (R. I. 2001) (order) (\u201cBased upon [the court\u2019s] review of\nthe record,\u201d the sentence \u201cwas not excessive and was justified under the\ncircumstances,\u201d namely, \u201cthe abhorrent conduct of [the] defendant\u201d and\n\u201cthe permissible penalty range\u201d under the statute); State v. Mollicone,\n746 A. 2d 135, 138 (R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he trial justice was\naware of these factors and applied them correctly\u201d).\n12                          WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nState Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \u00a7\u00a71:2,\n1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce\nsentence as a \u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201cpostconviction\u201d remedy).\n  In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several\nother AEDPA provisions use the term \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nto refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the\nlawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),6 and Rhode\nIsland reasons that the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in\n\u00a72244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.\nThis argument has the same flaw as the argument just\ndiscussed. Just because the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nencompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of\na prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings\nmay not also be described as involving \u201ccollateral review.\u201d\n  Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the\ntolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust\nstate remedies and that this purpose is not served when a\nprisoner\u2019s state application merely seeks sentencing leni\nency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas\npetition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow\nunderstanding of \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s role.\n  It is certainly true that a purpose\u2014and perhaps the\nchief purpose\u2014of tolling under \u00a72244(d)(2) is to permit\nthe exhaustion of state remedies, see Duncan, 533 U. S., at\n178\u2013179, but that is not \u00a72244(d)(2)\u2019s only role. The toll\ning provision \u201cprovides a powerful incentive for litigants to\nexhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in\nthe lower federal courts.\u201d Id., at 180 (emphasis added).\nTolling the limitation period for all \u201ccollateral review\u201d\nmotions provides both litigants and States with an oppor\ntunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially\nobviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made\n\nretroactively applicable by this Court to \u201ccases on collateral review.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIf, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law\ngrounds, there may be no need for federal habeas. The\nsame dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to\nmotions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judg\nment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the\nneed for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even\nobviated, and this furthers principles of \u201ccomity, finality,\nand federalism.\u201d Williams, 529 U. S., at 436.\n   Rhode Island\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2) would also\ngreatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.\nRhode Island would require those courts to separate mo\ntions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that\nchallenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that\nmerely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problem\natic. Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to\nexercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence\nfrom within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily\nfollow that the judge\u2019s choice is insulated from challenge\non legal grounds. \u201c[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a\ncourt\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment\nis to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 \u201d Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting\nUnited States v. Burr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761527\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761527/state-v-burr/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

If the law of a jurisdiction\nprovides criteria to guide a trial judge\u2019s exercise of sen\ntencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue\nthat a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that\nsense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to\nsentencing law. See, e.g., Ruffner, 5 A. 3d, at 867 (\u201cA trial\njustice considers a number of factors when determining a\nfair sentence[,] including the defendant\u2019s potential for\nrehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice\ndid not consider defendant\u2019s participation in rehabilitative\nprograms\u201d (citations omitted)). We do not think that\n\u00a72244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to\ndraw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island\u2019s\n14                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation would demand.\n   We also reject the argument that the meaning of the\nphrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d should turn on whether the\nmotion or application that triggers that review is cap\ntioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro\nceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237\n(CA4 2001). This interpretation of \u00a72244(d)(2) would\nproduce confusion and inconsistency.\n   For one thing, some \u201ccollateral\u201d proceedings are often\nregarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for\nexample, that a writ of coram nobis \u201cis a step in the crimi\nnal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin\nning of a separate civil proceeding.\u201d Morgan, 346 U.

S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]n application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired\u201d).\nBut we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a\nmeans of \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d Morgan, supra, at 510\u2013511\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361\nU.

C.\n\u00a72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the\noriginal criminal case and is typically referred to the judge\nwho originally presided over the challenged proceedings,\nsee \u00a72255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that\n\u00a72255 proceedings are \u201ccollateral,\u201d see, e.g., Massaro v.\nUnited States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing \u00a72255\nproceedings as \u201ccollateral\u201d); Daniels v. United States, 532\nU.

See,\ne.g., Postconviction Remedies \u00a73:5, p. 251 (2010) (\u201c[T]here is a dispute\nover whether the [\u00a72255] motion initiates an independent civil action\nor, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution\u201d); 3 C.\nWright & S.

In the District of\nColumbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction\nremedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is\nnot. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief\nHandbook \u00a71:3, at 6\u20137. Given the States\u2019 \u201cdifferent forms\nof collateral review,\u201d Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap\nplication of AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision should not turn\non such formalities.

KHALIL KHOLI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part. \n\n  The Court holds that the term \u201ccollateral review\u201d in 28\n\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2) means review that is not direct, ante,\nat 5, and that a motion under Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35\nseeks collateral review, ante, at 9. Because I agree with\nthose conclusions, I cannot join footnote 3 of the Court\u2019s\nopinion, ante, at 9, n. 3, which declines to decide whether a\nRule 35 motion seeks direct review.\n</pre>",
