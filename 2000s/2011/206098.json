SWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR\n        31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–9000. Argued October 13, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nDistrict Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S.\n  ___, ___, left unresolved the question whether a convicted state pris\n  oner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence may assert that\n  claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 or may assert\n  the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas cor\n  pus under 28 U. S. C. §2254.\n     A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to\n  death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons. He claimed that a\n  potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to com\n  mit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend’s uncle as the\n  likely perpetrator. In preparation for trial, the State tested some of\n  the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including\n  knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, finger\n  nail clippings, and certain hair samples. More than six years later,\n  Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconvic\n  tion DNA testing in limited circumstances. Invoking Article 64,\n  Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested\n  biological evidence. Both motions were denied. The Texas Court of\n  Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the\n  ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article\n  64.03(a)(2), that he “would not have been convicted if exculpatory re\n  sults had been obtained through DNA testing.” The CCA affirmed\n  the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown,\n  as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previ\n  ously tested “through no fault” on his part.\n     Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief\n  under §1983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District\n2                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to\n    have tested. Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\n    Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA\n    testing he requested. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal\n    of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postcon\n    viction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas cor\n    pus, not under §1983. Adopting that recommendation, the District\n    Court dismissed Skinner’s suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner’s\n complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.\n Pp. 7–15.\n     (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a\n plausible “short and plain” statement of the plaintiff’s claim, not an\n exposition of his legal argument. Skinner stated his due process\n claim in a paragraph alleging that the State’s refusal “to release the\n biological evidence for testing . . . deprived [him] of his liberty inter\n ests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction\n and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .” His coun\n sel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor’s con\n duct or the CCA’s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas’ postconvic\n tion DNA statute “as construed” by the Texas courts. Pp. 7–8.\n     (b) The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinner’s suit. This\n Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it\n takes its name, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, District of\n Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462. See Exxon\n Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280. Given\n “the narrow ground” the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has\n confined Rooker-Feldman “to cases . . . brought by state-court losers\n . . . inviting district court review and rejection of [a state court’s]\n judgments.” Ibid. Skinner’s complaint encounters no Rooker-\n Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s] [an] independent\n claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction\n that the “same or a related question” was earlier aired between the\n parties in state court. Id., at 292–293. A state-court decision is not\n reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing\n the decision may be challenged in a federal action. See, e.g.,\n Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487. Because Skinner’s federal case—which\n challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute\n they authoritatively construed—falls within the latter category, there\n was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.\n Pp. 8–10.\n     (c) Measured against this Court’s prior holdings, Skinner has prop\n erly invoked §1983. This Court has several times considered when a\n state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pur\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nsue a civil rights claim under §1983, and when habeas corpus is the\nprisoner’s sole remedy. The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a §1983\naction for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investi\ngated, arrested, tried, and convicted. This Court held that §1983 was\nnot an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff’s favor\nwould “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. See id., at\n487. In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held\nthat prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative\ndecisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under §1983,\nfor they sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier re\nlease into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable judgment\n[would] not ‘necessarily imply’ the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or\nsentence[s],” ibid. Here, success in Skinner’s suit for DNA testing\nwould not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. Test\nresults might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevita\nble, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.\nSwitzer argues that, although Skinner’s immediate aim is DNA test\ning, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for at\ntacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court\nhas recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought\nwould not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce\nthe custody level. Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in\nthe Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for DNA testing, there\nhas been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evi\ndence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment. The pro\njected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding\nDNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process\nas a basis for such claims. More generally, in the Prison Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits\nin order to prevent sportive federal-court filings. Nor is there cause\nfor concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady, which announced a consti\ntutional requirement addressed to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial,\nproscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an accused” and “mate\nrial to [his] guilt or to punishment.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\nUnlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or\ninconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evi\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within\nthe traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of\n§1983. Pp. 10–14.\n  (d) Switzer’s several arguments why Skinner’s complaint should\nfail for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for\nconsideration on remand.

Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 12–13): May a convicted state prisoner\nseeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that\nclaim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, or is\nsuch a claim cognizable in federal court only when as­\nserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. §2254? The Courts of Appeals have returned\ndiverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d\n89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza­\nble under §1983); Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 669 (CA7\n2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290–1291\n(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370,\n375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under §1983) and\nKutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339, 341 (CA5\n2002) (per curiam) (same).\n  In Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005), we compre­\nhensively surveyed this Court’s decisions on the respective\n2                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovinces of §1983 civil rights actions and §2254 federal\nhabeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we\nreaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks “immediate or\nspeedier release” from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the\nprisoner’s claim would not “necessarily spell speedier\nrelease,” however, suit may be brought under §1983. Ibid.\nAdhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon­\nviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a\n§1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner\nonly access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul­\npatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a\njudgment that simply orders DNA tests “necessarily\nimpl[y] the unlawfulness of the State’s custody.” Id., at\n81. We note, however, that the Court’s decision in Os\nborne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner\nmay bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten­\nsion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to\nshow that the governing state law denies him procedural\ndue process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                             I\n   In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin­\nner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in\ngirlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was\nbludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons\nwere stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the\nhouse Busby shared with Skinner.\n   Skinner never denied his presence in the house when\nthe killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was\nincapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.\nThe potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at\ntrial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal\nmurders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a\nlikely perpetrator, Busby’s uncle, Robert Donnell (now\ndeceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).\nThe CCA’s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in\ndetail:\n     “As they approached the house . . . , the police noticed\n     a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the\n     front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear\n     on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.\n     Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila’s\n     dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle\n     stained with blood and hair was leaning against the\n     couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con­\n     taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains\n     on it was laying between the couch and the coffee\n     table.\n       “[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where\n     [Busby’s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The\n     officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the\n     upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A\n     door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility\n     room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody\n     handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the\n     frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint\n     on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen\n     to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the\n     door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.\n       “[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found\n     him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks\n——————\n  1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill­\n\nings, Busby had spurned Donnell’s “rude sexual advances.” Skinner v.\nState, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related\nat a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or\ntwo after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his\npickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5\n2008).\n4                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     and blood-stained blue jeans.” Id., at 536.\nInvestigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from\nBusby.\n   In preparation for trial, “the State tested the blood on\n[Skinner’s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that\npartially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one\nof the victim’s back and cheeks.” Skinner v. State, 122\nS. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also\ntested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence—\nincluding bloody palm prints in the room where one victim\nwas killed—implicated Skinner, but “fingerprints on a bag\ncontaining one of the knives” did not. Ibid. Items left\nuntested included the knives found on the premises, the\naxe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi­\ntional hair samples. See ibid.2\n   In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc­\ncessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.\nSee Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),\ncert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor­\nmal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence\nthe police had collected at the scene of the crime.3\n   In 2001, more than six years after Skinner’s conviction,\nTexas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to\ngain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.\n——————\n  2 After Skinner’s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer­\n\ntain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection\nof those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these\nex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint ¶19, App. 12 (this\n“testing raised more questions than it answered”). But see Skinner v.\nState, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were\n“inculpatory”).\n  3 Skinner’s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence\n\nremained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,\nSkinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings\ntaken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby’s\nbody, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at\nthe crime scene.

Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.\n2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner\nmust meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show\nthat, at trial, testing either was “not available” or was\n“available, but not technologically capable of providing\nprobative results.” Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he\nmay show that the evidence was not previously tested\n“through no fault” on his part, and that “the interests of\njustice” require a postconviction order for testing. Art.\n64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test­\ning, a court must make further findings, prime among\nthem, the movant “would not have been convicted if excul­\npatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,”\nand “the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea­\nsonably delay the execution of sentence or administration\nof justice.” Art. 64.03(a)(2).\n   Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,\nfirst in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet\nuntested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both\nmotions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner’s\nfirst motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon­\nstrate a “reasonable probability . . . that he would not have\nbeen . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa­\ntory.” Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.\n   Skinner’s second motion was bolstered by discovery he\nhad obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the\ndenial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground\nthat Skinner failed to meet the “no fault” requirement.\nSee Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur­\n——————\n  4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an\n\nexpert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two\nsons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby’s right\nhand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint ¶27, App.\n18.\n  5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner’s second motion, in­\n\nformed the Texas district court that “[t]o the best of the State’s infor­\n6                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun­\nsel testified that he had not “ask[ed] for testing because he\nwas afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner’s].” Id.,\nat 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted “a\nreasonable trial strategy” that the court had no cause to\nsecond-guess. Id., at 209.\n   Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc­\ntive relief under §1983, naming as defendant respondent\nLynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose­\ncuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner\nwould like to have DNA tested. Skinner’s federal-court\ncomplaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to due process by refusing to provide for\nthe DNA testing he requested. Complaint ¶33, App. 20–\n21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted. App. 24–41. Under the governing Circuit\nprecedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for\nDNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not\nunder §1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s\nrecommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner’s\nsuit. Id., at 44–45.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per\ncuriam), reiterating that “an action by a prisoner for post­\nconviction DNA testing is not cognizable under §1983 and\nmust instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus,” id., at 303. On Skinner’s petition,6 we granted\n——————\nmation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still\navailable for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in\na condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert\nopinion in that regard.” Record 202.

Skinner’s com­\nplaint is not a model of the careful drafter’s art, but under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not\npin plaintiff’s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.\nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener­\nally requires only a plausible “short and plain” statement\nof the plaintiff’s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu­\nment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &\nProcedure §1219, pp. 277–278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.\n2010).\n  Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph\nalleging that the State’s refusal “to release the biological\nevidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty\ninterests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of\nhis conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his\nsentence . . . .” Complaint ¶33, App. 20–21. As earlier\nrecounted, see supra, at 5–6, Skinner had twice requested\nand failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law\nprocedure then available to him. See Complaint ¶¶22–31,\nApp. 14–20.7 At oral argument in this Court, Skinner’s\ncounsel clarified the gist of Skinner’s due process claim:\nHe does not challenge the prosecutor’s conduct or the\n\n——————\n  7 He also persistently sought the State’s voluntary testing of the ma­\n\nterials he identified. See Complaint ¶31, App. 20.\n8                         SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndecisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his\nmotions; instead, he challenges, as denying him proce­\ndural due process, Texas’ postconviction DNA statute “as\nconstrued” by the Texas courts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See\nalso id., at 52 (Texas courts, Skinner’s counsel argued,\nhave “construed the statute to completely foreclose any\nprisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to\ntrial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing” postconviction).8\n   The merits of Skinner’s federal-court complaint assail­\ning the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and\nparticularly the vitality of his claim in light of Osborne,\nsee supra, at 2—unaddressed by the District Court or the\nFifth Circuit—are not ripe for review. We take up here\nonly the questions whether there is federal-court subject­\nmatter jurisdiction over Skinner’s complaint, and whether\nthe claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.\n                               B\n   Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner’s challenge is\n“[j]urisdictionally [b]arred” by what has come to be known\nas the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48–\n49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we\nconclude that Rooker-Feldman does not bar Skinner’s suit.\n   As we explained in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005), the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only\ntwice, i.e., only in the two cases from which the doctrine\ntakes its name: first, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\nU. S. 413 (1923), then 60 years later, District of Columbia\n\n——————\n  8 Unlike the petitioner in District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial\n\nDist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), who “attempt[ed] to sidestep\nstate process through . . . a federal lawsuit,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),\nSkinner first resorted to state court, see supra, at 5–6. In this respect,\nSkinner is better positioned to urge in federal court “the inadequacy of\nthe state-law procedures available to him in state postconviction relief.”\nOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both\ncases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed\nsuit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings\nended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court\njudgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of\nthat judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the\nplaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court\nto overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,\nin both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject­\nmatter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. §1257\n“vests authority to review a state court’s judgment solely\nin this Court.” See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.\n   We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\nhad been construed by some federal courts “to extend far\nbeyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.”\nId., at 283. Emphasizing “the narrow ground” occupied by\nthe doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that Rooker-\nFeldman “is confined to cases of the kind from which the\ndoctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court\nlosers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of\n[the state court’s] judgments.” Ibid.\n   Skinner’s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no\nRooker-Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s]\n[an] independent claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the\nexercise of federal jurisdiction that the “same or a related\nquestion” was earlier aired between the parties in state\ncourt. id., at 292–293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,\n995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);\nsee In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen­\ndant’s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law pro­\ncedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the\n——————\n  9 The judgment assailed in Feldman was rendered by the District of\n\nColumbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state’s\nhighest court.\n10                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“limited grasp” of Rooker-Feldman).\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 7–8, Skinner does not\nchallenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,\nhe targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they\nauthoritatively construed. As the Court explained in\nFeldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544\nU. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by\nlower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the\ndecision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner’s\nfederal case falls within the latter category. There was,\ntherefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin­\nner’s federal suit.11\n                             C\n   When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu­\ntional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under\n§1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner’s sole\nremedy? This Court has several times considered that\nquestion. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512\nU. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state\nprisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a\n§1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been\nunlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.\nAlthough the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages\nonly, not release from confinement, we ruled that the\nplaintiff could not proceed under §1983. Any award in his\nfavor, we observed, would “necessarily imply” the invalid­\n——————\n  10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292–293 (2005), that “[w]hen there is\nparallel state and federal litigation,” state preclusion law may become\ndecisive, but “[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”\n  11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in\n\nthe Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,\n“Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,” Lance v.\nDennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu­\nsion unresolved below are “best left for full airing and decision on\nremand,” id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When “a judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,” the Court held, §1983 is not\nan available remedy. Ibid. “But if . . . the plaintiff’s ac­\ntion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity\nof [his conviction or sentence], the [§1983] action should be\nallowed to proceed . . . .” Ibid.\n   We summarized the relevant case law most recently in\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in­\nvolved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of\nadministrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.\nThey could proceed under §1983, the Court held, for they\nsought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier\nrelease into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable\njudgment [would] not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of\n[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],’ ” ibid. (quoting Heck,\n512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).\n   Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop­\nerly invoked §1983. Success in his suit for DNA testing\nwould not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his convic­\ntion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that\noutcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might\nfurther incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU. S. 637, 647 (2004) (“[W]e were careful in Heck to stress\nthe importance of the term ‘necessarily.’ ”).12\n   Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with\nFifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,\nthat Skinner’s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if\nat all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a §1983\naction. The dissent echoes Switzer’s argument. See post,\nat 3. Although Skinner’s immediate plea is simply for an\n——————\n  12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and\n\ninstead would instruct district courts to resort to “first principles” each\ntime a state prisoner files a §1983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.\n12                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\norder requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer\nurges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking\nhis conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has\nfound no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has\nrecognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available\none, where the relief sought would “neither terminat[e]\ncustody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus­\ntody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.” Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Respondent Switzer and her amici forecast that a “vast\nexpansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue” were we\nto hold that Skinner’s complaint can be initiated under\n§1983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa­\ntion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a\nproliferation of federal civil actions “seeking postconviction\ndiscovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ­\nated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.”\nId., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are\nunwarranted.13\n   In the Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for\nDNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by\nSwitzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The\n\n——————\n  13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n\n544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner’s require inquiry\ninto the State’s proof at trial and therefore lie at “the core of the crimi­\nnal proceeding itself.” Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33–34. Dotson de­\nclared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner’s claim\nwould not “necessarily spell speedier release,” that claim does not lie at\n“the core of habeas corpus,” and may be brought, if at all, under §1983.\n544 U. S., at 82 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee id., at 85–86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Whatever might be said of\nSwitzer’s argument were we to recast our doctrine, Switzer’s position\ncannot be reconciled with the line our precedent currently draws. Nor\ncan the dissent’s advocacy of a “retur[n] to first principles.” Post, at 7.\nGiven the importance of providing clear guidance to the lower courts,\n“we again see no reason for moving the line our cases draw.” Dotson,\n544 U.

See\nsupra, at 2.\n   More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321–66, Congress has placed a\nseries of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to\nprevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA\n§803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. §1997e to create new proce­\ndures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under §1983);\nPLRA §804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(b)(1) to require\nany prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full\nfiling fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account);\nPLRA §804(c)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(f) to require\nprisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed\nagainst them out of their prison trust account); PLRA\n§804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(g) to revoke, with lim­\nited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris­\noner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state\na claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596–597 (1998) (PLRA aims to\n“discourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely\nto succeed,” and statistics suggest that the Act is “having\nits intended effect”).\n   Nor do we see any cause for concern that today’s ruling\nwill spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373\nU. S. 83 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion.\nBrady announced a constitutional requirement addressed\nfirst and foremost to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial.\nBrady proscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an\naccused” and “material to [his] guilt or to punishment.”\nCone v.

Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281–282 (1999); see\nBanks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 691 (2004).\n   Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,\nincriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,\nwhen successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi­\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by\ndefinition, always favorable to the defendant and material\nto his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at\n296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic­\ntion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for\n“immediate or speedier release” from imprisonment. See\nDotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have\nranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and\noutside the province of §1983. See Heck, 512 U. S., at\n479, 490 (claim that prosecutors and an investigator had\n“ ‘knowingly destroyed’ evidence ‘which was exculpatory in\nnature and could have proved [petitioner’s] innocence’ ”\ncannot be maintained under §1983); Amaker v.

Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (§1983 should not “expand\nopportunities for collateral attack”). But this Court has\nnever purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of\n§1983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each\nclaim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi\nples and our prior decisions.\n  In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis\nputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use §1983\nto “challeng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on\nfederal constitutional grounds.” 411 U. S., at 489. This\nincluded attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486\n(“den[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial”). From there,\nthe Court reasoned that “immediate release from [physi\n\n——————\npostconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a\nstate habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See\nArd v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does\nnot itself “provide a vehicle for obtaining relief,” Ex parte Tuley, 109\nS. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and\nby nature part of Texas’ collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 8 (“Because [Article 64] does not give the convicting court\nauthority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a\nhabeas proceeding to challenge the conviction”).\n  Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner’s due process chal\nlenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a\nmotion under Article 64 is an “application for . . . collateral review”\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(2). See Wall v. Kholi, post, at 10, n. 4\n(noting that an application for review must “provide a state court with\nauthority to order relief from a judgment”). Texas has divided postcon\nviction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for state habeas\ninto separate proceedings, but both remain parts of the State’s collat\neral review process.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

S., at 483. De\ntermining that such actions were not covered by Preiser,\nwe returned to “the hoary principle that civil tort actions\nare not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments,” 512 U. S., at 486, and\nconcluded that a complaint must be dismissed where “a\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence,” id., at 487.\nMost recently, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 82\n(2005), we applied the principles from these prior decisions\nand found cognizable under §1983 a claim that sought to\n“render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole\neligibility . . . and parole suitability.”\n                             II\n   We have not previously addressed whether due process\nchallenges to state collateral review procedures may be\nbrought under §1983, and I would hold that they may not.\nChallenges to all state procedures for reviewing the valid\nity of a conviction should be treated the same as chal\nlenges to state trial procedures, which we have already\nrecognized may not be brought under §1983.

SWITZER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nestablish and review the validity of a conviction. This has\nlong been recognized for direct appellate review:\n    “And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re\n    quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re\n    view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that\n    where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner\n    has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel\n    late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process\n    of law under which he is held in custody by the State,\n    and to be considered in determining any question of\n    alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the\n    Fourteenth Amendment.” Frank v. Mangum, 237\n    U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).\nSimilarly, although a State is not required to provide\nprocedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that\nwhen state collateral review procedures are provided for,\nthey too are part of the “process of law under which [a\nprisoner] is held in custody by the State.” Ibid. As this\nCourt has explained, when considering whether the State\nhas provided all the process that is due in depriving an\nindividual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both\npre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of\nEd. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (“[T]he\nexistence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the\nnecessary scope of pretermination procedures”); see also\nNational Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason\nthis Court should refuse to allow §1983 suits to challenge\npart of this process—the trial proceedings—but bless the\nuse of §1983 to challenge other parts.\n  Collateral review procedures are, of course, “not part of\nthe criminal proceeding itself.” Pennsylvania v. Finley,\n481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel\nlate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTrial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner;\nappellate procedures review the validity of that conviction\nbefore it becomes final; and collateral review procedures\npermit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For\npurposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds\nof §1983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all\nconstitutional challenges to procedures concerning the\nvalidity of a conviction. See Heck, supra, at 491 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring) (“[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between\nhabeas and §1983], provided that it does so in a principled\nfashion”).\n   Second, “principles of federalism and comity [are] at\nstake” when federal courts review state collateral review\nprocedures, just as when they review state trial proce\ndures. Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2). An attack in federal court on any “state\njudicial action” concerning a state conviction must proceed\nwith “proper respect for state functions,” because the\nfederal courts are being asked to “tr[y] the regularity of\nproceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.”\nPreiser, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted).\n   Because of these concerns for federal-state comity,\nCongress has strictly limited the procedures for federal\nhabeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas\ndecisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner\nmay seek relief in federal court, he must “exhaus[t] the\nremedies available in the courts of the State.” 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive\nsignificant deference in subsequent federal habeas pro\nceedings. §2254(d). These requirements ensure that the\nstate courts have the first opportunity to correct any error\nwith a state conviction and that their rulings receive due\nrespect in subsequent federal challenges.\n   By bringing a procedural challenge under §1983, Skin\n6                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner\nhas never presented his current challenge to Texas’ proce\ndures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allow\ning Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas\nprocedures instead of an attack on state habeas results\nundercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have\nplaced on federal review of state convictions. See Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To\nallege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on\ncollateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas\npetition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions\nand deferential review. But a successful challenge to\nTexas’ collateral review procedures under §1983 would\nimpeach the result of collateral review without complying\nwith any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.\n  The majority contends that its decision will not “spill\nover to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963).” Ante, at 13; but cf. Osborne, supra, at ___–___\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3–5). In truth, the\nmajority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state\nhabeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under §1983: After\nstate habeas is denied, file a §1983 suit challenging the\nstate habeas process rather than the result. What pris\noner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the\napple?3\n\n\n——————\n  3 Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court’s holding will be\n\ncabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss\nwhether a State’s direct review process may be subject to challenge\nunder §1983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct\nand collateral review. This risks transforming §1983 into a vehicle for\ndirect criminal appeals. Cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 486\n(1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort\nto §1983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will\nunsuccessful appellants turn to §1983 to challenge the state appellate\nprocedures.\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011) \n               7\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              III \n\n   The majority relies on Dotson to reach its conclusion. In\nthat case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in\nstate parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and\n“a new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally\nproper procedures.” 544 U. S., at 77. We found the claims\ncognizable under §1983.\n   Dotson does not control this case. Unlike state collateral\nreview, parole does not evaluate the validity of the under\nlying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review per\nmits prisoners to “attack their final convictions.” Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). In\ncontrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a\nprisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the\nunderlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correct\nness of Dotson, parole procedures do not review the valid\nity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting\nreview of parole procedures does not similarly risk trans\nforming §1983 into a vehicle for “challenging the validity\nof outstanding criminal judgments.” Heck, 512 U. S., at\n486.\n   Contrary to the majority’s contention, Dotson did not\nreduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under\n§1983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner’s claim\nwould “necessarily spell speedier release.” See ante, at 11,\n12, n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).4 As we\nrecognized in Heck, evaluating the boundaries of §1983 is\nnot a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief\nsought was not “speedier release,” we inquired further\nand returned to first principles to determine that the chal\n——————\n  4 Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a con\n\nviction, a “necessarily spell speedier release” test may sufficiently\nsummarize the analysis of §1983 challenges to parole procedures. But\n“necessarily spell speedier release” cannot be the only limit when a\nprisoner challenges procedures used to review the validity of the\nunderlying conviction.\n8                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlenge in that case was not cognizable under §1983.5 See\n512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck\napproach, which I would continue to follow here, was\nincorrect.\n                         *    *    *\n   This Court has struggled to limit §1983 and prevent it\nfrom intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In\ncrafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek\ning “immediate or speedier release” from confinement fall\noutside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another\nlimit when faced with a civil action in which “a judgment\nin favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva\nlidity of his conviction or sentence.” Heck, supra, at 487.\nThis case calls for yet another: due process challenges to\nstate procedures used to review the validity of a conviction\nor sentence. Under that rule, Skinner’s claim is not cogni\nzable under §1983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  5 As respondent argued, our existing formulations are not “the end of\n\nthe test.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33.\n</pre>", "id": 206098, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/03/07/Skinner_v._Switzer.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 13, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nDistrict Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S.\n  ___, ___, left unresolved the question whether a convicted state pris\n  oner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence may assert that\n  claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 or may assert\n  the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas cor\n  pus under 28 U. S. C. §2254.\n     A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to\n  death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons. He claimed that a\n  potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to com\n  mit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend’s uncle as the\n  likely perpetrator. In preparation for trial, the State tested some of\n  the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including\n  knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, finger\n  nail clippings, and certain hair samples. More than six years later,\n  Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconvic\n  tion DNA testing in limited circumstances. Invoking Article 64,\n  Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested\n  biological evidence. Both motions were denied. The Texas Court of\n  Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the\n  ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article\n  64.03(a)(2), that he “would not have been convicted if exculpatory re\n  sults had been obtained through DNA testing.” The CCA affirmed\n  the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown,\n  as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previ\n  ously tested “through no fault” on his part.\n     Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief\n  under §1983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District\n2                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to\n    have tested. Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\n    Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA\n    testing he requested. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal\n    of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postcon\n    viction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas cor\n    pus, not under §1983. Adopting that recommendation, the District\n    Court dismissed Skinner’s suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner’s\n complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.\n Pp. 7–15.\n     (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a\n plausible “short and plain” statement of the plaintiff’s claim, not an\n exposition of his legal argument. Skinner stated his due process\n claim in a paragraph alleging that the State’s refusal “to release the\n biological evidence for testing . . . deprived [him] of his liberty inter\n ests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction\n and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .” His coun\n sel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor’s con\n duct or the CCA’s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas’ postconvic\n tion DNA statute “as construed” by the Texas courts. Pp. 7–8.\n     (b) The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinner’s suit. This\n Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it\n takes its name, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, District of\n Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462. See Exxon\n Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280. Given\n “the narrow ground” the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has\n confined Rooker-Feldman “to cases . . . brought by state-court losers\n . . . inviting district court review and rejection of [a state court’s]\n judgments.” Ibid. Skinner’s complaint encounters no Rooker-\n Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s] [an] independent\n claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction\n that the “same or a related question” was earlier aired between the\n parties in state court. Id., at 292–293. A state-court decision is not\n reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing\n the decision may be challenged in a federal action. See, e.g.,\n Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487. Because Skinner’s federal case—which\n challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute\n they authoritatively construed—falls within the latter category, there\n was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.\n Pp. 8–10.\n     (c) Measured against this Court’s prior holdings, Skinner has prop\n erly invoked §1983. This Court has several times considered when a\n state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pur\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nsue a civil rights claim under §1983, and when habeas corpus is the\nprisoner’s sole remedy. The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a §1983\naction for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investi\ngated, arrested, tried, and convicted. This Court held that §1983 was\nnot an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff’s favor\nwould “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. See id., at\n487. In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held\nthat prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative\ndecisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under §1983,\nfor they sought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier re\nlease into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable judgment\n[would] not ‘necessarily imply’ the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or\nsentence[s],” ibid. Here, success in Skinner’s suit for DNA testing\nwould not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his conviction. Test\nresults might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevita\nble, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.\nSwitzer argues that, although Skinner’s immediate aim is DNA test\ning, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for at\ntacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court\nhas recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought\nwould not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce\nthe custody level. Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in\nthe Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for DNA testing, there\nhas been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evi\ndence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment. The pro\njected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding\nDNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process\nas a basis for such claims. More generally, in the Prison Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits\nin order to prevent sportive federal-court filings. Nor is there cause\nfor concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady, which announced a consti\ntutional requirement addressed to the prosecution’s conduct pretrial,\nproscribes withholding evidence “favorable to an accused” and “mate\nrial to [his] guilt or to punishment.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\nUnlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or\ninconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evi\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within\nthe traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of\n§1983.

Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 12–13): May a convicted state prisoner\nseeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that\nclaim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, or is\nsuch a claim cognizable in federal court only when as­\nserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. §2254? The Courts of Appeals have returned\ndiverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d\n89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza­\nble under §1983); Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 669 (CA7\n2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290–1291\n(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v.

SWITZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovinces of §1983 civil rights actions and §2254 federal\nhabeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we\nreaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks “immediate or\nspeedier release” from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the\nprisoner’s claim would not “necessarily spell speedier\nrelease,” however, suit may be brought under §1983. Ibid.\nAdhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon­\nviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a\n§1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner\nonly access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul­\npatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a\njudgment that simply orders DNA tests “necessarily\nimpl[y] the unlawfulness of the State’s custody.” Id., at\n81. We note, however, that the Court’s decision in Os\nborne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner\nmay bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten­\nsion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to\nshow that the governing state law denies him procedural\ndue process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                             I\n   In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin­\nner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in\ngirlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was\nbludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons\nwere stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the\nhouse Busby shared with Skinner.\n   Skinner never denied his presence in the house when\nthe killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was\nincapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.\nThe potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at\ntrial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal\nmurders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a\nlikely perpetrator, Busby’s uncle, Robert Donnell (now\ndeceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).\nThe CCA’s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in\ndetail:\n     “As they approached the house . . . , the police noticed\n     a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the\n     front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear\n     on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.\n     Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila’s\n     dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle\n     stained with blood and hair was leaning against the\n     couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con­\n     taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains\n     on it was laying between the couch and the coffee\n     table.\n       “[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where\n     [Busby’s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds.

W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related\nat a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or\ntwo after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his\npickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5\n2008).\n4                      SKINNER v.

State, 122\nS. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also\ntested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence—\nincluding bloody palm prints in the room where one victim\nwas killed—implicated Skinner, but “fingerprints on a bag\ncontaining one of the knives” did not. Ibid. Items left\nuntested included the knives found on the premises, the\naxe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi­\ntional hair samples. See ibid.2\n   In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc­\ncessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.\nSee Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),\ncert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor­\nmal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence\nthe police had collected at the scene of the crime.3\n   In 2001, more than six years after Skinner’s conviction,\nTexas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to\ngain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.\n——————\n  2 After Skinner’s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer­\n\ntain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection\nof those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these\nex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint ¶19, App. 12 (this\n“testing raised more questions than it answered”). But see Skinner v.\nState, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were\n“inculpatory”).\n  3 Skinner’s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence\n\nremained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,\nSkinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings\ntaken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby’s\nbody, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at\nthe crime scene.

Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.\n2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner\nmust meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show\nthat, at trial, testing either was “not available” or was\n“available, but not technologically capable of providing\nprobative results.” Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he\nmay show that the evidence was not previously tested\n“through no fault” on his part, and that “the interests of\njustice” require a postconviction order for testing. Art.\n64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test­\ning, a court must make further findings, prime among\nthem, the movant “would not have been convicted if excul­\npatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,”\nand “the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea­\nsonably delay the execution of sentence or administration\nof justice.” Art. 64.03(a)(2).\n   Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,\nfirst in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet\nuntested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both\nmotions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner’s\nfirst motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon­\nstrate a “reasonable probability . . . that he would not have\nbeen . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa­\ntory.” Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.\n   Skinner’s second motion was bolstered by discovery he\nhad obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the\ndenial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground\nthat Skinner failed to meet the “no fault” requirement.\nSee Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur­\n——————\n  4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an\n\nexpert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two\nsons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby’s right\nhand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint ¶27, App.\n18.\n  5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner’s second motion, in­\n\nformed the Texas district court that “[t]o the best of the State’s infor­\n6                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun­\nsel testified that he had not “ask[ed] for testing because he\nwas afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner’s].” Id.,\nat 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted “a\nreasonable trial strategy” that the court had no cause to\nsecond-guess. Id., at 209.\n   Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc­\ntive relief under §1983, naming as defendant respondent\nLynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose­\ncuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner\nwould like to have DNA tested. Skinner’s federal-court\ncomplaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to due process by refusing to provide for\nthe DNA testing he requested. Complaint ¶33, App. 20–\n21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted. App. 24–41. Under the governing Circuit\nprecedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for\nDNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not\nunder §1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge’s\nrecommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner’s\nsuit. Id., at 44–45.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per\ncuriam), reiterating that “an action by a prisoner for post­\nconviction DNA testing is not cognizable under §1983 and\nmust instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus,” id., at 303. On Skinner’s petition,6 we granted\n——————\nmation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still\navailable for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in\na condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert\nopinion in that regard.” Record 202.

Rhodes, 416 U. S.\n232, 236 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient\nto cross the federal court’s threshold, see Swierkiewicz v.\nSorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner’s com­\nplaint is not a model of the careful drafter’s art, but under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not\npin plaintiff’s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.\nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener­\nally requires only a plausible “short and plain” statement\nof the plaintiff’s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu­\nment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &\nProcedure §1219, pp. 277–278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.\n2010).\n  Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph\nalleging that the State’s refusal “to release the biological\nevidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty\ninterests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of\nhis conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his\nsentence . . . .” Complaint ¶33, App. 20–21. As earlier\nrecounted, see supra, at 5–6, Skinner had twice requested\nand failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law\nprocedure then available to him. See Complaint ¶¶22–31,\nApp. 14–20.7 At oral argument in this Court, Skinner’s\ncounsel clarified the gist of Skinner’s due process claim:\nHe does not challenge the prosecutor’s conduct or the\n\n——————\n  7 He also persistently sought the State’s voluntary testing of the ma­\n\nterials he identified.

SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndecisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his\nmotions; instead, he challenges, as denying him proce­\ndural due process, Texas’ postconviction DNA statute “as\nconstrued” by the Texas courts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See\nalso id., at 52 (Texas courts, Skinner’s counsel argued,\nhave “construed the statute to completely foreclose any\nprisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to\ntrial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing” postconviction).8\n   The merits of Skinner’s federal-court complaint assail­\ning the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and\nparticularly the vitality of his claim in light of Osborne,\nsee supra, at 2—unaddressed by the District Court or the\nFifth Circuit—are not ripe for review. We take up here\nonly the questions whether there is federal-court subject­\nmatter jurisdiction over Skinner’s complaint, and whether\nthe claim he presses is cognizable under §1983.\n                               B\n   Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner’s challenge is\n“[j]urisdictionally [b]arred” by what has come to be known\nas the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48–\n49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we\nconclude that Rooker-Feldman does not bar Skinner’s suit.\n   As we explained in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005), the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only\ntwice, i.e., only in the two cases from which the doctrine\ntakes its name: first, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\nU. S. 413 (1923), then 60 years later, District of Columbia\n\n——————\n  8 Unlike the petitioner in District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial\n\nDist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), who “attempt[ed] to sidestep\nstate process through . . . a federal lawsuit,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),\nSkinner first resorted to state court, see supra, at 5–6. In this respect,\nSkinner is better positioned to urge in federal court “the inadequacy of\nthe state-law procedures available to him in state postconviction relief.”\nOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both\ncases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed\nsuit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings\nended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court\njudgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of\nthat judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the\nplaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court\nto overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,\nin both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject­\nmatter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. §1257\n“vests authority to review a state court’s judgment solely\nin this Court.” See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.\n   We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\nhad been construed by some federal courts “to extend far\nbeyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.”\nId., at 283. Emphasizing “the narrow ground” occupied by\nthe doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that Rooker-\nFeldman “is confined to cases of the kind from which the\ndoctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court\nlosers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of\n[the state court’s] judgments.” Ibid.\n   Skinner’s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no\nRooker-Feldman shoal. “If a federal plaintiff ‘present[s]\n[an] independent claim,’ ” it is not an impediment to the\nexercise of federal jurisdiction that the “same or a related\nquestion” was earlier aired between the parties in state\ncourt. id., at 292–293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,\n995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);\nsee In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen­\ndant’s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law pro­\ncedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the\n——————\n  9 The judgment assailed in Feldman was rendered by the District of\n\nColumbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state’s\nhighest court.\n10                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n“limited grasp” of Rooker-Feldman).\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 7–8, Skinner does not\nchallenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,\nhe targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they\nauthoritatively construed. As the Court explained in\nFeldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544\nU. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by\nlower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the\ndecision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner’s\nfederal case falls within the latter category. There was,\ntherefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin­\nner’s federal suit.11\n                             C\n   When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu­\ntional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under\n§1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner’s sole\nremedy? This Court has several times considered that\nquestion. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512\nU. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state\nprisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a\n§1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been\nunlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.\nAlthough the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages\nonly, not release from confinement, we ruled that the\nplaintiff could not proceed under §1983. Any award in his\nfavor, we observed, would “necessarily imply” the invalid­\n——————\n  10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292–293 (2005), that “[w]hen there is\nparallel state and federal litigation,” state preclusion law may become\ndecisive, but “[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”\n  11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in\n\nthe Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,\n“Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,” Lance v.\nDennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu­\nsion unresolved below are “best left for full airing and decision on\nremand,” id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When “a judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,” the Court held, §1983 is not\nan available remedy. Ibid. “But if . . . the plaintiff’s ac­\ntion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity\nof [his conviction or sentence], the [§1983] action should be\nallowed to proceed . . . .” Ibid.\n   We summarized the relevant case law most recently in\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in­\nvolved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of\nadministrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.\nThey could proceed under §1983, the Court held, for they\nsought no “injunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier\nrelease into the community,” id., at 82, and “a favorable\njudgment [would] not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of\n[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],’ ” ibid. (quoting Heck,\n512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).\n   Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop­\nerly invoked §1983. Success in his suit for DNA testing\nwould not “necessarily imply” the invalidity of his convic­\ntion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that\noutcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might\nfurther incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU. S. 637, 647 (2004) (“[W]e were careful in Heck to stress\nthe importance of the term ‘necessarily.’ ”).12\n   Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with\nFifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,\nthat Skinner’s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if\nat all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a §1983\naction. The dissent echoes Switzer’s argument. See post,\nat 3. Although Skinner’s immediate plea is simply for an\n——————\n  12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and\n\ninstead would instruct district courts to resort to “first principles” each\ntime a state prisoner files a §1983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.\n12                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\norder requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer\nurges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking\nhis conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has\nfound no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has\nrecognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available\none, where the relief sought would “neither terminat[e]\ncustody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus­\ntody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.” Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Respondent Switzer and her amici forecast that a “vast\nexpansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue” were we\nto hold that Skinner’s complaint can be initiated under\n§1983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa­\ntion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a\nproliferation of federal civil actions “seeking postconviction\ndiscovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ­\nated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.”\nId., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are\nunwarranted.13\n   In the Circuits that currently allow §1983 claims for\nDNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by\nSwitzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The\n\n——————\n  13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n\n544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner’s require inquiry\ninto the State’s proof at trial and therefore lie at “the core of the crimi­\nnal proceeding itself.” Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33–34. Dotson de­\nclared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner’s claim\nwould not “necessarily spell speedier release,” that claim does not lie at\n“the core of habeas corpus,” and may be brought, if at all, under §1983.\n544 U. S., at 82 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee id., at 85–86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Whatever might be said of\nSwitzer’s argument were we to recast our doctrine, Switzer’s position\ncannot be reconciled with the line our precedent currently draws. Nor\ncan the dissent’s advocacy of a “retur[n] to first principles.” Post, at 7.\nGiven the importance of providing clear guidance to the lower courts,\n“we again see no reason for moving the line our cases draw.” Dotson,\n544 U.

See\nsupra, at 2.\n   More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321–66, Congress has placed a\nseries of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to\nprevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA\n§803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. §1997e to create new proce­\ndures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under §1983);\nPLRA §804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(b)(1) to require\nany prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full\nfiling fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account);\nPLRA §804(c)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(f) to require\nprisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed\nagainst them out of their prison trust account); PLRA\n§804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. §1915(g) to revoke, with lim­\nited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris­\noner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state\na claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596–597 (1998) (PLRA aims to\n“discourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely\nto succeed,” and statistics suggest that the Act is “having\nits intended effect”).\n   Nor do we see any cause for concern that today’s ruling\nwill spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373\nU.

Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281–282 (1999); see\nBanks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 691 (2004).\n   Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,\nincriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,\nwhen successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi­\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by\ndefinition, always favorable to the defendant and material\nto his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at\n296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic­\ntion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for\n“immediate or speedier release” from imprisonment. See\nDotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have\nranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and\noutside the province of §1983. See Heck, 512 U. S., at\n479, 490 (claim that prosecutors and an investigator had\n“ ‘knowingly destroyed’ evidence ‘which was exculpatory in\nnature and could have proved [petitioner’s] innocence’ ”\ncannot be maintained under §1983); Amaker v.

I\ndisagree.1 I accept the majority’s characterization of the\nissue here as the question left open in District Attorney’s\nOffice for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), ante, at 1, where a prisoner challenged the consti\ntutional adequacy of the access to DNA evidence provided\nby Alaska’s “general postconviction relief statute,” 557\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Like Osborne, Skinner seeks\nto challenge state collateral review procedures.2 I would\n——————\n  1 I adopt the majority’s view that Skinner has alleged a violation of\n\nprocedural due process despite the fact that his complaint is more\nnaturally read as alleging a violation of substantive due process. I also\nignore the questionable premise that the requested relief—DNA test\ning—would be available in a procedural due process challenge. Com\npare Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 77 (2005) (seeking “a new parole\nhearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures”), with\nOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4,\nn. 1) (distinguishing Dotson because Osborne sought “ ‘exculpatory’\nevidence”).\n  2 Skinner challenges Texas’ Article 64, Tex. Code Crim.

SWITZER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnow hold that these claims are not cognizable under\n§1983.\n                               I\n  The Court has recognized that §1983 does not reach to\nthe full extent of its “broad language.” Preiser v. Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (§1983 should not “expand\nopportunities for collateral attack”). But this Court has\nnever purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of\n§1983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each\nclaim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi\nples and our prior decisions.\n  In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis\nputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use §1983\nto “challeng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on\nfederal constitutional grounds.” 411 U. S., at 489. This\nincluded attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486\n(“den[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial”). From there,\nthe Court reasoned that “immediate release from [physi\n\n——————\npostconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a\nstate habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See\nArd v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does\nnot itself “provide a vehicle for obtaining relief,” Ex parte Tuley, 109\nS. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and\nby nature part of Texas’ collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 8 (“Because [Article 64] does not give the convicting court\nauthority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a\nhabeas proceeding to challenge the conviction”).\n  Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner’s due process chal\nlenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a\nmotion under Article 64 is an “application for . . . collateral review”\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(2). See Wall v. Kholi, post, at 10, n. 4\n(noting that an application for review must “provide a state court with\nauthority to order relief from a judgment”). Texas has divided postcon\nviction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for state habeas\ninto separate proceedings, but both remain parts of the State’s collat\neral review process.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974) (refusing to allow a\n§1983 suit for restoration of good-time credits); Edwards v.\nBalisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997) (refusing to allow a §1983\nprocedural challenge to the process used to revoke good\ntime credits). Then, in Heck v. Humphrey, we addressed\n§1983 actions seeking damages. 512 U. S., at 483. De\ntermining that such actions were not covered by Preiser,\nwe returned to “the hoary principle that civil tort actions\nare not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments,” 512 U. S., at 486, and\nconcluded that a complaint must be dismissed where “a\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence,” id., at 487.\nMost recently, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 82\n(2005), we applied the principles from these prior decisions\nand found cognizable under §1983 a claim that sought to\n“render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole\neligibility . . . and parole suitability.”\n                             II\n   We have not previously addressed whether due process\nchallenges to state collateral review procedures may be\nbrought under §1983, and I would hold that they may not.\nChallenges to all state procedures for reviewing the valid\nity of a conviction should be treated the same as chal\nlenges to state trial procedures, which we have already\nrecognized may not be brought under §1983. Moreover,\nallowing such challenges under §1983 would undermine\nCongress’ strict limitations on federal review of state\nhabeas decisions. If cognizable at all, Skinner’s claim\nsounds in habeas corpus.\n   First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the\nprocess of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all\nprocedures—including collateral review procedures—that\n4                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nestablish and review the validity of a conviction. This has\nlong been recognized for direct appellate review:\n    “And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re\n    quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re\n    view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that\n    where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner\n    has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel\n    late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process\n    of law under which he is held in custody by the State,\n    and to be considered in determining any question of\n    alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the\n    Fourteenth Amendment.” Frank v. Mangum, 237\n    U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).\nSimilarly, although a State is not required to provide\nprocedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that\nwhen state collateral review procedures are provided for,\nthey too are part of the “process of law under which [a\nprisoner] is held in custody by the State.” Ibid. As this\nCourt has explained, when considering whether the State\nhas provided all the process that is due in depriving an\nindividual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both\npre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of\nEd. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (“[T]he\nexistence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the\nnecessary scope of pretermination procedures”); see also\nNational Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason\nthis Court should refuse to allow §1983 suits to challenge\npart of this process—the trial proceedings—but bless the\nuse of §1983 to challenge other parts.\n  Collateral review procedures are, of course, “not part of\nthe criminal proceeding itself.” Pennsylvania v. Finley,\n481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel\nlate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTrial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner;\nappellate procedures review the validity of that conviction\nbefore it becomes final; and collateral review procedures\npermit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For\npurposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds\nof §1983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all\nconstitutional challenges to procedures concerning the\nvalidity of a conviction. See Heck, supra, at 491 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring) (“[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between\nhabeas and §1983], provided that it does so in a principled\nfashion”).\n   Second, “principles of federalism and comity [are] at\nstake” when federal courts review state collateral review\nprocedures, just as when they review state trial proce\ndures. Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2). An attack in federal court on any “state\njudicial action” concerning a state conviction must proceed\nwith “proper respect for state functions,” because the\nfederal courts are being asked to “tr[y] the regularity of\nproceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.”\nPreiser, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted).\n   Because of these concerns for federal-state comity,\nCongress has strictly limited the procedures for federal\nhabeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas\ndecisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner\nmay seek relief in federal court, he must “exhaus[t] the\nremedies available in the courts of the State.” 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive\nsignificant deference in subsequent federal habeas pro\nceedings. §2254(d). These requirements ensure that the\nstate courts have the first opportunity to correct any error\nwith a state conviction and that their rulings receive due\nrespect in subsequent federal challenges.\n   By bringing a procedural challenge under §1983, Skin\n6                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner\nhas never presented his current challenge to Texas’ proce\ndures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allow\ning Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas\nprocedures instead of an attack on state habeas results\nundercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have\nplaced on federal review of state convictions. See Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To\nallege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on\ncollateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas\npetition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions\nand deferential review. But a successful challenge to\nTexas’ collateral review procedures under §1983 would\nimpeach the result of collateral review without complying\nwith any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.\n  The majority contends that its decision will not “spill\nover to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963).” Ante, at 13; but cf. Osborne, supra, at ___–___\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3–5). In truth, the\nmajority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state\nhabeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under §1983: After\nstate habeas is denied, file a §1983 suit challenging the\nstate habeas process rather than the result. What pris\noner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the\napple?3\n\n\n——————\n  3 Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court’s holding will be\n\ncabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss\nwhether a State’s direct review process may be subject to challenge\nunder §1983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct\nand collateral review. This risks transforming §1983 into a vehicle for\ndirect criminal appeals. Cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 486\n(1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort\nto §1983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will\nunsuccessful appellants turn to §1983 to challenge the state appellate\nprocedures.\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011) \n               7\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                              III \n\n   The majority relies on Dotson to reach its conclusion. In\nthat case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in\nstate parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and\n“a new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally\nproper procedures.” 544 U. S., at 77. We found the claims\ncognizable under §1983.\n   Dotson does not control this case. Unlike state collateral\nreview, parole does not evaluate the validity of the under\nlying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review per\nmits prisoners to “attack their final convictions.” Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). In\ncontrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a\nprisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the\nunderlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correct\nness of Dotson, parole procedures do not review the valid\nity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting\nreview of parole procedures does not similarly risk trans\nforming §1983 into a vehicle for “challenging the validity\nof outstanding criminal judgments.” Heck, 512 U. S., at\n486.\n   Contrary to the majority’s contention, Dotson did not\nreduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under\n§1983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner’s claim\nwould “necessarily spell speedier release.” See ante, at 11,\n12, n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).4 As we\nrecognized in Heck, evaluating the boundaries of §1983 is\nnot a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief\nsought was not “speedier release,” we inquired further\nand returned to first principles to determine that the chal\n——————\n  4 Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a con\n\nviction, a “necessarily spell speedier release” test may sufficiently\nsummarize the analysis of §1983 challenges to parole procedures. But\n“necessarily spell speedier release” cannot be the only limit when a\nprisoner challenges procedures used to review the validity of the\nunderlying conviction.\n8                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlenge in that case was not cognizable under §1983.5 See\n512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck\napproach, which I would continue to follow here, was\nincorrect.\n                         *    *    *\n   This Court has struggled to limit §1983 and prevent it\nfrom intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In\ncrafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek\ning “immediate or speedier release” from confinement fall\noutside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another\nlimit when faced with a civil action in which “a judgment\nin favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva\nlidity of his conviction or sentence.” Heck, supra, at 487.\nThis case calls for yet another: due process challenges to\nstate procedures used to review the validity of a conviction\nor sentence. Under that rule, Skinner’s claim is not cogni\nzable under §1983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  5 As respondent argued, our existing formulations are not “the end of\n\nthe test.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/206098/", "sha1": "380d737277bfca13d2755c337eef08fa6fa800df", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-03-07T07:40:06"}
