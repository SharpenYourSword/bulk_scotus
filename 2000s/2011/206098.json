SWITZER, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR\n        31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20139000. Argued October 13, 2010\u2014Decided March 7, 2011\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S.\n  ___, ___, left unresolved the question whether a convicted state pris\n  oner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence may assert that\n  claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 or may assert\n  the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas cor\n  pus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254.\n     A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to\n  death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons. He claimed that a\n  potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to com\n  mit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend\u2019s uncle as the\n  likely perpetrator. In preparation for trial, the State tested some of\n  the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including\n  knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, finger\n  nail clippings, and certain hair samples. More than six years later,\n  Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconvic\n  tion DNA testing in limited circumstances. Invoking Article 64,\n  Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested\n  biological evidence. Both motions were denied. The Texas Court of\n  Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the\n  ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article\n  64.03(a)(2), that he \u201cwould not have been convicted if exculpatory re\n  sults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d The CCA affirmed\n  the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown,\n  as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previ\n  ously tested \u201cthrough no fault\u201d on his part.\n     Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief\n  under \u00a71983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District\n2                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Attorney who has custody of the evidence that Skinner would like to\n    have tested. Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\n    Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA\n    testing he requested. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal\n    of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postcon\n    viction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas cor\n    pus, not under \u00a71983. Adopting that recommendation, the District\n    Court dismissed Skinner\u2019s suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s\n complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under \u00a71983.\n Pp. 7\u201315.\n     (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a\n plausible \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, not an\n exposition of his legal argument. Skinner stated his due process\n claim in a paragraph alleging that the State\u2019s refusal \u201cto release the\n biological evidence for testing . . . deprived [him] of his liberty inter\n ests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction\n and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .\u201d His coun\n sel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s con\n duct or the CCA\u2019s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas\u2019 postconvic\n tion DNA statute \u201cas construed\u201d by the Texas courts. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (b) The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinner\u2019s suit. This\n Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it\n takes its name, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, District of\n Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462. See Exxon\n Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280. Given\n \u201cthe narrow ground\u201d the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has\n confined Rooker-Feldman \u201cto cases . . . brought by state-court losers\n . . . inviting district court review and rejection of [a state court\u2019s]\n judgments.\u201d Ibid. Skinner\u2019s complaint encounters no Rooker-\n Feldman shoal. \u201cIf a federal plaintiff \u2018present[s] [an] independent\n claim,\u2019 \u201d it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction\n that the \u201csame or a related question\u201d was earlier aired between the\n parties in state court. Id., at 292\u2013293. A state-court decision is not\n reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing\n the decision may be challenged in a federal action. See, e.g.,\n Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487. Because Skinner\u2019s federal case\u2014which\n challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute\n they authoritatively construed\u2014falls within the latter category, there\n was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.\n Pp. 8\u201310.\n     (c) Measured against this Court\u2019s prior holdings, Skinner has prop\n erly invoked \u00a71983. This Court has several times considered when a\n state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pur\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nsue a civil rights claim under \u00a71983, and when habeas corpus is the\nprisoner\u2019s sole remedy. The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a \u00a71983\naction for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investi\ngated, arrested, tried, and convicted. This Court held that \u00a71983 was\nnot an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff\u2019s favor\nwould \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. See id., at\n487. In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held\nthat prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative\ndecisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under \u00a71983,\nfor they sought no \u201cinjunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier re\nlease into the community,\u201d id., at 82, and \u201ca favorable judgment\n[would] not \u2018necessarily imply\u2019 the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or\nsentence[s],\u201d ibid. Here, success in Skinner\u2019s suit for DNA testing\nwould not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. Test\nresults might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevita\nble, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.\nSwitzer argues that, although Skinner\u2019s immediate aim is DNA test\ning, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for at\ntacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court\nhas recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought\nwould not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce\nthe custody level. Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in\nthe Circuits that currently allow \u00a71983 claims for DNA testing, there\nhas been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evi\ndence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment. The pro\njected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding\nDNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process\nas a basis for such claims. More generally, in the Prison Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits\nin order to prevent sportive federal-court filings. Nor is there cause\nfor concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady, which announced a consti\ntutional requirement addressed to the prosecution\u2019s conduct pretrial,\nproscribes withholding evidence \u201cfavorable to an accused\u201d and \u201cmate\nrial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\nUnlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or\ninconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evi\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within\nthe traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of\n\u00a71983. Pp. 10\u201314.\n  (d) Switzer\u2019s several arguments why Skinner\u2019s complaint should\nfail for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for\nconsideration on remand.

Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 12\u201313): May a convicted state prisoner\nseeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that\nclaim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, or is\nsuch a claim cognizable in federal court only when as\u00ad\nserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254? The Courts of Appeals have returned\ndiverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d\n89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza\u00ad\nble under \u00a71983); Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 669 (CA7\n2006) (same); Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F. 3d 1287, 1290\u20131291\n(CA11 2002) (same), with Harvey v. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370,\n375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under \u00a71983) and\nKutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339, 341 (CA5\n2002) (per curiam) (same).\n  In Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005), we compre\u00ad\nhensively surveyed this Court\u2019s decisions on the respective\n2                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovinces of \u00a71983 civil rights actions and \u00a72254 federal\nhabeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we\nreaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks \u201cimmediate or\nspeedier release\u201d from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the\nprisoner\u2019s claim would not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier\nrelease,\u201d however, suit may be brought under \u00a71983. Ibid.\nAdhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon\u00ad\nviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a\n\u00a71983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner\nonly access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul\u00ad\npatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a\njudgment that simply orders DNA tests \u201cnecessarily\nimpl[y] the unlawfulness of the State\u2019s custody.\u201d Id., at\n81. We note, however, that the Court\u2019s decision in Os\nborne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner\nmay bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten\u00ad\nsion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to\nshow that the governing state law denies him procedural\ndue process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                             I\n   In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin\u00ad\nner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in\ngirlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was\nbludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons\nwere stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the\nhouse Busby shared with Skinner.\n   Skinner never denied his presence in the house when\nthe killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was\nincapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.\nThe potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at\ntrial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal\nmurders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a\nlikely perpetrator, Busby\u2019s uncle, Robert Donnell (now\ndeceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).\nThe CCA\u2019s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in\ndetail:\n     \u201cAs they approached the house . . . , the police noticed\n     a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the\n     front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear\n     on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.\n     Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila\u2019s\n     dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle\n     stained with blood and hair was leaning against the\n     couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con\u00ad\n     taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains\n     on it was laying between the couch and the coffee\n     table.\n       \u201c[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where\n     [Busby\u2019s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The\n     officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the\n     upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A\n     door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility\n     room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody\n     handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the\n     frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint\n     on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen\n     to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the\n     door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.\n       \u201c[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found\n     him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill\u00ad\n\nings, Busby had spurned Donnell\u2019s \u201crude sexual advances.\u201d Skinner v.\nState, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related\nat a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or\ntwo after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his\npickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5\n2008).\n4                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     and blood-stained blue jeans.\u201d Id., at 536.\nInvestigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from\nBusby.\n   In preparation for trial, \u201cthe State tested the blood on\n[Skinner\u2019s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that\npartially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one\nof the victim\u2019s back and cheeks.\u201d Skinner v. State, 122\nS. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also\ntested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence\u2014\nincluding bloody palm prints in the room where one victim\nwas killed\u2014implicated Skinner, but \u201cfingerprints on a bag\ncontaining one of the knives\u201d did not. Ibid. Items left\nuntested included the knives found on the premises, the\naxe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi\u00ad\ntional hair samples. See ibid.2\n   In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc\u00ad\ncessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.\nSee Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),\ncert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor\u00ad\nmal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence\nthe police had collected at the scene of the crime.3\n   In 2001, more than six years after Skinner\u2019s conviction,\nTexas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to\ngain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 After Skinner\u2019s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer\u00ad\n\ntain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection\nof those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these\nex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint \u00b619, App. 12 (this\n\u201ctesting raised more questions than it answered\u201d). But see Skinner v.\nState, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were\n\u201cinculpatory\u201d).\n  3 Skinner\u2019s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence\n\nremained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,\nSkinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings\ntaken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby\u2019s\nbody, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at\nthe crime scene.

Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.\n2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner\nmust meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show\nthat, at trial, testing either was \u201cnot available\u201d or was\n\u201cavailable, but not technologically capable of providing\nprobative results.\u201d Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he\nmay show that the evidence was not previously tested\n\u201cthrough no fault\u201d on his part, and that \u201cthe interests of\njustice\u201d require a postconviction order for testing. Art.\n64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test\u00ad\ning, a court must make further findings, prime among\nthem, the movant \u201cwould not have been convicted if excul\u00ad\npatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,\u201d\nand \u201cthe [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea\u00ad\nsonably delay the execution of sentence or administration\nof justice.\u201d Art. 64.03(a)(2).\n   Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,\nfirst in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet\nuntested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both\nmotions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner\u2019s\nfirst motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon\u00ad\nstrate a \u201creasonable probability . . . that he would not have\nbeen . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa\u00ad\ntory.\u201d Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.\n   Skinner\u2019s second motion was bolstered by discovery he\nhad obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the\ndenial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground\nthat Skinner failed to meet the \u201cno fault\u201d requirement.\nSee Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an\n\nexpert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two\nsons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby\u2019s right\nhand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint \u00b627, App.\n18.\n  5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner\u2019s second motion, in\u00ad\n\nformed the Texas district court that \u201c[t]o the best of the State\u2019s infor\u00ad\n6                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun\u00ad\nsel testified that he had not \u201cask[ed] for testing because he\nwas afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner\u2019s].\u201d Id.,\nat 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted \u201ca\nreasonable trial strategy\u201d that the court had no cause to\nsecond-guess. Id., at 209.\n   Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc\u00ad\ntive relief under \u00a71983, naming as defendant respondent\nLynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose\u00ad\ncuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner\nwould like to have DNA tested. Skinner\u2019s federal-court\ncomplaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to due process by refusing to provide for\nthe DNA testing he requested. Complaint \u00b633, App. 20\u2013\n21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted. App. 24\u201341. Under the governing Circuit\nprecedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for\nDNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not\nunder \u00a71983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s\nrecommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner\u2019s\nsuit. Id., at 44\u201345.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per\ncuriam), reiterating that \u201can action by a prisoner for post\u00ad\nconviction DNA testing is not cognizable under \u00a71983 and\nmust instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus,\u201d id., at 303. On Skinner\u2019s petition,6 we granted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still\navailable for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in\na condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert\nopinion in that regard.\u201d Record 202. See also Complaint \u00b629, App. 19.\n  6 The State of Texas scheduled Skinner\u2019s execution for March 24,\n\n2010. We granted Skinner\u2019s application to stay his execution until\nfurther action of this Court. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Rhodes, 416 U. S.\n232, 236 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient\nto cross the federal court\u2019s threshold, see Swierkiewicz v.\nSorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint is not a model of the careful drafter\u2019s art, but under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not\npin plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.\nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener\u00ad\nally requires only a plausible \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement\nof the plaintiff\u2019s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu\u00ad\nment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &\nProcedure \u00a71219, pp. 277\u2013278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.\n2010).\n  Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph\nalleging that the State\u2019s refusal \u201cto release the biological\nevidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty\ninterests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of\nhis conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his\nsentence . . . .\u201d Complaint \u00b633, App. 20\u201321. As earlier\nrecounted, see supra, at 5\u20136, Skinner had twice requested\nand failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law\nprocedure then available to him. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b622\u201331,\nApp. 14\u201320.7 At oral argument in this Court, Skinner\u2019s\ncounsel clarified the gist of Skinner\u2019s due process claim:\nHe does not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s conduct or the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 He also persistently sought the State\u2019s voluntary testing of the ma\u00ad\n\nterials he identified. See Complaint \u00b631, App. 20.\n8                         SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndecisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his\nmotions; instead, he challenges, as denying him proce\u00ad\ndural due process, Texas\u2019 postconviction DNA statute \u201cas\nconstrued\u201d by the Texas courts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See\nalso id., at 52 (Texas courts, Skinner\u2019s counsel argued,\nhave \u201cconstrued the statute to completely foreclose any\nprisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to\ntrial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing\u201d postconviction).8\n   The merits of Skinner\u2019s federal-court complaint assail\u00ad\ning the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and\nparticularly the vitality of his claim in light of Osborne,\nsee supra, at 2\u2014unaddressed by the District Court or the\nFifth Circuit\u2014are not ripe for review. We take up here\nonly the questions whether there is federal-court subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s complaint, and whether\nthe claim he presses is cognizable under \u00a71983.\n                               B\n   Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner\u2019s challenge is\n\u201c[j]urisdictionally [b]arred\u201d by what has come to be known\nas the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48\u2013\n49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we\nconclude that Rooker-Feldman does not bar Skinner\u2019s suit.\n   As we explained in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005), the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only\ntwice, i.e., only in the two cases from which the doctrine\ntakes its name: first, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\nU. S. 413 (1923), then 60 years later, District of Columbia\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Unlike the petitioner in District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial\n\nDist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), who \u201cattempt[ed] to sidestep\nstate process through . . . a federal lawsuit,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),\nSkinner first resorted to state court, see supra, at 5\u20136. In this respect,\nSkinner is better positioned to urge in federal court \u201cthe inadequacy of\nthe state-law procedures available to him in state postconviction relief.\u201d\nOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both\ncases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed\nsuit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings\nended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court\njudgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of\nthat judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the\nplaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court\nto overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,\nin both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257\n\u201cvests authority to review a state court\u2019s judgment solely\nin this Court.\u201d See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.\n   We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\nhad been construed by some federal courts \u201cto extend far\nbeyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.\u201d\nId., at 283. Emphasizing \u201cthe narrow ground\u201d occupied by\nthe doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that Rooker-\nFeldman \u201cis confined to cases of the kind from which the\ndoctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court\nlosers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of\n[the state court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d Ibid.\n   Skinner\u2019s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no\nRooker-Feldman shoal. \u201cIf a federal plaintiff \u2018present[s]\n[an] independent claim,\u2019 \u201d it is not an impediment to the\nexercise of federal jurisdiction that the \u201csame or a related\nquestion\u201d was earlier aired between the parties in state\ncourt. id., at 292\u2013293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,\n995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);\nsee In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law pro\u00ad\ncedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The judgment assailed in Feldman was rendered by the District of\n\nColumbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state\u2019s\nhighest court.\n10                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201climited grasp\u201d of Rooker-Feldman).\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 7\u20138, Skinner does not\nchallenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,\nhe targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they\nauthoritatively construed. As the Court explained in\nFeldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544\nU. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by\nlower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the\ndecision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner\u2019s\nfederal case falls within the latter category. There was,\ntherefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin\u00ad\nner\u2019s federal suit.11\n                             C\n   When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu\u00ad\ntional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under\n\u00a71983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner\u2019s sole\nremedy? This Court has several times considered that\nquestion. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512\nU. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state\nprisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a\n\u00a71983 action for damages, alleging that he had been\nunlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.\nAlthough the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages\nonly, not release from confinement, we ruled that the\nplaintiff could not proceed under \u00a71983. Any award in his\nfavor, we observed, would \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalid\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292\u2013293 (2005), that \u201c[w]hen there is\nparallel state and federal litigation,\u201d state preclusion law may become\ndecisive, but \u201c[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.\u201d\n  11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in\n\nthe Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,\n\u201cRooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,\u201d Lance v.\nDennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu\u00ad\nsion unresolved below are \u201cbest left for full airing and decision on\nremand,\u201d id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When \u201ca judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,\u201d the Court held, \u00a71983 is not\nan available remedy. Ibid. \u201cBut if . . . the plaintiff\u2019s ac\u00ad\ntion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity\nof [his conviction or sentence], the [\u00a71983] action should be\nallowed to proceed . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n   We summarized the relevant case law most recently in\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in\u00ad\nvolved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of\nadministrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.\nThey could proceed under \u00a71983, the Court held, for they\nsought no \u201cinjunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier\nrelease into the community,\u201d id., at 82, and \u201ca favorable\njudgment [would] not \u2018necessarily imply the invalidity of\n[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting Heck,\n512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).\n   Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop\u00ad\nerly invoked \u00a71983. Success in his suit for DNA testing\nwould not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his convic\u00ad\ntion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that\noutcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might\nfurther incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU. S. 637, 647 (2004) (\u201c[W]e were careful in Heck to stress\nthe importance of the term \u2018necessarily.\u2019 \u201d).12\n   Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with\nFifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,\nthat Skinner\u2019s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if\nat all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a \u00a71983\naction. The dissent echoes Switzer\u2019s argument. See post,\nat 3. Although Skinner\u2019s immediate plea is simply for an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and\n\ninstead would instruct district courts to resort to \u201cfirst principles\u201d each\ntime a state prisoner files a \u00a71983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.\n12                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\norder requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer\nurges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking\nhis conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has\nfound no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has\nrecognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available\none, where the relief sought would \u201cneither terminat[e]\ncustody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus\u00ad\ntody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.\u201d Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Respondent Switzer and her amici forecast that a \u201cvast\nexpansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue\u201d were we\nto hold that Skinner\u2019s complaint can be initiated under\n\u00a71983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa\u00ad\ntion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a\nproliferation of federal civil actions \u201cseeking postconviction\ndiscovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ\u00ad\nated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.\u201d\nId., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are\nunwarranted.13\n   In the Circuits that currently allow \u00a71983 claims for\nDNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by\nSwitzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n\n544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner\u2019s require inquiry\ninto the State\u2019s proof at trial and therefore lie at \u201cthe core of the crimi\u00ad\nnal proceeding itself.\u201d Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33\u201334. Dotson de\u00ad\nclared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner\u2019s claim\nwould not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release,\u201d that claim does not lie at\n\u201cthe core of habeas corpus,\u201d and may be brought, if at all, under \u00a71983.\n544 U. S., at 82 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee id., at 85\u201386 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Whatever might be said of\nSwitzer\u2019s argument were we to recast our doctrine, Switzer\u2019s position\ncannot be reconciled with the line our precedent currently draws. Nor\ncan the dissent\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cretur[n] to first principles.\u201d Post, at 7.\nGiven the importance of providing clear guidance to the lower courts,\n\u201cwe again see no reason for moving the line our cases draw.\u201d Dotson,\n544 U.

S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprojected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible\nregarding DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected\nsubstantive due process as a basis for such claims. See\nsupra, at 2.\n   More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321\u201366, Congress has placed a\nseries of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to\nprevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA\n\u00a7803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e to create new proce\u00ad\ndures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under \u00a71983);\nPLRA \u00a7804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S.

C. \u00a71915(f) to require\nprisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed\nagainst them out of their prison trust account); PLRA\n\u00a7804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(g) to revoke, with lim\u00ad\nited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris\u00ad\noner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state\na claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596\u2013597 (1998) (PLRA aims to\n\u201cdiscourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely\nto succeed,\u201d and statistics suggest that the Act is \u201chaving\nits intended effect\u201d).\n   Nor do we see any cause for concern that today\u2019s ruling\nwill spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373\nU. S. 83 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion.\nBrady announced a constitutional requirement addressed\nfirst and foremost to the prosecution\u2019s conduct pretrial.\nBrady proscribes withholding evidence \u201cfavorable to an\naccused\u201d and \u201cmaterial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\u201d\nCone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). To\nestablish that a Brady violation undermines a conviction,\na convicted defendant must make each of three showings:\n(1) the evidence at issue is \u201cfavorable to the accused,\neither because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeach\u00ad\n14                  SKINNER v.

S. 668, 691 (2004).\n   Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,\nincriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,\nwhen successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi\u00ad\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by\ndefinition, always favorable to the defendant and material\nto his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at\n296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic\u00ad\ntion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for\n\u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from imprisonment. See\nDotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have\nranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and\noutside the province of \u00a71983. See Heck, 512 U.

I\ndisagree.1 I accept the majority\u2019s characterization of the\nissue here as the question left open in District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), ante, at 1, where a prisoner challenged the consti\ntutional adequacy of the access to DNA evidence provided\nby Alaska\u2019s \u201cgeneral postconviction relief statute,\u201d 557\nU.

Like Osborne, Skinner seeks\nto challenge state collateral review procedures.2 I would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 I adopt the majority\u2019s view that Skinner has alleged a violation of\n\nprocedural due process despite the fact that his complaint is more\nnaturally read as alleging a violation of substantive due process. I also\nignore the questionable premise that the requested relief\u2014DNA test\ning\u2014would be available in a procedural due process challenge. Com\npare Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.

Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (\u00a71983 should not \u201cexpand\nopportunities for collateral attack\u201d). But this Court has\nnever purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of\n\u00a71983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each\nclaim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi\nples and our prior decisions.\n  In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis\nputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use \u00a71983\nto \u201cchalleng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on\nfederal constitutional grounds.\u201d 411 U. S., at 489. This\nincluded attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486\n(\u201cden[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial\u201d). From there,\nthe Court reasoned that \u201cimmediate release from [physi\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npostconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a\nstate habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See\nArd v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does\nnot itself \u201cprovide a vehicle for obtaining relief,\u201d Ex parte Tuley, 109\nS. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and\nby nature part of Texas\u2019 collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 8 (\u201cBecause [Article 64] does not give the convicting court\nauthority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a\nhabeas proceeding to challenge the conviction\u201d).\n  Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner\u2019s due process chal\nlenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a\nmotion under Article 64 is an \u201capplication for . . . collateral review\u201d\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2). See Wall v. Kholi, post, at 10, n. 4\n(noting that an application for review must \u201cprovide a state court with\nauthority to order relief from a judgment\u201d). Texas has divided postcon\nviction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for state habeas\ninto separate proceedings, but both remain parts of the State\u2019s collat\neral review process.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Id., at 489; see also Wolff\nv. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974) (refusing to allow a\n\u00a71983 suit for restoration of good-time credits); Edwards v.\nBalisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997) (refusing to allow a \u00a71983\nprocedural challenge to the process used to revoke good\ntime credits). Then, in Heck v. Humphrey, we addressed\n\u00a71983 actions seeking damages. 512 U. S., at 483. De\ntermining that such actions were not covered by Preiser,\nwe returned to \u201cthe hoary principle that civil tort actions\nare not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments,\u201d 512 U. S., at 486, and\nconcluded that a complaint must be dismissed where \u201ca\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d id., at 487.\nMost recently, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 82\n(2005), we applied the principles from these prior decisions\nand found cognizable under \u00a71983 a claim that sought to\n\u201crender invalid the state procedures used to deny parole\neligibility . . . and parole suitability.\u201d\n                             II\n   We have not previously addressed whether due process\nchallenges to state collateral review procedures may be\nbrought under \u00a71983, and I would hold that they may not.\nChallenges to all state procedures for reviewing the valid\nity of a conviction should be treated the same as chal\nlenges to state trial procedures, which we have already\nrecognized may not be brought under \u00a71983. Moreover,\nallowing such challenges under \u00a71983 would undermine\nCongress\u2019 strict limitations on federal review of state\nhabeas decisions. If cognizable at all, Skinner\u2019s claim\nsounds in habeas corpus.\n   First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the\nprocess of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all\nprocedures\u2014including collateral review procedures\u2014that\n4                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nestablish and review the validity of a conviction. This has\nlong been recognized for direct appellate review:\n    \u201cAnd while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re\n    quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re\n    view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that\n    where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner\n    has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel\n    late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process\n    of law under which he is held in custody by the State,\n    and to be considered in determining any question of\n    alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the\n    Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Frank v. Mangum, 237\n    U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).\nSimilarly, although a State is not required to provide\nprocedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that\nwhen state collateral review procedures are provided for,\nthey too are part of the \u201cprocess of law under which [a\nprisoner] is held in custody by the State.\u201d Ibid. As this\nCourt has explained, when considering whether the State\nhas provided all the process that is due in depriving an\nindividual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both\npre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of\nEd. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (\u201c[T]he\nexistence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the\nnecessary scope of pretermination procedures\u201d); see also\nNational Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm\u2019n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason\nthis Court should refuse to allow \u00a71983 suits to challenge\npart of this process\u2014the trial proceedings\u2014but bless the\nuse of \u00a71983 to challenge other parts.\n  Collateral review procedures are, of course, \u201cnot part of\nthe criminal proceeding itself.\u201d Pennsylvania v. Finley,\n481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel\nlate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTrial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner;\nappellate procedures review the validity of that conviction\nbefore it becomes final; and collateral review procedures\npermit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For\npurposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds\nof \u00a71983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all\nconstitutional challenges to procedures concerning the\nvalidity of a conviction. See Heck, supra, at 491 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between\nhabeas and \u00a71983], provided that it does so in a principled\nfashion\u201d).\n   Second, \u201cprinciples of federalism and comity [are] at\nstake\u201d when federal courts review state collateral review\nprocedures, just as when they review state trial proce\ndures. Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2). An attack in federal court on any \u201cstate\njudicial action\u201d concerning a state conviction must proceed\nwith \u201cproper respect for state functions,\u201d because the\nfederal courts are being asked to \u201ctr[y] the regularity of\nproceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d\nPreiser, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted).\n   Because of these concerns for federal-state comity,\nCongress has strictly limited the procedures for federal\nhabeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas\ndecisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner\nmay seek relief in federal court, he must \u201cexhaus[t] the\nremedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive\nsignificant deference in subsequent federal habeas pro\nceedings. \u00a72254(d). These requirements ensure that the\nstate courts have the first opportunity to correct any error\nwith a state conviction and that their rulings receive due\nrespect in subsequent federal challenges.\n   By bringing a procedural challenge under \u00a71983, Skin\n6                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner\nhas never presented his current challenge to Texas\u2019 proce\ndures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allow\ning Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas\nprocedures instead of an attack on state habeas results\nundercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have\nplaced on federal review of state convictions. See Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To\nallege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on\ncollateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas\npetition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions\nand deferential review. But a successful challenge to\nTexas\u2019 collateral review procedures under \u00a71983 would\nimpeach the result of collateral review without complying\nwith any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.\n  The majority contends that its decision will not \u201cspill\nover to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963).\u201d Ante, at 13; but cf. Osborne, supra, at ___\u2013___\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\u20135). In truth, the\nmajority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state\nhabeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under \u00a71983: After\nstate habeas is denied, file a \u00a71983 suit challenging the\nstate habeas process rather than the result. What pris\noner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the\napple?3\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court\u2019s holding will be\n\ncabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss\nwhether a State\u2019s direct review process may be subject to challenge\nunder \u00a71983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct\nand collateral review. This risks transforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for\ndirect criminal appeals. Cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 486\n(1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort\nto \u00a71983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will\nunsuccessful appellants turn to \u00a71983 to challenge the state appellate\nprocedures.\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

In\nthat case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in\nstate parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and\n\u201ca new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally\nproper procedures.\u201d 544 U. S., at 77. We found the claims\ncognizable under \u00a71983.\n   Dotson does not control this case. Unlike state collateral\nreview, parole does not evaluate the validity of the under\nlying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review per\nmits prisoners to \u201cattack their final convictions.\u201d Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). In\ncontrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a\nprisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the\nunderlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correct\nness of Dotson, parole procedures do not review the valid\nity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting\nreview of parole procedures does not similarly risk trans\nforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for \u201cchallenging the validity\nof outstanding criminal judgments.\u201d Heck, 512 U. S., at\n486.\n   Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, Dotson did not\nreduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under\n\u00a71983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner\u2019s claim\nwould \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release.\u201d See ante, at 11,\n12, n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).4 As we\nrecognized in Heck, evaluating the boundaries of \u00a71983 is\nnot a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief\nsought was not \u201cspeedier release,\u201d we inquired further\nand returned to first principles to determine that the chal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a con\n\nviction, a \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release\u201d test may sufficiently\nsummarize the analysis of \u00a71983 challenges to parole procedures. But\n\u201cnecessarily spell speedier release\u201d cannot be the only limit when a\nprisoner challenges procedures used to review the validity of the\nunderlying conviction.\n8                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlenge in that case was not cognizable under \u00a71983.5 See\n512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck\napproach, which I would continue to follow here, was\nincorrect.\n                         *    *    *\n   This Court has struggled to limit \u00a71983 and prevent it\nfrom intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In\ncrafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek\ning \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from confinement fall\noutside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another\nlimit when faced with a civil action in which \u201ca judgment\nin favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva\nlidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d Heck, supra, at 487.\nThis case calls for yet another: due process challenges to\nstate procedures used to review the validity of a conviction\nor sentence. Under that rule, Skinner\u2019s claim is not cogni\nzable under \u00a71983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals should be affirmed.

S.\n  ___, ___, left unresolved the question whether a convicted state pris\n  oner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence may assert that\n  claim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 or may assert\n  the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas cor\n  pus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254.\n     A Texas jury convicted petitioner Skinner and sentenced him to\n  death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons. He claimed that a\n  potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to com\n  mit the brutal murders, and he identified his girlfriend\u2019s uncle as the\n  likely perpetrator. In preparation for trial, the State tested some of\n  the physical evidence, but left untested several items, including\n  knives found on the premises, an axe handle, vaginal swabs, finger\n  nail clippings, and certain hair samples. More than six years later,\n  Texas enacted Article 64, which allows prisoners to gain postconvic\n  tion DNA testing in limited circumstances. Invoking Article 64,\n  Skinner twice moved in state court for DNA testing of the untested\n  biological evidence. Both motions were denied. The Texas Court of\n  Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed the first denial of relief on the\n  ground that Skinner had not shown, as required by Article\n  64.03(a)(2), that he \u201cwould not have been convicted if exculpatory re\n  sults had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d The CCA affirmed\n  the second denial of relief on the ground that Skinner had not shown,\n  as required by Article 64.01(b)(1)(B), that the evidence was not previ\n  ously tested \u201cthrough no fault\u201d on his part.\n     Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief\n  under \u00a71983, naming as defendant respondent Switzer, the District\n2                        SKINNER v.

Skinner alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\n    Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA\n    testing he requested. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal\n    of the complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that postcon\n    viction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas cor\n    pus, not under \u00a71983. Adopting that recommendation, the District\n    Court dismissed Skinner\u2019s suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: There is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s\n complaint, and the claim he presses is cognizable under \u00a71983.\n Pp. 7\u201315.\n     (a) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) generally requires only a\n plausible \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, not an\n exposition of his legal argument. Skinner stated his due process\n claim in a paragraph alleging that the State\u2019s refusal \u201cto release the\n biological evidence for testing . . . deprived [him] of his liberty inter\n ests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction\n and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .\u201d His coun\n sel has clarified that Skinner does not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s con\n duct or the CCA\u2019s decisions; instead, he challenges Texas\u2019 postconvic\n tion DNA statute \u201cas construed\u201d by the Texas courts.

Skinner\u2019s complaint encounters no Rooker-\n Feldman shoal. \u201cIf a federal plaintiff \u2018present[s] [an] independent\n claim,\u2019 \u201d it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction\n that the \u201csame or a related question\u201d was earlier aired between the\n parties in state court. Id., at 292\u2013293. A state-court decision is not\n reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing\n the decision may be challenged in a federal action. See, e.g.,\n Feldman, 460 U. S., at 487. Because Skinner\u2019s federal case\u2014which\n challenges not the adverse state-court decisions but the Texas statute\n they authoritatively construed\u2014falls within the latter category, there\n was no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over his federal suit.\n Pp. 8\u201310.\n     (c) Measured against this Court\u2019s prior holdings, Skinner has prop\n erly invoked \u00a71983. This Court has several times considered when a\n state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pur\n                    Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nsue a civil rights claim under \u00a71983, and when habeas corpus is the\nprisoner\u2019s sole remedy. The pathmarking decision, Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, concerned a state prisoner who brought a \u00a71983\naction for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investi\ngated, arrested, tried, and convicted. This Court held that \u00a71983 was\nnot an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff\u2019s favor\nwould \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. See id., at\n487. In contrast, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, the Court held\nthat prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative\ndecisions denying them parole eligibility, could proceed under \u00a71983,\nfor they sought no \u201cinjunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier re\nlease into the community,\u201d id., at 82, and \u201ca favorable judgment\n[would] not \u2018necessarily imply\u2019 the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or\nsentence[s],\u201d ibid. Here, success in Skinner\u2019s suit for DNA testing\nwould not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. Test\nresults might prove exculpatory, but that outcome is hardly inevita\nble, for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.\nSwitzer argues that, although Skinner\u2019s immediate aim is DNA test\ning, his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for at\ntacking his conviction. But she has found no case in which the Court\nhas recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought\nwould not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, or reduce\nthe custody level. Contrary to the fears of Switzer and her amici, in\nthe Circuits that currently allow \u00a71983 claims for DNA testing, there\nhas been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evi\ndence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment. The pro\njected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding\nDNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected substantive due process\nas a basis for such claims. More generally, in the Prison Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, Congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits\nin order to prevent sportive federal-court filings. Nor is there cause\nfor concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady, which announced a consti\ntutional requirement addressed to the prosecution\u2019s conduct pretrial,\nproscribes withholding evidence \u201cfavorable to an accused\u201d and \u201cmate\nrial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___.\nUnlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or\ninconclusive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evi\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within\nthe traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of\n\u00a71983. Pp. 10\u201314.\n  (d) Switzer\u2019s several arguments why Skinner\u2019s complaint should\nfail for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for\nconsideration on remand.

Osborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 12\u201313): May a convicted state prisoner\nseeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that\nclaim in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, or is\nsuch a claim cognizable in federal court only when as\u00ad\nserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254? The Courts of Appeals have returned\ndiverse responses. Compare McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d\n89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cogniza\u00ad\nble under \u00a71983); Savory v.

Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005), we compre\u00ad\nhensively surveyed this Court\u2019s decisions on the respective\n2                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovinces of \u00a71983 civil rights actions and \u00a72254 federal\nhabeas petitions. Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we\nreaffirmed, for the prisoner who seeks \u201cimmediate or\nspeedier release\u201d from confinement. Id., at 82. Where the\nprisoner\u2019s claim would not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier\nrelease,\u201d however, suit may be brought under \u00a71983. Ibid.\nAdhering to our opinion in Dotson, we hold that a postcon\u00ad\nviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a\n\u00a71983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner\nonly access to the DNA evidence, which may prove excul\u00ad\npatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a\njudgment that simply orders DNA tests \u201cnecessarily\nimpl[y] the unlawfulness of the State\u2019s custody.\u201d Id., at\n81. We note, however, that the Court\u2019s decision in Os\nborne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner\nmay bring for DNA testing. Osborne rejected the exten\u00ad\nsion of substantive due process to this area, 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19), and left slim room for the prisoner to\nshow that the governing state law denies him procedural\ndue process, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                             I\n   In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skin\u00ad\nner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in\ngirlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was\nbludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons\nwere stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the\nhouse Busby shared with Skinner.\n   Skinner never denied his presence in the house when\nthe killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was\nincapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.\nThe potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at\ntrial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal\nmurders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a\nlikely perpetrator, Busby\u2019s uncle, Robert Donnell (now\ndeceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

Skinner v. State, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 546 (1997).\nThe CCA\u2019s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in\ndetail:\n     \u201cAs they approached the house . . . , the police noticed\n     a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the\n     front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear\n     on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.\n     Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila\u2019s\n     dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle\n     stained with blood and hair was leaning against the\n     couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag con\u00ad\n     taining a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains\n     on it was laying between the couch and the coffee\n     table.\n       \u201c[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where\n     [Busby\u2019s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The\n     officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the\n     upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. . . . A\n     door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility\n     room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody\n     handprint located about 24 inches off the floor on the\n     frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint\n     on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen\n     to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the\n     door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.\n       \u201c[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found\n     him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the kill\u00ad\n\nings, Busby had spurned Donnell\u2019s \u201crude sexual advances.\u201d Skinner v.\nState, 956 S. W. 2d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). A neighbor related\nat a federal postconviction hearing that she observed Donnell, a day or\ntwo after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his\npickup truck. See Skinner v. Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5\n2008).\n4                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     and blood-stained blue jeans.\u201d Id., at 536.\nInvestigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from\nBusby.\n   In preparation for trial, \u201cthe State tested the blood on\n[Skinner\u2019s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that\npartially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one\nof the victim\u2019s back and cheeks.\u201d Skinner v. State, 122\nS. W. 3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also\ntested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence\u2014\nincluding bloody palm prints in the room where one victim\nwas killed\u2014implicated Skinner, but \u201cfingerprints on a bag\ncontaining one of the knives\u201d did not. Ibid. Items left\nuntested included the knives found on the premises, the\naxe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and addi\u00ad\ntional hair samples. See ibid.2\n   In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuc\u00ad\ncessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.\nSee Skinner v. Quarterman, 576 F. 3d 214 (CA5 2009),\ncert. denied, 559 U. S. ___ (2010). He also pursued infor\u00ad\nmal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence\nthe police had collected at the scene of the crime.3\n   In 2001, more than six years after Skinner\u2019s conviction,\nTexas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to\ngain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 After Skinner\u2019s conviction, the State performed DNA tests on cer\u00ad\n\ntain additional materials, but Skinner took no part in the selection\nof those materials or their testing. Skinner maintains that these\nex parte tests were inconclusive. See Complaint \u00b619, App. 12 (this\n\u201ctesting raised more questions than it answered\u201d). But see Skinner v.\nState, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were\n\u201cinculpatory\u201d).\n  3 Skinner\u2019s trial counsel, although aware that biological evidence\n\nremained untested, did not request further testing. Postconviction,\nSkinner sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and finger nail clippings\ntaken from Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby\u2019s\nbody, and biological material on knives and a dish towel recovered at\nthe crime scene.

Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp.\n2010). To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner\nmust meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show\nthat, at trial, testing either was \u201cnot available\u201d or was\n\u201cavailable, but not technologically capable of providing\nprobative results.\u201d Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he\nmay show that the evidence was not previously tested\n\u201cthrough no fault\u201d on his part, and that \u201cthe interests of\njustice\u201d require a postconviction order for testing. Art.\n64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction test\u00ad\ning, a court must make further findings, prime among\nthem, the movant \u201cwould not have been convicted if excul\u00ad\npatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,\u201d\nand \u201cthe [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unrea\u00ad\nsonably delay the execution of sentence or administration\nof justice.\u201d Art. 64.03(a)(2).\n   Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court,\nfirst in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet\nuntested biological evidence. See supra, at 4, n. 3. Both\nmotions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner\u2019s\nfirst motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demon\u00ad\nstrate a \u201creasonable probability . . . that he would not have\nbeen . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpa\u00ad\ntory.\u201d Skinner v. State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813.\n   Skinner\u2019s second motion was bolstered by discovery he\nhad obtained in the interim.4 The CCA again affirmed the\ndenial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground\nthat Skinner failed to meet the \u201cno fault\u201d requirement.\nSee Skinner v. State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).5 Dur\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 On the basis of discovery in a federal postconviction proceeding, an\n\nexpert retained by Skinner concluded that Skinner, Busby, and her two\nsons could be excluded as sources of a hair collected from Busby\u2019s right\nhand after the killings. See Record 190. See also Complaint \u00b627, App.\n18.\n  5 The District Attorney, in response to Skinner\u2019s second motion, in\u00ad\n\nformed the Texas district court that \u201c[t]o the best of the State\u2019s infor\u00ad\n6                        SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial coun\u00ad\nsel testified that he had not \u201cask[ed] for testing because he\nwas afraid the DNA would turn out to be [Skinner\u2019s].\u201d Id.,\nat 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted \u201ca\nreasonable trial strategy\u201d that the court had no cause to\nsecond-guess. Id., at 209.\n   Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunc\u00ad\ntive relief under \u00a71983, naming as defendant respondent\nLynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prose\u00ad\ncuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner\nwould like to have DNA tested. Skinner\u2019s federal-court\ncomplaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to due process by refusing to provide for\nthe DNA testing he requested. Complaint \u00b633, App. 20\u2013\n21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted. App. 24\u201341. Under the governing Circuit\nprecedent, Kutzner v. Montgomery County, 303 F. 3d 339,\nthe Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for\nDNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not\nunder \u00a71983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s\nrecommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner\u2019s\nsuit. Id., at 44\u201345.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) (per\ncuriam), reiterating that \u201can action by a prisoner for post\u00ad\nconviction DNA testing is not cognizable under \u00a71983 and\nmust instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus,\u201d id., at 303. On Skinner\u2019s petition,6 we granted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmation, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still\navailable for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in\na condition to be tested although the State has not sought expert\nopinion in that regard.\u201d Record 202. See also Complaint \u00b629, App. 19.\n  6 The State of Texas scheduled Skinner\u2019s execution for March 24,\n\n2010.

Rhodes, 416 U. S.\n232, 236 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient\nto cross the federal court\u2019s threshold, see Swierkiewicz v.\nSorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 514 (2002). Skinner\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint is not a model of the careful drafter\u2019s art, but under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not\npin plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief to a precise legal theory.\nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gener\u00ad\nally requires only a plausible \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement\nof the plaintiff\u2019s claim, not an exposition of his legal argu\u00ad\nment. See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &\nProcedure \u00a71219, pp. 277\u2013278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp.\n2010).\n  Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph\nalleging that the State\u2019s refusal \u201cto release the biological\nevidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty\ninterests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of\nhis conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his\nsentence . . . .\u201d Complaint \u00b633, App. 20\u201321. As earlier\nrecounted, see supra, at 5\u20136, Skinner had twice requested\nand failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law\nprocedure then available to him.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See\nalso id., at 52 (Texas courts, Skinner\u2019s counsel argued,\nhave \u201cconstrued the statute to completely foreclose any\nprisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to\ntrial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing\u201d postconviction).8\n   The merits of Skinner\u2019s federal-court complaint assail\u00ad\ning the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and\nparticularly the vitality of his claim in light of Osborne,\nsee supra, at 2\u2014unaddressed by the District Court or the\nFifth Circuit\u2014are not ripe for review. We take up here\nonly the questions whether there is federal-court subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s complaint, and whether\nthe claim he presses is cognizable under \u00a71983.\n                               B\n   Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner\u2019s challenge is\n\u201c[j]urisdictionally [b]arred\u201d by what has come to be known\nas the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48\u2013\n49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we\nconclude that Rooker-Feldman does not bar Skinner\u2019s suit.\n   As we explained in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005), the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only\ntwice, i.e., only in the two cases from which the doctrine\ntakes its name: first, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\nU. S. 413 (1923), then 60 years later, District of Columbia\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Unlike the petitioner in District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial\n\nDist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), who \u201cattempt[ed] to sidestep\nstate process through . . . a federal lawsuit,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),\nSkinner first resorted to state court, see supra, at 5\u20136. In this respect,\nSkinner is better positioned to urge in federal court \u201cthe inadequacy of\nthe state-law procedures available to him in state postconviction relief.\u201d\nOsborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462 (1983). Both\ncases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court9 filed\nsuit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings\nended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court\njudgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of\nthat judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the\nplaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman asked the District Court\nto overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held,\nin both cases, that the District Courts lacked subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction over such claims, for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257\n\u201cvests authority to review a state court\u2019s judgment solely\nin this Court.\u201d See Exxon, 544 U. S., at 292.\n   We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\nhad been construed by some federal courts \u201cto extend far\nbeyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases.\u201d\nId., at 283. Emphasizing \u201cthe narrow ground\u201d occupied by\nthe doctrine, id., at 284, we clarified in Exxon that Rooker-\nFeldman \u201cis confined to cases of the kind from which the\ndoctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court\nlosers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of\n[the state court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d Ibid.\n   Skinner\u2019s litigation, in light of Exxon, encounters no\nRooker-Feldman shoal. \u201cIf a federal plaintiff \u2018present[s]\n[an] independent claim,\u2019 \u201d it is not an impediment to the\nexercise of federal jurisdiction that the \u201csame or a related\nquestion\u201d was earlier aired between the parties in state\ncourt. id., at 292\u2013293 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Rosemont,\n995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original);\nsee In re Smith, 349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law pro\u00ad\ncedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The judgment assailed in Feldman was rendered by the District of\n\nColumbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a state\u2019s\nhighest court.\n10                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201climited grasp\u201d of Rooker-Feldman).\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 7\u20138, Skinner does not\nchallenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead,\nhe targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they\nauthoritatively construed. As the Court explained in\nFeldman, 460 U. S., at 487, and reiterated in Exxon, 544\nU. S., at 286, a state-court decision is not reviewable by\nlower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the\ndecision may be challenged in a federal action.10 Skinner\u2019s\nfederal case falls within the latter category. There was,\ntherefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skin\u00ad\nner\u2019s federal suit.11\n                             C\n   When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitu\u00ad\ntional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under\n\u00a71983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner\u2019s sole\nremedy? This Court has several times considered that\nquestion. Pathmarking here is Heck v. Humphrey, 512\nU. S. 477 (1994). Plaintiff in that litigation was a state\nprisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a\n\u00a71983 action for damages, alleging that he had been\nunlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted.\nAlthough the complaint in Heck sought monetary damages\nonly, not release from confinement, we ruled that the\nplaintiff could not proceed under \u00a71983. Any award in his\nfavor, we observed, would \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalid\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court further observed in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292\u2013293 (2005), that \u201c[w]hen there is\nparallel state and federal litigation,\u201d state preclusion law may become\ndecisive, but \u201c[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.\u201d\n  11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in\n\nthe Article 64 proceeding. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Even if that were so,\n\u201cRooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name,\u201d Lance v.\nDennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclu\u00ad\nsion unresolved below are \u201cbest left for full airing and decision on\nremand,\u201d id., at 467 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity of his conviction. See id., at 487. When \u201ca judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,\u201d the Court held, \u00a71983 is not\nan available remedy. Ibid. \u201cBut if . . . the plaintiff\u2019s ac\u00ad\ntion, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity\nof [his conviction or sentence], the [\u00a71983] action should be\nallowed to proceed . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n   We summarized the relevant case law most recently in\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). That case in\u00ad\nvolved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of\nadministrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.\nThey could proceed under \u00a71983, the Court held, for they\nsought no \u201cinjunction ordering . . . immediate or speedier\nrelease into the community,\u201d id., at 82, and \u201ca favorable\njudgment [would] not \u2018necessarily imply the invalidity of\n[their] conviction[s] or sentence[s],\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting Heck,\n512 U. S., at 487; first alteration added).\n   Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has prop\u00ad\nerly invoked \u00a71983. Success in his suit for DNA testing\nwould not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his convic\u00ad\ntion. While test results might prove exculpatory, that\noutcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 2, results might prove inconclusive or they might\nfurther incriminate Skinner. See Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU. S. 637, 647 (2004) (\u201c[W]e were careful in Heck to stress\nthe importance of the term \u2018necessarily.\u2019 \u201d).12\n   Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with\nFifth Circuit precedent, see Kutzner, 303 F. 3d, at 341,\nthat Skinner\u2019s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if\nat all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a \u00a71983\naction. The dissent echoes Switzer\u2019s argument. See post,\nat 3. Although Skinner\u2019s immediate plea is simply for an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent would muddle the clear line Heck and Dotson drew, and\n\ninstead would instruct district courts to resort to \u201cfirst principles\u201d each\ntime a state prisoner files a \u00a71983 claim in federal court. Post, at 2, 7.\n12                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\norder requiring DNA testing, his ultimate aim, Switzer\nurges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking\nhis conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has\nfound no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has\nrecognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available\none, where the relief sought would \u201cneither terminat[e]\ncustody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from cus\u00ad\ntody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.\u201d Dotson, 544 U. S.,\nat 86 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Respondent Switzer and her amici forecast that a \u201cvast\nexpansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue\u201d were we\nto hold that Skinner\u2019s complaint can be initiated under\n\u00a71983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Associa\u00ad\ntion as Amicus Curiae 8. In particular, they predict a\nproliferation of federal civil actions \u201cseeking postconviction\ndiscovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associ\u00ad\nated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.\u201d\nId., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, post, at 6, are\nunwarranted.13\n   In the Circuits that currently allow \u00a71983 claims for\nDNA testing, see supra, at 1, no evidence tendered by\nSwitzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v. Dotson,\n\n544 U. S. 74 (2005), Switzer urges, claims like Skinner\u2019s require inquiry\ninto the State\u2019s proof at trial and therefore lie at \u201cthe core of the crimi\u00ad\nnal proceeding itself.\u201d Tr. of Oral 41; see id., at 33\u201334. Dotson de\u00ad\nclared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner\u2019s claim\nwould not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release,\u201d that claim does not lie at\n\u201cthe core of habeas corpus,\u201d and may be brought, if at all, under \u00a71983.\n544 U. S., at 82 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee id., at 85\u201386 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Whatever might be said of\nSwitzer\u2019s argument were we to recast our doctrine, Switzer\u2019s position\ncannot be reconciled with the line our precedent currently draws. Nor\ncan the dissent\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cretur[n] to first principles.\u201d Post, at 7.\nGiven the importance of providing clear guidance to the lower courts,\n\u201cwe again see no reason for moving the line our cases draw.\u201d Dotson,\n544 U.

S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprojected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible\nregarding DNA testing claims, for Osborne has rejected\nsubstantive due process as a basis for such claims. See\nsupra, at 2.\n   More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321\u201366, Congress has placed a\nseries of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to\nprevent sportive filings in federal court. See, e.g., PLRA\n\u00a7803(d) (adding 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e to create new proce\u00ad\ndures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under \u00a71983);\nPLRA \u00a7804(a)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(b)(1) to require\nany prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full\nfiling fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account);\nPLRA \u00a7804(c)(3) (adding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(f) to require\nprisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed\nagainst them out of their prison trust account); PLRA\n\u00a7804(d) (adding 28 U. S. C. \u00a71915(g) to revoke, with lim\u00ad\nited exception, in forma pauperis privileges for any pris\u00ad\noner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state\na claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 596\u2013597 (1998) (PLRA aims to\n\u201cdiscourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely\nto succeed,\u201d and statistics suggest that the Act is \u201chaving\nits intended effect\u201d).\n   Nor do we see any cause for concern that today\u2019s ruling\nwill spill over to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373\nU. S. 83 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion.\nBrady announced a constitutional requirement addressed\nfirst and foremost to the prosecution\u2019s conduct pretrial.\nBrady proscribes withholding evidence \u201cfavorable to an\naccused\u201d and \u201cmaterial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\u201d\nCone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). To\nestablish that a Brady violation undermines a conviction,\na convicted defendant must make each of three showings:\n(1) the evidence at issue is \u201cfavorable to the accused,\neither because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeach\u00ad\n14                  SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning\u201d; (2) the State suppressed the evidence, \u201ceither will\u00ad\nfully or inadvertently\u201d; and (3) \u201cprejudice . . . ensued.\u201d\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281\u2013282 (1999); see\nBanks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 691 (2004).\n   Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory,\nincriminating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim,\nwhen successful postconviction, necessarily yields evi\u00ad\ndence undermining a conviction: Brady evidence is, by\ndefinition, always favorable to the defendant and material\nto his guilt or punishment. See Strickler, 527 U. S., at\n296. And parties asserting Brady violations postconvic\u00ad\ntion generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for\n\u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from imprisonment. See\nDotson, 544 U. S., at 82. Accordingly, Brady claims have\nranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and\noutside the province of \u00a71983. See Heck, 512 U. S., at\n479, 490 (claim that prosecutors and an investigator had\n\u201c \u2018knowingly destroyed\u2019 evidence \u2018which was exculpatory in\nnature and could have proved [petitioner\u2019s] innocence\u2019 \u201d\ncannot be maintained under \u00a71983); Amaker v.

Like Osborne, Skinner seeks\nto challenge state collateral review procedures.2 I would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 I adopt the majority\u2019s view that Skinner has alleged a violation of\n\nprocedural due process despite the fact that his complaint is more\nnaturally read as alleging a violation of substantive due process. I also\nignore the questionable premise that the requested relief\u2014DNA test\ning\u2014would be available in a procedural due process challenge. Com\npare Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.

Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973); see, e.g., Heck v. Hum\nphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 485 (1994) (\u00a71983 should not \u201cexpand\nopportunities for collateral attack\u201d). But this Court has\nnever purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of\n\u00a71983. Cf. id., at 482. Rather, we have evaluated each\nclaim as it has come before us, reasoning from first princi\nples and our prior decisions.\n  In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Court began with the undis\nputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use \u00a71983\nto \u201cchalleng[e] his underlying conviction and sentence on\nfederal constitutional grounds.\u201d 411 U. S., at 489. This\nincluded attacks on the trial procedures. See id., at 486\n(\u201cden[ial] [of] constitutional rights at trial\u201d). From there,\nthe Court reasoned that \u201cimmediate release from [physi\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npostconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a\nstate habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See\nArd v. State, 191 S. W. 3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does\nnot itself \u201cprovide a vehicle for obtaining relief,\u201d Ex parte Tuley, 109\nS. W. 3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and\nby nature part of Texas\u2019 collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 8 (\u201cBecause [Article 64] does not give the convicting court\nauthority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a\nhabeas proceeding to challenge the conviction\u201d).\n  Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner\u2019s due process chal\nlenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a\nmotion under Article 64 is an \u201capplication for . . . collateral review\u201d\nunder 28 U.

Id., at 489; see also Wolff\nv. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974) (refusing to allow a\n\u00a71983 suit for restoration of good-time credits); Edwards v.\nBalisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997) (refusing to allow a \u00a71983\nprocedural challenge to the process used to revoke good\ntime credits). Then, in Heck v. Humphrey, we addressed\n\u00a71983 actions seeking damages. 512 U. S., at 483. De\ntermining that such actions were not covered by Preiser,\nwe returned to \u201cthe hoary principle that civil tort actions\nare not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments,\u201d 512 U. S., at 486, and\nconcluded that a complaint must be dismissed where \u201ca\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\nthe invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d id., at 487.\nMost recently, in Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 82\n(2005), we applied the principles from these prior decisions\nand found cognizable under \u00a71983 a claim that sought to\n\u201crender invalid the state procedures used to deny parole\neligibility . . . and parole suitability.\u201d\n                             II\n   We have not previously addressed whether due process\nchallenges to state collateral review procedures may be\nbrought under \u00a71983, and I would hold that they may not.\nChallenges to all state procedures for reviewing the valid\nity of a conviction should be treated the same as chal\nlenges to state trial procedures, which we have already\nrecognized may not be brought under \u00a71983. Moreover,\nallowing such challenges under \u00a71983 would undermine\nCongress\u2019 strict limitations on federal review of state\nhabeas decisions. If cognizable at all, Skinner\u2019s claim\nsounds in habeas corpus.\n   First, for the purposes of the Due Process Clause, the\nprocess of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all\nprocedures\u2014including collateral review procedures\u2014that\n4                   SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nestablish and review the validity of a conviction. This has\nlong been recognized for direct appellate review:\n    \u201cAnd while the Fourteenth Amendment does not re\n    quire that a State shall provide for an appellate re\n    view in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that\n    where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner\n    has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appel\n    late tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process\n    of law under which he is held in custody by the State,\n    and to be considered in determining any question of\n    alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the\n    Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Frank v. Mangum, 237\n    U. S. 309, 327 (1915) (citations omitted).\nSimilarly, although a State is not required to provide\nprocedures for postconviction review, it seems clear that\nwhen state collateral review procedures are provided for,\nthey too are part of the \u201cprocess of law under which [a\nprisoner] is held in custody by the State.\u201d Ibid. As this\nCourt has explained, when considering whether the State\nhas provided all the process that is due in depriving an\nindividual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both\npre- and post-deprivation process. See Cleveland Bd. of\nEd. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 547, n. 12 (1985) (\u201c[T]he\nexistence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the\nnecessary scope of pretermination procedures\u201d); see also\nNational Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm\u2019n, 515 U. S. 582, 587 (1995); Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319, 349 (1976). There is no principled reason\nthis Court should refuse to allow \u00a71983 suits to challenge\npart of this process\u2014the trial proceedings\u2014but bless the\nuse of \u00a71983 to challenge other parts.\n  Collateral review procedures are, of course, \u201cnot part of\nthe criminal proceeding itself.\u201d Pennsylvania v. Finley,\n481 U. S. 551, 557 (1987). But like trial and direct appel\nlate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nTrial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner;\nappellate procedures review the validity of that conviction\nbefore it becomes final; and collateral review procedures\npermit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For\npurposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds\nof \u00a71983, I think it makes sense to treat similarly all\nconstitutional challenges to procedures concerning the\nvalidity of a conviction. See Heck, supra, at 491 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[I]t is proper for the Court to devise\nlimitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between\nhabeas and \u00a71983], provided that it does so in a principled\nfashion\u201d).\n   Second, \u201cprinciples of federalism and comity [are] at\nstake\u201d when federal courts review state collateral review\nprocedures, just as when they review state trial proce\ndures. Osborne, 557 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 2). An attack in federal court on any \u201cstate\njudicial action\u201d concerning a state conviction must proceed\nwith \u201cproper respect for state functions,\u201d because the\nfederal courts are being asked to \u201ctr[y] the regularity of\nproceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d\nPreiser, 411 U. S., at 491 (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted).\n   Because of these concerns for federal-state comity,\nCongress has strictly limited the procedures for federal\nhabeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas\ndecisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner\nmay seek relief in federal court, he must \u201cexhaus[t] the\nremedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive\nsignificant deference in subsequent federal habeas pro\nceedings. \u00a72254(d). These requirements ensure that the\nstate courts have the first opportunity to correct any error\nwith a state conviction and that their rulings receive due\nrespect in subsequent federal challenges.\n   By bringing a procedural challenge under \u00a71983, Skin\n6                       SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner\nhas never presented his current challenge to Texas\u2019 proce\ndures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allow\ning Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas\nprocedures instead of an attack on state habeas results\nundercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have\nplaced on federal review of state convictions. See Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). To\nallege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on\ncollateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas\npetition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions\nand deferential review. But a successful challenge to\nTexas\u2019 collateral review procedures under \u00a71983 would\nimpeach the result of collateral review without complying\nwith any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.\n  The majority contends that its decision will not \u201cspill\nover to claims relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963).\u201d Ante, at 13; but cf. Osborne, supra, at ___\u2013___\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\u20135). In truth, the\nmajority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state\nhabeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under \u00a71983: After\nstate habeas is denied, file a \u00a71983 suit challenging the\nstate habeas process rather than the result. What pris\noner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the\napple?3\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court\u2019s holding will be\n\ncabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss\nwhether a State\u2019s direct review process may be subject to challenge\nunder \u00a71983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct\nand collateral review. This risks transforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for\ndirect criminal appeals. Cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 486\n(1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort\nto \u00a71983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will\nunsuccessful appellants turn to \u00a71983 to challenge the state appellate\nprocedures.\n                    Cite as: 562 U.

In\nthat case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in\nstate parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and\n\u201ca new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally\nproper procedures.\u201d 544 U. S., at 77. We found the claims\ncognizable under \u00a71983.\n   Dotson does not control this case. Unlike state collateral\nreview, parole does not evaluate the validity of the under\nlying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review per\nmits prisoners to \u201cattack their final convictions.\u201d Osborne,\nsupra, at ___ (ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). In\ncontrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a\nprisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the\nunderlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correct\nness of Dotson, parole procedures do not review the valid\nity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting\nreview of parole procedures does not similarly risk trans\nforming \u00a71983 into a vehicle for \u201cchallenging the validity\nof outstanding criminal judgments.\u201d Heck, 512 U. S., at\n486.\n   Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, Dotson did not\nreduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under\n\u00a71983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner\u2019s claim\nwould \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release.\u201d See ante, at 11,\n12, n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).4 As we\nrecognized in Heck, evaluating the boundaries of \u00a71983 is\nnot a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief\nsought was not \u201cspeedier release,\u201d we inquired further\nand returned to first principles to determine that the chal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a con\n\nviction, a \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release\u201d test may sufficiently\nsummarize the analysis of \u00a71983 challenges to parole procedures. But\n\u201cnecessarily spell speedier release\u201d cannot be the only limit when a\nprisoner challenges procedures used to review the validity of the\nunderlying conviction.\n8                      SKINNER v. SWITZER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlenge in that case was not cognizable under \u00a71983.5 See\n512 U. S., at 486. Dotson does not suggest that the Heck\napproach, which I would continue to follow here, was\nincorrect.\n                         *    *    *\n   This Court has struggled to limit \u00a71983 and prevent it\nfrom intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In\ncrafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seek\ning \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from confinement fall\noutside its scope. Dotson, supra, at 82. We found another\nlimit when faced with a civil action in which \u201ca judgment\nin favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the inva\nlidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d Heck, supra, at 487.\nThis case calls for yet another: due process challenges to\nstate procedures used to review the validity of a conviction\nor sentence. Under that rule, Skinner\u2019s claim is not cogni\nzable under \u00a71983, and the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 As respondent argued, our existing formulations are not \u201cthe end of\n\nthe test.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\u201333.\n</pre>",
