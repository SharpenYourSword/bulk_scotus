STEVEN FRANK JACKSON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 10\u2013797.   Decided March 21, 2011 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank\nJackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his\nattack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment\ncomplex. Jackson raised a Batson claim, asserting that\nthe prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude\nblack prospective jurors on the basis of their race. See\nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). Two of three\nblack jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49\u201350.\n  Jackson\u2019s counsel did not object when the prosecutor\nstruck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel later\nexplained that he did not make a \u201cmotion at that time\u201d\nbecause he thought the excusal of Juror S \u201cwas a close\ncall.\u201d After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second\njuror, Juror J, Jackson\u2019s counsel made the Batson motion\nchallenging both strikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB\n(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76\u201377 (hereinaf\nter Document 7).\n  The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for\nstriking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages\nof 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by Cali\nfornia police officers because\u2014in his view\u2014of his race and\nage. As the prosecutor put it, \u201cWhether or not he still\nharbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll\nthe dice with.\u201d Id., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB\n(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57\u201358, 98\u2013100\n(hereinafter Document 10).\n  The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because\n2                   FELKNER v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nshe had a master\u2019s degree in social work, and had interned\nat the county jail, \u201cprobably in the psych unit as a sociolo\ngist of some sort.\u201d The prosecutor explained that he dis\nmissed her \u201cbased on her educational background,\u201d stating\nthat he does not \u201clike to keep social workers.\u201d Document\n7, at 78\u201379; Document 10, at 188\u2013189; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 49.\n   Jackson\u2019s counsel expressly disagreed only with the\nprosecutor\u2019s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 22\u201323, 47, arguing that removing her on\nthe basis of her educational background was \u201citself invidi\nous discrimination.\u201d The prosecutor responded that he\nwas not aware that social workers were a \u201cprotected\nclass.\u201d As for Juror S, Jackson\u2019s counsel explained that he\n\u201clet [Juror S] slide\u201d because he anticipated the prosecutor\u2019s\nresponse and, in any event, he \u201conly need[ed] one to estab\nlish the grounds for\u201d a Batson motion. After listening to\neach side\u2019s arguments, the trial court denied Jackson\u2019s\nmotion. Document 7, at 78\u201380.\n   Jackson renewed his Batson claim on direct appeal,\narguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s explanations were pretextual.          With\nrespect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a non-black ju\nror\u2014Juror 8\u2014also had negative experiences with law\nenforcement but remained on the jury. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47\u201348. Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he\nhad been stopped while driving in Illinois several years\nearlier as part of what he believed to be a \u201cscam\u201d by Illi\nnois police targeting drivers with California license plates.\nJuror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by\nthe failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the\nburglary of his car. Document 10, at 26\u201327, 56\u201357, 95\u201397.\n   With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prose\ncutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors\nwhen he was concerned about their educational back\ngrounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any ques\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

App. to Pet. for\nCert. 49.\n   The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s\ndenial of the Batson motion and affirmed Jackson\u2019s convic\ntions. The appellate court explained that \u201c[t]he trial\ncourt\u2019s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial\nevidence,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), which the California courts have charac\nterized as equivalent to the \u201cclear error\u201d standard em\nployed by federal courts, see, e.g., People v. Alvarez, 14\nCal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P. 2d 365, 389 (1996). With respect\nto whether the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were pretex\ntual, the court explained that it \u201cgive[s] great deference to\nthe trial court\u2019s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons\nfrom sham excuses.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.\n   After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded\nthat \u201cJuror 8\u2019s negative experience out of state and the car\nburglary is not comparable to [Juror S\u2019s] 14 years of per\nceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on\nrace.\u201d Id., at 48. As for Juror J, the court recognized that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s dismissal was based on her social services\nbackground\u2014\u201ca proper race-neutral reason\u201d\u2014and that\nthis explained his different treatment of jurors with\n\u201cbackgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental\nengineering.\u201d The court also noted that the \u201cprosecutor\nfocused on [Juror J\u2019s] internship experience\u201d at the county\njail. Id., at 49.\n   After the California Supreme Court denied Jackson\u2019s\npetition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief.\nThe Federal District Court properly recognized that re\nview of Jackson\u2019s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That\nlaw provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief\nmay not be granted unless the state court adjudication\n\u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence pre\n4                   FELKNER v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsented in the State court proceeding.\u201d          28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal\ndecision and reviewing the record evidence, the District\nCourt held that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s findings\nwere not unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The\nDistrict Court therefore denied Jackson\u2019s petition.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a\nthree-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389\nFed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not\ndiscuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the\nother three courts that had rejected Jackson\u2019s claim.\nInstead, after setting forth the basic background legal\nprinciples in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Ap\npeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its\ndecision:\n       \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s proffered race-neutral bases for\n    peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors\n    were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purpose\n    ful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of\n    three prospective African-American jurors were\n    stricken, and the record reflected different treatment\n    of comparably situated jurors.\u201d Id., at 641.\nThat decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained. It is\nreversed.\n   The Batson issue before us turns largely on an \u201cevalua\ntion of credibility.\u201d 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21. The trial\ncourt\u2019s determination is entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201d ibid.,\nand \u201cmust be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,\u201d\nSnyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (2008).\n   That is the standard on direct review. On federal ha\nbeas review, AEDPA \u201cimposes a highly deferential stan\ndard for evaluating state-court rulings\u201d and \u201cdemands\nthat state-court decisions be given the benefit of the\ndoubt.\u201d Renico v.
