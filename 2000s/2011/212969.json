SIRACUSANO\n                    ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09\u20131156. Argued January 10, 2011\u2014Decided March 22, 2011\nRespondents filed this securities fraud class action, alleging that peti\n  tioners (hereinafter Matrixx) violated \u00a710(b) of the Securities Ex\n  change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule\n  10b\u20135 by failing to disclose reports of a possible link between Ma\n  trixx\u2019s leading product, Zicam Cold Remedy, and loss of smell (anos\n  mia), rendering statements made by Matrixx misleading. Matrixx\n  moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that respondents had not\n  pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the\n  element of scienter. The District Court granted the motion, but the\n  Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that the District Court erred in re\n  quiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish material\n  ity, concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged infor\n  mation linking Zicam and anosmia that would have been significant\n  to a reasonable investor. It also held that Matrixx\u2019s withholding of\n  information about reports of adverse effects and about pending law\n  suits by Zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.\nHeld: Respondents have stated a claim under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135.\n Pp. 8\u201322.\n    (a) To prevail on their claim, respondents must prove, as relevant\n here, a material misrepresentation or omission by Matrixx and sci\n enter. See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,\n Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157. Matrixx contends that they failed to plead\n these required elements because they did not allege that the reports\n Matrixx received reflected statistically significant evidence that Zi\n cam caused anosmia. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    (b) Respondents have adequately pleaded materiality. Pp. 9\u201319.\n      (1) Under Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, \u00a710(b)\u2019s material\n2            MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ity requirement is satisfied when there is \u201c \u2018a substantial likelihood\n    that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the\n    reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of\n    information made available.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 231\u2013232. The Court declined to\n    adopt a bright-line rule for determining materiality in Basic, observ\n    ing that \u201c[a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as\n    always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as\n    materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.\u201d\n    Id., at 236. Here, Matrixx\u2019s bright-line rule\u2014that adverse event re\n    ports regarding a pharmaceutical company\u2019s products are not mate\n    rial absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statisti\n    cally significant risk that the product is causing the events\u2014would\n    \u201cartificially exclud[e]\u201d information that \u201cwould otherwise be consid\n    ered significant to [a reasonable investor\u2019s] trading decision.\u201d Ibid.\n    Matrixx\u2019s premise that statistical significance is the only reliable in\n    dication of causation is flawed. Both medical experts and the Food\n    and Drug Administration rely on evidence other than statistically\n    significant data to establish an inference of causation. It thus stands\n    to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence. Be\n    cause adverse reports can take many forms, assessing their material\n    ity is a fact-specific inquiry, requiring consideration of their source,\n    content, and context. The question is whether a reasonable investor\n    would have viewed the nondisclosed information \u201c \u2018as having signifi\n    cantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information made available.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n    232. Something more than the mere existence of adverse event re\n    ports is needed to satisfy that standard, but that something more is\n    not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source,\n    content, and context of the reports. Pp. 9\u201316.\n         (2) Applying Basic\u2019s \u201ctotal mix\u201d standard here, respondents ade\n    quately pleaded materiality. The complaint\u2019s allegations suffice to\n    \u201craise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u201d\n    satisfying the materiality requirement, Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\n    Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 556, and to \u201callo[w] the court to draw the\n    reasonable inference that the defendant is liable,\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n    556 U. S. ___, ___. Assuming the complaint\u2019s allegations to be true,\n    Matrixx received reports from medical experts and researchers that\n    plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between Zicam and anos\n    mia. Consumers likely would have viewed Zicam\u2019s risk as substan\n    tially outweighing its benefit. Viewing the complaint\u2019s allegations as\n    a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to\n    the commercial viability of Matrixx\u2019s leading product. It is substan\n    tially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this infor\n    mation \u201c \u2018as having significantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of informa\n    tion made available.\u2019 \u201d       Basic, supra, at 232.     Assuming the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

It also publicly dismissed reports linking Zicam and anos\n  mia and stated that zinc gluconate\u2019s safety was well established,\n  when it had evidence of a biological link between Zicam\u2019s key ingre\n  dient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that\n  link. Pp. 16\u201319.\n     (c) Respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter, \u201c \u2018a mental\n  state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u2019 \u201d Tellabs,\n  Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. This Court\n  assumes, without deciding, that the scienter requirement may be sat\n  isfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness. Under the Private Se\n  curities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a complaint adequately pleads\n  scienter \u201conly if a reasonable person would deem the inference of sci\n  enter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one\n  could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d Id., at 324. Matrixx\u2019s proposed\n  bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to\n  establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed. The\n  complaint\u2019s allegations, \u201ctaken collectively,\u201d give rise to a \u201ccogent and\n  compelling\u201d inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose adverse\n  event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but be\n  cause it understood their likely effect on the market. Id., at 323, 324.\n  \u201c[A] reasonable person\u201d would deem the inference that Matrixx acted\n  with deliberate recklessness \u201cat least as compelling as any [plausible]\n  opposing inference.\u201d Id., at 324.

S. C. \u00a778j(b), and Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) Rule 10b\u20135, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2010), based on a\npharmaceutical company\u2019s failure to disclose reports of\nadverse events associated with a product if the reports do\nnot disclose a statistically significant number of adverse\nevents. Respondents, plaintiffs in a securities fraud class\naction, allege that petitioners, Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.,\nand three of its executives (collectively Matrixx), failed to\ndisclose reports of a possible link between its leading\nproduct, a cold remedy, and loss of smell, rendering state\u00ad\nments made by Matrixx misleading. Matrixx contends\nthat respondents\u2019 complaint does not adequately allege\nthat Matrixx made a material representation or omission\nor that it acted with scienter because the complaint does\nnot allege that Matrixx knew of a statistically significant\nnumber of adverse events requiring disclosure. We con\u00ad\nclude that the materiality of adverse event reports cannot\n2         MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbe reduced to a bright-line rule. Although in many cases\nreasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse\nevents to be material information, respondents have al\u00ad\nleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors\nwould have viewed these particular reports as material.\nRespondents have also alleged facts \u201cgiving rise to a\nstrong inference\u201d that Matrixx \u201cacted with the required\nstate of mind.\u201d 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011\nSupp.). We therefore hold, in agreement with the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, that respondents have\nstated a claim under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Through a wholly owned subsidiary, Matrixx develops,\nmanufactures, and markets over-the-counter pharmaceu\u00ad\ntical products. Its core brand of products is called Zicam.\nAll of the products sold under the name Zicam are used to\ntreat the common cold and associated symptoms. At the\ntime of the events in question, one of Matrixx\u2019s products\nwas Zicam Cold Remedy, which came in several forms\nincluding nasal spray and gel. The active ingredient in\nZicam Cold Remedy was zinc gluconate. Respondents\nallege that Zicam Cold Remedy accounted for approxi\u00ad\nmately 70 percent of Matrixx\u2019s sales.\n   Respondents initiated this securities fraud class action\nagainst Matrixx on behalf of individuals who purchased\nMatrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and Febru\u00ad\nary 6, 2004.1 The action principally arises out of state\u00ad\nments that Matrixx made during the class period relating\nto revenues and product safety. Respondents claim that\nMatrixx\u2019s statements were misleading in light of reports\nthat Matrixx had received, but did not disclose, about\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 According to the complaint, Matrixx securities were traded on the\n\nNASDAQ National Market.

Respon\u00ad\ndents\u2019 consolidated amended complaint alleges the follow\u00ad\ning facts, which the courts below properly assumed to be\ntrue. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 14).\n  In 1999, Dr. Alan Hirsch, neurological director of the\nSmell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, Ltd.,\ncalled Matrixx\u2019s customer service line after discovering a\npossible link between Zicam nasal gel and a loss of smell\n\u201cin a cluster of his patients.\u201d App. 67a\u201368a. Dr. Hirsch\ntold a Matrixx employee that \u201cprevious studies had dem\u00ad\nonstrated that intranasal application of zinc could be\nproblematic.\u201d Id., at 68a. He also told the employee about\nat least one of his patients who did not have a cold and\nwho developed anosmia after using Zicam.\n  In September 2002, Timothy Clarot, Matrixx\u2019s vice\npresident for research and development, called Miriam\nLinschoten, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado Health\nSciences Center after receiving a complaint from a per\u00ad\nson Linschoten was treating who had lost her sense of\nsmell after using Zicam. Clarot informed Linschoten that\nMatrixx had received similar complaints from other cus\u00ad\ntomers. Linschoten drew Clarot\u2019s attention to \u201cprevious\nstudies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.\u201d Ibid. Clarot\ngave her the impression that he had not heard of the\nstudies. She asked Clarot whether Matrixx had done any\nstudies of its own; he responded that it had not but that it\nhad hired a consultant to review the product. Soon there\u00ad\nafter, Linschoten sent Clarot abstracts of the studies she\nhad mentioned. Research from the 1930\u2019s and 1980\u2019s had\nconfirmed \u201c[z]inc\u2019s toxicity.\u201d Id., at 69a. Clarot called\nLinschoten to ask whether she would be willing to partici\u00ad\npate in animal studies that Matrixx was planning, but she\ndeclined because her focus was human research.\n  By September 2003, one of Linschoten\u2019s colleagues at\n4          MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe University of Colorado, Dr. Bruce Jafek, had observed\n10 patients suffering from anosmia after Zicam use.\nLinschoten and Jafek planned to present their findings at\na meeting of the American Rhinologic Society in a poster\npresentation entitled \u201cZicam\u00ae Induced Anosmia.\u201d Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The American Rhi\u00ad\nnologic Society posted their abstract in advance of the\nmeeting. The presentation described in detail a 55-year\u00ad\nold man with previously normal taste and smell who\nexperienced severe burning in his nose, followed immedi\u00ad\nately by a loss of smell, after using Zicam. It also reported\n10 other Zicam users with similar symptoms.\n   Matrixx learned of the doctors\u2019 planned presentation.\nClarot sent a letter to Dr. Jafek warning him that he did\nnot have permission to use Matrixx\u2019s name or the names\nof its products. Dr. Jafek deleted the references to Zicam\nin the poster before presenting it to the American Rhi\u00ad\nnologic Society.\n   The following month, two plaintiffs commenced a prod\u00ad\nuct liability lawsuit against Matrixx alleging that Zicam\nhad damaged their sense of smell. By the end of the class\nperiod on February 6, 2004, nine plaintiffs had filed four\nlawsuits.\n   Respondents allege that Matrixx made a series of public\nstatements that were misleading in light of the foregoing\ninformation. In October 2003, after they had learned of\nDr. Jafek\u2019s study and after Dr. Jafek had presented his\nfindings to the American Rhinologic Society, Matrixx\nstated that Zicam was \u201c \u2018poised for growth in the upcoming\ncough and cold season\u2019 \u201d and that the company had \u201c \u2018very\nstrong momentum.\u2019 \u201d2 Id., at 72a\u201374a.

In\nJanuary 2004, Matrixx raised its revenue guidance, pre\u00ad\ndicting an increase in revenues of 80 percent and earnings\nper share in the 33-to-38-cent range.\n   In its Form 10\u2013Q filed with the SEC in November 2003,\nZicam warned of the potential \u201c \u2018material adverse effect\u2019 \u201d\nthat could result from product liability claims, \u201c \u2018whether\nor not proven to be valid.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 75a\u201376a. It stated that\nproduct liability actions could materially affect Matrixx\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018product branding and goodwill,\u2019 \u201d leading to reduced\ncustomer acceptance.3 Id., at 76a. It did not disclose,\nhowever, that two plaintiffs had already sued Matrixx for\nallegedly causing them to lose their sense of smell.\n   On January 30, 2004, Dow Jones Newswires reported\nthat the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was \u201c \u2018look\u00ad\ning into complaints that an over-the-counter common-cold\nmedicine manufactured by a unit of Matrixx Initiatives,\nInc. (MTXX) may be causing some users to lose their sense\nof smell\u2019 \u201d in light of at least three product liability law\u00ad\nsuits. Id., at 79a\u201380a. Matrixx\u2019s stock fell from $13.55 to\n$11.97 per share after the report. In response, on Febru\u00ad\nary 2, Matrixx issued a press release that stated:\n       \u201cAll Zicam products are manufactured and mar\u00ad\n     keted according to FDA guidelines for homeopathic\n     medicine. Our primary concern is the health and\n     safety of our customers and the distribution of fac-\n     tual information about our products. Matrixx believes\n     statements alleging that intranasal Zicam products\n     caused anosmia (loss of smell) are completely un\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Respondents    also allege that Matrixx falsely reported its financial\nresults in the Form 10\u2013Q by failing to reserve for or disclose potential\nliability, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The\nCourt of Appeals did not rely on these allegations.\n6        MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    founded and misleading.\n      \u201cIn no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel\n    products has there been a single report of lost or di\u00ad\n    minished olfactory function (sense of smell). Rather,\n    the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treat\u00ad\n    ment of symptoms related to the common cold have\n    been well established in two double-blind, placebo\u00ad\n    controlled, randomized clinical trials. In fact, in nei\u00ad\n    ther study were there any reports of anosmia related\n    to the use of this compound. The overall incidence of\n    adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was ex\u00ad\n    tremely low, with no statistically significant difference\n    between the adverse event rates for the treated and\n    placebo subsets.\n      \u201cA multitude of environmental and biologic influ\u00ad\n    ences are known to affect the sense of smell. Chief\n    among them is the common cold. As a result, the\n    population most likely to use cold remedy products is\n    already at increased risk of developing anosmia.\n    Other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include\n    age, nasal and sinus infections, head trauma, ana\u00ad\n    tomical obstructions, and environmental irritants.\u201d\n    Id., at 77a\u201378a (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe day after Matrixx issued this press release, its stock\nprice bounced back to $13.40 per share.\n  On February 6, 2004, the end of the class period, Good\nMorning America, a nationally broadcast morning news\nprogram, highlighted Dr. Jafek\u2019s findings. (The complaint\ndoes not allege that Matrixx learned of the news story\nbefore its broadcast.)

See 485 U. S., at 227\u2013229. The\ndefendant urged a bright-line rule that preliminary\nmerger negotiations are material only once the parties to\nthe negotiations reach an agreement in principle.

Accordingly,\nit contends, reasonable investors would not consider such\nreports relevant unless they are statistically significant\nbecause only then do they \u201creflect a scientifically reliable\nbasis for inferring a potential causal link between product\nuse and the adverse event.\u201d Id., at 32.\n   As in Basic, Matrixx\u2019s categorical rule would \u201cartificially\nexclud[e]\u201d information that \u201cwould otherwise be consid\u00ad\nered significant to the trading decision of a reasonable\ninvestor.\u201d 485 U.

This premise is flawed: As the\nSEC points out, \u201cmedical researchers . . . consider multiple\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nadverse events to the FDA. During the class period, manufacturers of\nover-the-counter drugs such as Zicam Cold Remedy had no obligation to\nreport adverse events to the FDA. In 2006, Congress enacted legisla\u00ad\ntion to require manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs to report any\n\u201cserious adverse event\u201d to the FDA within 15 business days. See 21\nU. S.

To test for\nsignificance, a researcher develops a \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d\u2014e.g., the asser\u00ad\ntion that there is no relationship between Zicam use and anosmia. See\nid., at 122. The researcher then calculates the probability of obtaining\nthe observed data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis is true\n(called the p-value). Ibid. Small p-values are evidence that the null\nhypothesis is incorrect. See ibid. Finally, the researcher compares the\np-value to a preselected value called the significance level. Id., at 123.\nIf the p-value is below the preselected value, the difference is deemed\n\u201csignificant.\u201d Id., at 124.\n12            MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v.

Statistically significant data are not\nalways available. For example, when an adverse event is\nsubtle or rare, \u201can inability to obtain a data set of appro\u00ad\npriate quality or quantity may preclude a finding of statis\u00ad\ntical significance.\u201d Id., at 15; see also Brief for Medical\nResearchers as Amici Curiae 11. Moreover, ethical con\u00ad\nsiderations may prohibit researchers from conducting\nrandomized clinical trials to confirm a suspected causal\nlink for the purpose of obtaining statistically significant\ndata. See id., at 10\u201311.\n   A lack of statistically significant data does not mean\nthat medical experts have no reliable basis for inferring a\ncausal link between a drug and adverse events. As Ma\u00ad\ntrixx itself concedes, medical experts rely on other evi\u00ad\ndence to establish an inference of causation. See Brief for\nPetitioners 44\u201345, n. 22.7 We note that courts frequently\npermit expert testimony on causation based on evidence\nother than statistical significance. See, e.g., Best v. Lowe\u2019s\nHome Centers, Inc., 563 F. 3d 171, 178 (CA6 2009); West\nberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, 178 F. 3d 257, 263\u2013264 (CA4\n1999) (citing cases); Wells v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.,\n788 F. 2d 741, 744\u2013745 (CA11 1986). We need not con\u00ad\nsider whether the expert testimony was properly admitted\nin those cases, and we do not attempt to define here what\nconstitutes reliable evidence of causation.

As a result, assessing\nthe materiality of adverse event reports is a \u201cfact-specific\u201d\ninquiry, Basic, 485 U.

Adverse event reports\nare daily events in the pharmaceutical industry; in\n2009, the FDA entered nearly 500,000 such reports into\nits reporting system, see FDA, Reports Received and\nReports Entered in AERS by Year (as of Mar. 31, 2010),\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory\nInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070434.\nhtm. The fact that a user of a drug has suffered an\nadverse event, standing alone, does not mean that\nthe drug caused that event. See FDA, Annual Adverse\nDrug Experience Report: 1996, p. 2 (1997), http://drugand\ndevicelaw.net/Annual%20Adverse%20Drug%20Experience\n%20Report%201996.pdf.

For the reasons just stated, the mere existence of\nreports of adverse events\u2014which says nothing in and of\nitself about whether the drug is causing the adverse\nevents\u2014will not satisfy this standard. Something more is\nneeded, but that something more is not limited to statisti\u00ad\ncal significance and can come from \u201cthe source, content,\nand context of the reports,\u201d supra, at 15. This contextual\ninquiry may reveal in some cases that reasonable inves\u00ad\ntors would have viewed reports of adverse events as mate\u00ad\nrial even though the reports did not provide statistically\nsignificant evidence of a causal link.10\n   Moreover, it bears emphasis that \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u2013\n5(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and\nall material information.

Assuming the complaint\u2019s\nallegations to be true, as we must, Matrixx received in\u00ad\nformation that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link\nbetween Zicam and anosmia. That information included\nreports from three medical professionals and researchers\nabout more than 10 patients who had lost their sense of\nsmell after using Zicam. Clarot told Linschoten that\nMatrixx had received additional reports of anosmia. (In\naddition, during the class period, nine plaintiffs com\u00ad\nmenced four product liability lawsuits against Matrixx\nalleging a causal link between Zicam use and anosmia.)11\nFurther, Matrixx knew that Linschoten and Dr. Jafek had\npresented their findings about a causal link between\nZicam and anosmia to a national medical conference de\u00ad\nvoted to treatment of diseases of the nose.12 Their presen\u00ad\ntation described a patient who experienced severe burning\nin his nose, followed immediately by a loss of smell, after\nusing Zicam\u2014suggesting a temporal relationship between\nZicam use and anosmia.\n  Critically, both Dr. Hirsch and Linschoten had also\ndrawn Matrixx\u2019s attention to previous studies that had\ndemonstrated a biological causal link between intranasal\napplication of zinc and anosmia.13 Before his conversation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 It is unclear whether these plaintiffs were the same individuals\nwhose symptoms were reported by the medical professionals.\n  12 Matrixx contends that Dr. Jafek and Linschoten\u2019s study was not\n\nreliable because they did not sufficiently rule out the common cold as a\ncause for their patients\u2019 anosmia. We note that the complaint alleges\nthat, in one instance, a consumer who did not have a cold lost his sense\nof smell after using Zicam. More importantly, to survive a motion to\ndismiss, respondents need only allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU. S. 544, 570 (2007). For all the reasons we state in the opinion,\nrespondents\u2019 allegations plausibly suggest that Dr. Jafek and Linscho\u00ad\nten\u2019s conclusions were based on reliable evidence of a causal link\nbetween Zicam and anosmia.\n  13 Matrixx contends that these studies are not reliable evidence of\n18         MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Linschoten, Clarot, Matrixx\u2019s vice president of re\u00ad\nsearch and development, was seemingly unaware of these\nstudies, and the complaint suggests that, as of the class\nperiod, Matrixx had not conducted any research of its own\nrelating to anosmia. See, e.g., App. 84a (referencing a\npress report, issued after the end of the class period, not\u00ad\ning that Matrixx said it would begin conducting \u201c \u2018animal\nand human studies to further characterize these post\u00ad\nmarketing complaints\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, it can reasonably\nbe inferred from the complaint that Matrixx had no basis\nfor rejecting Dr. Jafek\u2019s findings out of hand.\n   We believe that these allegations suffice to \u201craise a\nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u201d\nsatisfying the materiality requirement, Bell Atlantic Corp.\nv. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 556 (2007), and to \u201callo[w] the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant\nis liable for the misconduct alleged,\u201d Iqbal, 556 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The information provided to Matrixx\nby medical experts revealed a plausible causal relation\u00ad\nship between Zicam Cold Remedy and anosmia. Consum\u00ad\ners likely would have viewed the risk associated with\nZicam (possible loss of smell) as substantially outweighing\nthe benefit of using the product (alleviating cold symp\u00ad\ntoms), particularly in light of the existence of many alter\u00ad\nnative products on the market. Importantly, Zicam Cold\nRemedy allegedly accounted for 70 percent of Matrixx\u2019s\nsales. Viewing the allegations of the complaint as a whole,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncausation because the studies used zinc sulfate, whereas the active\ningredient in Matrixx is zinc gluconate. Respondents\u2019 complaint,\nhowever, alleges that the studies confirmed the toxicity of \u201czinc.\u201d App.\n68a. Matrixx further contends that studies relating to fish cannot\nreliably prove causation with respect to humans. The complaint\nreferences several studies, however, only one of which involved fish. In\nany event, the existence of the studies suggests a plausible biological\nlink between zinc and anosmia, which, in combination with the other\nallegations, is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to\nthe commercial viability of Matrixx\u2019s leading product.\n    It is substantially likely that a reasonable investor\nwould have viewed this information \u201c \u2018as having signifi\u00ad\ncantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information made avail\u00ad\nable.\u2019 \u201d Basic, 485 U. S., at 232 (quoting TSC Industries,\n426 U. S., at 449). Matrixx told the market that revenues\nwere going to rise 50 and then 80 percent. Assuming the\ncomplaint\u2019s allegations to be true, however, Matrixx had\ninformation indicating a significant risk to its leading\nrevenue-generating product. Matrixx also stated that\nreports indicating that Zicam caused anosmia were \u201c \u2018com\u00ad\npletely unfounded and misleading\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the safety\nand efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symp\u00ad\ntoms related to the common cold have been well estab\u00ad\nlished.\u2019 \u201d App. 77a\u201378a. Importantly, however, Matrixx\nhad evidence of a biological link between Zicam\u2019s key\ningredient and anosmia, and it had not conducted any\nstudies of its own to disprove that link. In fact, as Matrixx\nlater revealed, the scientific evidence at that time was\n\u201c \u2018insufficient . . . to determine if zinc gluconate, when used\nas recommended, affects a person\u2019s ability to smell.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 82a.\n    Assuming the facts to be true, these were material facts\n\u201cnecessary in order to make the statements made, in the\nlight of the circumstances under which they were made,\nnot misleading.\u201d 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b). We therefore\naffirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that respondents\nadequately pleaded the element of a material misrepre\u00ad\nsentation or omission.\n                             B\n  Matrixx also argues that respondents failed to allege\nfacts plausibly suggesting that it acted with the required\nlevel of scienter. \u201cTo establish liability under \u00a710(b) and\nRule 10b\u20135, a private plaintiff must prove that the defen\u00ad\n20           MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v.

S., at\n319 (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185,\n193\u2013194, and n. 12 (1976)). We have not decided whether\nrecklessness suffices to fulfill the scienter requirement.\nSee Tellabs, 551 U. S., at 319, n. 3. Because Matrixx does\nnot challenge the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the\nscienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of\n\u201cdeliberate recklessness,\u201d see 585 F. 3d, at 1180 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), we assume, without deciding,\nthat the standard applied by the Court of Appeals is suffi\u00ad\ncient to establish scienter.14\n   Under the PSLRA, a plaintiff must \u201cstate with par\u00ad\nticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the\ndefendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15\nU.

A complaint\nadequately pleads scienter under the PSLRA \u201conly if a\nreasonable person would deem the inference of scienter\ncogent and at least as compelling as any opposing infer\u00ad\nence one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d Id., at 324.\nIn making this determination, the court must review \u201call\nthe allegations holistically.\u201d Id., at 326. The absence of a\nmotive allegation, though relevant, is not dispositive. Id.,\nat 325.\n   Matrixx argues, in summary fashion, that because\nrespondents do not allege that it knew of statistically\nsignificant evidence of causation, there is no basis to\nconsider the inference that it acted recklessly or know\u00ad\ningly to be at least as compelling as the alternative infer\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Under the PSLRA, if the alleged misstatement or omission is a\n\u201cforward-looking statement,\u201d the required level of scienter is \u201cactual\nknowledge.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20135(c)(1)(B). Matrixx has not argued that\nthe statements or omissions here are \u201cforward-looking statement[s].\u201d\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Matrixx\u2019s pro\u00ad\nposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical\nsignificance to establish a strong inference of scienter is\njust as flawed as its approach to materiality.\n   The inference that Matrixx acted recklessly (or inten\u00ad\ntionally, for that matter) is at least as compelling, if not\nmore compelling, than the inference that it simply thought\nthe reports did not indicate anything meaningful about\nadverse reactions. According to the complaint, Matrixx\nwas sufficiently concerned about the information it re\u00ad\nceived that it informed Linschoten that it had hired a\nconsultant to review the product, asked Linschoten to\nparticipate in animal studies, and convened a panel of\nphysicians and scientists in response to Dr. Jafek\u2019s pres\u00ad\nentation. It successfully prevented Dr. Jafek from using\nZicam\u2019s name in his presentation on the ground that he\nneeded Matrixx\u2019s permission to do so. Most significantly,\nMatrixx issued a press release that suggested that studies\nhad confirmed that Zicam does not cause anosmia when,\nin fact, it had not conducted any studies relating to anos\u00ad\nmia and the scientific evidence at that time, according to\nthe panel of scientists, was insufficient to determine\nwhether Zicam did or did not cause anosmia.15\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 One of Matrixx\u2019s amici argues that \u201cthe most cogent inference re\u00ad\n\ngarding Matrixx\u2019s state of mind is that it delayed releasing information\nregarding anosmia complaints in order to provide itself an opportunity\nto carefully review all evidence regarding any link between Zicam and\nanosmia.\u201d Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae\n26. We do not doubt that this may be the most cogent inference in some\ncases. Here, however, the misleading nature of Matrixx\u2019s press release\nis sufficient to render the inference of scienter at least as compelling as\nthe inference suggested by amicus.\n22       MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  These allegations, \u201ctaken collectively,\u201d give rise to a\n\u201ccogent and compelling\u201d inference that Matrixx elected not\nto disclose the reports of adverse events not because it\nbelieved they were meaningless but because it understood\ntheir likely effect on the market.

Argued January 10, 2011\u2014Decided March 22, 2011\nRespondents filed this securities fraud class action, alleging that peti\n  tioners (hereinafter Matrixx) violated \u00a710(b) of the Securities Ex\n  change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule\n  10b\u20135 by failing to disclose reports of a possible link between Ma\n  trixx\u2019s leading product, Zicam Cold Remedy, and loss of smell (anos\n  mia), rendering statements made by Matrixx misleading. Matrixx\n  moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that respondents had not\n  pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the\n  element of scienter. The District Court granted the motion, but the\n  Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that the District Court erred in re\n  quiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish material\n  ity, concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged infor\n  mation linking Zicam and anosmia that would have been significant\n  to a reasonable investor. It also held that Matrixx\u2019s withholding of\n  information about reports of adverse effects and about pending law\n  suits by Zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.\nHeld: Respondents have stated a claim under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135.\n Pp. 8\u201322.\n    (a) To prevail on their claim, respondents must prove, as relevant\n here, a material misrepresentation or omission by Matrixx and sci\n enter. See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,\n Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157.

The Court declined to\n    adopt a bright-line rule for determining materiality in Basic, observ\n    ing that \u201c[a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as\n    always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as\n    materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.\u201d\n    Id., at 236. Here, Matrixx\u2019s bright-line rule\u2014that adverse event re\n    ports regarding a pharmaceutical company\u2019s products are not mate\n    rial absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statisti\n    cally significant risk that the product is causing the events\u2014would\n    \u201cartificially exclud[e]\u201d information that \u201cwould otherwise be consid\n    ered significant to [a reasonable investor\u2019s] trading decision.\u201d Ibid.\n    Matrixx\u2019s premise that statistical significance is the only reliable in\n    dication of causation is flawed. Both medical experts and the Food\n    and Drug Administration rely on evidence other than statistically\n    significant data to establish an inference of causation. It thus stands\n    to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence. Be\n    cause adverse reports can take many forms, assessing their material\n    ity is a fact-specific inquiry, requiring consideration of their source,\n    content, and context. The question is whether a reasonable investor\n    would have viewed the nondisclosed information \u201c \u2018as having signifi\n    cantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information made available.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n    232. Something more than the mere existence of adverse event re\n    ports is needed to satisfy that standard, but that something more is\n    not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source,\n    content, and context of the reports. Pp. 9\u201316.\n         (2) Applying Basic\u2019s \u201ctotal mix\u201d standard here, respondents ade\n    quately pleaded materiality.

Matrixx contends\nthat respondents\u2019 complaint does not adequately allege\nthat Matrixx made a material representation or omission\nor that it acted with scienter because the complaint does\nnot allege that Matrixx knew of a statistically significant\nnumber of adverse events requiring disclosure. We con\u00ad\nclude that the materiality of adverse event reports cannot\n2         MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbe reduced to a bright-line rule. Although in many cases\nreasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse\nevents to be material information, respondents have al\u00ad\nleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors\nwould have viewed these particular reports as material.\nRespondents have also alleged facts \u201cgiving rise to a\nstrong inference\u201d that Matrixx \u201cacted with the required\nstate of mind.\u201d 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011\nSupp.). We therefore hold, in agreement with the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, that respondents have\nstated a claim under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Through a wholly owned subsidiary, Matrixx develops,\nmanufactures, and markets over-the-counter pharmaceu\u00ad\ntical products. Its core brand of products is called Zicam.\nAll of the products sold under the name Zicam are used to\ntreat the common cold and associated symptoms. At the\ntime of the events in question, one of Matrixx\u2019s products\nwas Zicam Cold Remedy, which came in several forms\nincluding nasal spray and gel. The active ingredient in\nZicam Cold Remedy was zinc gluconate. Respondents\nallege that Zicam Cold Remedy accounted for approxi\u00ad\nmately 70 percent of Matrixx\u2019s sales.\n   Respondents initiated this securities fraud class action\nagainst Matrixx on behalf of individuals who purchased\nMatrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and Febru\u00ad\nary 6, 2004.1 The action principally arises out of state\u00ad\nments that Matrixx made during the class period relating\nto revenues and product safety. Respondents claim that\nMatrixx\u2019s statements were misleading in light of reports\nthat Matrixx had received, but did not disclose, about\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 According to the complaint, Matrixx securities were traded on the\n\nNASDAQ National Market.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 14).\n  In 1999, Dr. Alan Hirsch, neurological director of the\nSmell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, Ltd.,\ncalled Matrixx\u2019s customer service line after discovering a\npossible link between Zicam nasal gel and a loss of smell\n\u201cin a cluster of his patients.\u201d App. 67a\u201368a. Dr. Hirsch\ntold a Matrixx employee that \u201cprevious studies had dem\u00ad\nonstrated that intranasal application of zinc could be\nproblematic.\u201d Id., at 68a. He also told the employee about\nat least one of his patients who did not have a cold and\nwho developed anosmia after using Zicam.\n  In September 2002, Timothy Clarot, Matrixx\u2019s vice\npresident for research and development, called Miriam\nLinschoten, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado Health\nSciences Center after receiving a complaint from a per\u00ad\nson Linschoten was treating who had lost her sense of\nsmell after using Zicam. Clarot informed Linschoten that\nMatrixx had received similar complaints from other cus\u00ad\ntomers. Linschoten drew Clarot\u2019s attention to \u201cprevious\nstudies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.\u201d Ibid. Clarot\ngave her the impression that he had not heard of the\nstudies. She asked Clarot whether Matrixx had done any\nstudies of its own; he responded that it had not but that it\nhad hired a consultant to review the product. Soon there\u00ad\nafter, Linschoten sent Clarot abstracts of the studies she\nhad mentioned. Research from the 1930\u2019s and 1980\u2019s had\nconfirmed \u201c[z]inc\u2019s toxicity.\u201d Id., at 69a. Clarot called\nLinschoten to ask whether she would be willing to partici\u00ad\npate in animal studies that Matrixx was planning, but she\ndeclined because her focus was human research.\n  By September 2003, one of Linschoten\u2019s colleagues at\n4          MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe University of Colorado, Dr. Bruce Jafek, had observed\n10 patients suffering from anosmia after Zicam use.\nLinschoten and Jafek planned to present their findings at\na meeting of the American Rhinologic Society in a poster\npresentation entitled \u201cZicam\u00ae Induced Anosmia.\u201d Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The American Rhi\u00ad\nnologic Society posted their abstract in advance of the\nmeeting. The presentation described in detail a 55-year\u00ad\nold man with previously normal taste and smell who\nexperienced severe burning in his nose, followed immedi\u00ad\nately by a loss of smell, after using Zicam. It also reported\n10 other Zicam users with similar symptoms.\n   Matrixx learned of the doctors\u2019 planned presentation.\nClarot sent a letter to Dr. Jafek warning him that he did\nnot have permission to use Matrixx\u2019s name or the names\nof its products. Dr. Jafek deleted the references to Zicam\nin the poster before presenting it to the American Rhi\u00ad\nnologic Society.\n   The following month, two plaintiffs commenced a prod\u00ad\nuct liability lawsuit against Matrixx alleging that Zicam\nhad damaged their sense of smell. By the end of the class\nperiod on February 6, 2004, nine plaintiffs had filed four\nlawsuits.\n   Respondents allege that Matrixx made a series of public\nstatements that were misleading in light of the foregoing\ninformation. In October 2003, after they had learned of\nDr. Jafek\u2019s study and after Dr. Jafek had presented his\nfindings to the American Rhinologic Society, Matrixx\nstated that Zicam was \u201c \u2018poised for growth in the upcoming\ncough and cold season\u2019 \u201d and that the company had \u201c \u2018very\nstrong momentum.\u2019 \u201d2 Id., at 72a\u201374a.

In\nJanuary 2004, Matrixx raised its revenue guidance, pre\u00ad\ndicting an increase in revenues of 80 percent and earnings\nper share in the 33-to-38-cent range.\n   In its Form 10\u2013Q filed with the SEC in November 2003,\nZicam warned of the potential \u201c \u2018material adverse effect\u2019 \u201d\nthat could result from product liability claims, \u201c \u2018whether\nor not proven to be valid.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 75a\u201376a.

It did not disclose,\nhowever, that two plaintiffs had already sued Matrixx for\nallegedly causing them to lose their sense of smell.\n   On January 30, 2004, Dow Jones Newswires reported\nthat the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was \u201c \u2018look\u00ad\ning into complaints that an over-the-counter common-cold\nmedicine manufactured by a unit of Matrixx Initiatives,\nInc.

Matrixx\u2019s stock fell from $13.55 to\n$11.97 per share after the report. In response, on Febru\u00ad\nary 2, Matrixx issued a press release that stated:\n       \u201cAll Zicam products are manufactured and mar\u00ad\n     keted according to FDA guidelines for homeopathic\n     medicine. Our primary concern is the health and\n     safety of our customers and the distribution of fac-\n     tual information about our products. Matrixx believes\n     statements alleging that intranasal Zicam products\n     caused anosmia (loss of smell) are completely un\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Respondents    also allege that Matrixx falsely reported its financial\nresults in the Form 10\u2013Q by failing to reserve for or disclose potential\nliability, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The\nCourt of Appeals did not rely on these allegations.\n6        MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v.

Rather,\n    the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treat\u00ad\n    ment of symptoms related to the common cold have\n    been well established in two double-blind, placebo\u00ad\n    controlled, randomized clinical trials. In fact, in nei\u00ad\n    ther study were there any reports of anosmia related\n    to the use of this compound. The overall incidence of\n    adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was ex\u00ad\n    tremely low, with no statistically significant difference\n    between the adverse event rates for the treated and\n    placebo subsets.\n      \u201cA multitude of environmental and biologic influ\u00ad\n    ences are known to affect the sense of smell. Chief\n    among them is the common cold. As a result, the\n    population most likely to use cold remedy products is\n    already at increased risk of developing anosmia.\n    Other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include\n    age, nasal and sinus infections, head trauma, ana\u00ad\n    tomical obstructions, and environmental irritants.\u201d\n    Id., at 77a\u201378a (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe day after Matrixx issued this press release, its stock\nprice bounced back to $13.40 per share.\n  On February 6, 2004, the end of the class period, Good\nMorning America, a nationally broadcast morning news\nprogram, highlighted Dr. Jafek\u2019s findings. (The complaint\ndoes not allege that Matrixx learned of the news story\nbefore its broadcast.) The program reported that Dr. Jafek\nhad discovered more than a dozen patients suffering from\nanosmia after using Zicam. It also noted that four law\u00ad\nsuits had been filed against Matrixx.

A few weeks later, a reporter quoted Matrixx as\nstating that it would begin conducting \u201c \u2018animal and hu\u00ad\nman studies to further characterize these post-marketing\ncomplaints.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 84a.\n   On the basis of these allegations, respondents claimed\nthat Matrixx violated \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange\nAct and SEC Rule 10b\u20135 by making untrue statements of\nfact and failing to disclose material facts necessary to\nmake the statements not misleading in an effort to main\u00ad\ntain artificially high prices for Matrixx securities.\n                              B\n   Matrixx moved to dismiss respondents\u2019 complaint, argu\u00ad\ning that they had failed to plead the elements of a mate\u00ad\nrial misstatement or omission and scienter. The District\nCourt granted the motion to dismiss. Relying on In re\nCarter-Wallace, Inc., Securities Litigation, 220 F. 3d 36\n(CA2 2000), it held that respondents had not alleged a\n\u201cstatistically significant correlation between the use of\nZicam and anosmia so as to make failure to public[ly]\ndisclose complaints and the University of Colorado study a\nmaterial omission.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a.

See Brief for\nPetitioners 44\u201345, n. 22.7 We note that courts frequently\npermit expert testimony on causation based on evidence\nother than statistical significance. See, e.g., Best v.

Adverse event reports\nare daily events in the pharmaceutical industry; in\n2009, the FDA entered nearly 500,000 such reports into\nits reporting system, see FDA, Reports Received and\nReports Entered in AERS by Year (as of Mar. 31, 2010),\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory\nInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070434.\nhtm. The fact that a user of a drug has suffered an\nadverse event, standing alone, does not mean that\nthe drug caused that event.

For the reasons just stated, the mere existence of\nreports of adverse events\u2014which says nothing in and of\nitself about whether the drug is causing the adverse\nevents\u2014will not satisfy this standard. Something more is\nneeded, but that something more is not limited to statisti\u00ad\ncal significance and can come from \u201cthe source, content,\nand context of the reports,\u201d supra, at 15.

Assuming the complaint\u2019s\nallegations to be true, as we must, Matrixx received in\u00ad\nformation that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link\nbetween Zicam and anosmia. That information included\nreports from three medical professionals and researchers\nabout more than 10 patients who had lost their sense of\nsmell after using Zicam. Clarot told Linschoten that\nMatrixx had received additional reports of anosmia. (In\naddition, during the class period, nine plaintiffs com\u00ad\nmenced four product liability lawsuits against Matrixx\nalleging a causal link between Zicam use and anosmia.)11\nFurther, Matrixx knew that Linschoten and Dr. Jafek had\npresented their findings about a causal link between\nZicam and anosmia to a national medical conference de\u00ad\nvoted to treatment of diseases of the nose.12 Their presen\u00ad\ntation described a patient who experienced severe burning\nin his nose, followed immediately by a loss of smell, after\nusing Zicam\u2014suggesting a temporal relationship between\nZicam use and anosmia.\n  Critically, both Dr. Hirsch and Linschoten had also\ndrawn Matrixx\u2019s attention to previous studies that had\ndemonstrated a biological causal link between intranasal\napplication of zinc and anosmia.13 Before his conversation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 It is unclear whether these plaintiffs were the same individuals\nwhose symptoms were reported by the medical professionals.\n  12 Matrixx contends that Dr. Jafek and Linschoten\u2019s study was not\n\nreliable because they did not sufficiently rule out the common cold as a\ncause for their patients\u2019 anosmia. We note that the complaint alleges\nthat, in one instance, a consumer who did not have a cold lost his sense\nof smell after using Zicam. More importantly, to survive a motion to\ndismiss, respondents need only allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU. S. 544, 570 (2007). For all the reasons we state in the opinion,\nrespondents\u2019 allegations plausibly suggest that Dr. Jafek and Linscho\u00ad\nten\u2019s conclusions were based on reliable evidence of a causal link\nbetween Zicam and anosmia.\n  13 Matrixx contends that these studies are not reliable evidence of\n18         MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v. SIRACUSANO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Linschoten, Clarot, Matrixx\u2019s vice president of re\u00ad\nsearch and development, was seemingly unaware of these\nstudies, and the complaint suggests that, as of the class\nperiod, Matrixx had not conducted any research of its own\nrelating to anosmia. See, e.g., App. 84a (referencing a\npress report, issued after the end of the class period, not\u00ad\ning that Matrixx said it would begin conducting \u201c \u2018animal\nand human studies to further characterize these post\u00ad\nmarketing complaints\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, it can reasonably\nbe inferred from the complaint that Matrixx had no basis\nfor rejecting Dr. Jafek\u2019s findings out of hand.\n   We believe that these allegations suffice to \u201craise a\nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u201d\nsatisfying the materiality requirement, Bell Atlantic Corp.\nv.

S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The information provided to Matrixx\nby medical experts revealed a plausible causal relation\u00ad\nship between Zicam Cold Remedy and anosmia. Consum\u00ad\ners likely would have viewed the risk associated with\nZicam (possible loss of smell) as substantially outweighing\nthe benefit of using the product (alleviating cold symp\u00ad\ntoms), particularly in light of the existence of many alter\u00ad\nnative products on the market. Importantly, Zicam Cold\nRemedy allegedly accounted for 70 percent of Matrixx\u2019s\nsales. Viewing the allegations of the complaint as a whole,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncausation because the studies used zinc sulfate, whereas the active\ningredient in Matrixx is zinc gluconate.

Matrixx further contends that studies relating to fish cannot\nreliably prove causation with respect to humans. The complaint\nreferences several studies, however, only one of which involved fish. In\nany event, the existence of the studies suggests a plausible biological\nlink between zinc and anosmia, which, in combination with the other\nallegations, is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming the\ncomplaint\u2019s allegations to be true, however, Matrixx had\ninformation indicating a significant risk to its leading\nrevenue-generating product. Matrixx also stated that\nreports indicating that Zicam caused anosmia were \u201c \u2018com\u00ad\npletely unfounded and misleading\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the safety\nand efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symp\u00ad\ntoms related to the common cold have been well estab\u00ad\nlished.\u2019 \u201d App. 77a\u201378a. Importantly, however, Matrixx\nhad evidence of a biological link between Zicam\u2019s key\ningredient and anosmia, and it had not conducted any\nstudies of its own to disprove that link. In fact, as Matrixx\nlater revealed, the scientific evidence at that time was\n\u201c \u2018insufficient . . . to determine if zinc gluconate, when used\nas recommended, affects a person\u2019s ability to smell.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 82a.\n    Assuming the facts to be true, these were material facts\n\u201cnecessary in order to make the statements made, in the\nlight of the circumstances under which they were made,\nnot misleading.\u201d 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b).

Matrixx\u2019s pro\u00ad\nposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical\nsignificance to establish a strong inference of scienter is\njust as flawed as its approach to materiality.\n   The inference that Matrixx acted recklessly (or inten\u00ad\ntionally, for that matter) is at least as compelling, if not\nmore compelling, than the inference that it simply thought\nthe reports did not indicate anything meaningful about\nadverse reactions. According to the complaint, Matrixx\nwas sufficiently concerned about the information it re\u00ad\nceived that it informed Linschoten that it had hired a\nconsultant to review the product, asked Linschoten to\nparticipate in animal studies, and convened a panel of\nphysicians and scientists in response to Dr. Jafek\u2019s pres\u00ad\nentation. It successfully prevented Dr. Jafek from using\nZicam\u2019s name in his presentation on the ground that he\nneeded Matrixx\u2019s permission to do so. Most significantly,\nMatrixx issued a press release that suggested that studies\nhad confirmed that Zicam does not cause anosmia when,\nin fact, it had not conducted any studies relating to anos\u00ad\nmia and the scientific evidence at that time, according to\nthe panel of scientists, was insufficient to determine\nwhether Zicam did or did not cause anosmia.15\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 One of Matrixx\u2019s amici argues that \u201cthe most cogent inference re\u00ad\n\ngarding Matrixx\u2019s state of mind is that it delayed releasing information\nregarding anosmia complaints in order to provide itself an opportunity\nto carefully review all evidence regarding any link between Zicam and\nanosmia.\u201d Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae\n26. We do not doubt that this may be the most cogent inference in some\ncases. Here, however, the misleading nature of Matrixx\u2019s press release\nis sufficient to render the inference of scienter at least as compelling as\nthe inference suggested by amicus.\n22       MATRIXX INITIATIVES, INC. v.

S., at\n323, 324. \u201c[A] reasonable person\u201d would deem the infer\u00ad\nence that Matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness (or\neven intent) \u201cat least as compelling as any opposing infer\u00ad\nence one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d Id., at 324.\nWe conclude, in agreement with the Court of Appeals, that\nrespondents have adequately pleaded scienter. Whether\nrespondents can ultimately prove their allegations and\nestablish scienter is an altogether different question.\n                       *    *    *\n For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is\n                                            Affirmed.\n</pre>",
