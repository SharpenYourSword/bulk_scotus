SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                    PLASTICS CORP. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u2013834.      Argued October 13, 2010\u2014Decided March 22, 2011\nPetitioner Kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former\n  employer, respondent (Saint-Gobain), under the Fair Labor Stan\n  dards Act of 1938 (Act), which provides minimum wage, maximum\n  hour, and overtime pay rules; and which forbids employers \u201cto dis\n  charge . . . any employee because such employee has filed any com\n  plaint\u201d alleging a violation of the Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3). In a re\n  lated suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the\n  Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from\n  receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing work\n  related protective gear. In this suit Kasten claims that he was dis\n  charged because he orally complained to company officials about the\n  timeclocks. The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary\n  judgment, concluding that the Act\u2019s antiretaliation provision did not\n  cover oral complaints. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The scope of statutory term \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d includes oral, as\n well as written, complaints. Pp. 4\u201315.\n    (a) The interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201cdepends upon read\n ing the whole statutory text, considering the [statute\u2019s] purpose and\n context . . . , and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform\n the analysis.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486. The text,\n taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer here. Some diction\n ary definitions of \u201cfiled\u201d contemplate a writing while others permit\n using \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral material. In addition to diction\n ary definitions, state statutes and federal regulations sometimes con\n template oral filings, and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that\n oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Act\u2019s pas\n sage. Even if \u201cfiled,\u201d considered alone, might suggest a narrow inter\n2             KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                          PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                             Syllabus \n\n\n    pretation limited to writings, \u201cany complaint\u201d suggests a broad inter\n    pretation that would include an oral complaint. Thus, the three-word\n    phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question. The\n    Act\u2019s other references to \u201cfiled\u201d also do not resolve the linguistic ques\n    tion. Some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually\n    always in writing; others specifically require a writing, and the re\n    mainder, like the provision here, leave the oral/written question un\n    resolved. Since \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d lends itself linguistically to the\n    broader, \u201coral\u201d interpretation, the use of broader language in other\n    statutes\u2019 antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether Con\n    gress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.\n    Because the text, taken alone, might, or might not, encompass oral\n    complaints, the Court must look further. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) Several functional considerations indicate that Congress in\n    tended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written,\n    complaints. Pp. 8\u201314.\n         (1) A narrow interpretation would undermine the Act\u2019s basic ob\n    jective, which is to prohibit \u201clabor conditions detrimental to the\n    maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,\n    efficiency, and general well-being of workers,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7202(a).\n    The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on \u201cinfor\n    mation and complaints received from employees,\u201d Mitchell v. Robert\n    DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292, and its antiretaliation pro\n    vision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing \u201cfear of\n    economic retaliation\u201d from inducing workers \u201cquietly to accept sub\n    standard conditions,\u201d ibid. Why would Congress want to limit the en\n    forcement scheme\u2019s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\u2019s com\n    plaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their\n    complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or\n    overworked workers who were most in need of the Act\u2019s help at the\n    time of passage? Limiting the provision\u2019s scope to written complaints\n    could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews,\n    and other oral methods to receive complaints. And insofar as the\n    provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading\n    would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to\n    secure compliance with the Act. The National Labor Relations Act\u2019s\n    antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting\n    workers who simply \u201cparticipate[d] in a [National Labor Relations]\n    Board investigation.\u201d NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123. The\n    similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad\n    interpretation of \u201ccomplaint.\u201d The Act\u2019s requirement that an em\n    ployer receive fair notice of an employee\u2019s complaint can be met by\n    oral, as well as written, complaints. Pp. 8\u201312.\n         (2) Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal admin\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  istrative agencies, their views about the meaning of the phrase\n  should be given a degree of weight. The Secretary of Labor has con\n  sistently held the view that \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d covers both oral and\n  written complaints. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commis\n  sion has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in mul\n  tiple briefs. These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.\n  And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect\n  careful consideration, not \u201cpost hoc rationalizatio[n].\u201d Motor Vehicle\n  Mfrs.

Pp. 12\u201313.\n        (3) After engaging in traditional statutory interpretation meth\n  ods, the statute does not remain sufficiently ambiguous to warrant\n  application of the rule of lenity. Pp. 13\u201314.\n     (c) This Court will not consider Saint-Gobain\u2019s alternative claim\n  that the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed\n  with the Government, since that claim was not raised in the certio\n  rari briefs and since its resolution is not a \u201c \u2018predicate to an intelli\n  gent resolution\u2019 \u201d of the oral/written question at issue, Caterpillar\n  Inc. v.

S. C. \u00a7201 et\nseq. The Act contains an antiretaliation provision that\nforbids employers\n    \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate\n    against any employee because such employee has filed\n    any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted\n    any proceeding under or related to [the Act], or has\n    testified or is about to testify in such proceeding, or\n    has served or is about to serve on an industry commit\u00ad\n    tee.\u201d \u00a7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nWe must decide whether the statutory term \u201cfiled any\ncomplaint\u201d includes oral as well as written complaints\nwithin its scope. We conclude that it does.\n                            I\n   The petitioner, Kevin Kasten, brought this antiretalia\u00ad\ntion lawsuit against his former employer, Saint-Gobain\nPerformance Plastics Corporation.     Kasten says that\n2         KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSaint-Gobain located its timeclocks between the area\nwhere Kasten and other workers put on (and take off)\ntheir work-related protective gear and the area where they\ncarry out their assigned tasks. That location prevented\nworkers from receiving credit for the time they spent\nputting on and taking off their work clothes\u2014contrary to\nthe Act\u2019s requirements. In a related suit the District\nCourt agreed with Kasten, finding that Saint-Gobain\u2019s\n\u201cpractice of not compensating . . . for time spent donning\nand doffing certain required protective gear and walking\nto work areas\u201d violated the Act. Kasten v. Saint-Gobain\nPerformance Plastics Corp., 556 F. Supp. 2d 941, 954 (WD\nWis. 2008). In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retalia\u00ad\ntion. He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because\nhe orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the\ntimeclocks.\n    In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the\nunlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain\u2019s attention\u2014\nin accordance with Saint-Gobain\u2019s internal grievance\u00ad\nresolution procedure. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting\nSaint-Gobain\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as\nimposing upon every employee \u201cthe responsibility to report\n. . . suspected violations of . . . any applicable law of which\nhe or she becomes aware\u201d); id., at 4\u20135 (quoting Saint-\nGobain\u2019s Employee Policy Handbook as instructing em\u00ad\nployees with \u201cquestions, complaints, and problems\u201d to\n\u201c[c]ontact\u201d their \u201csupervisor[s] immediately\u201d and if neces\u00ad\nsary \u201ctake the issue to the next level of management,\u201d\nthen to the \u201clocal Human Resources Manager,\u201d then to\n\u201cHuman Resources\u201d personnel at the \u201cRegional\u201d or \u201cHead\u00ad\nquarters\u201d level).\n    Kasten adds that he \u201craised a concern\u201d with his shift\nsupervisor that \u201cit was illegal for the time clocks to be\nwhere they were\u201d because of Saint-Gobain\u2019s exclusion of\n\u201cthe time you come in and start doing stuff\u201d; he told a\nhuman resources employee that \u201cif they were to get chal\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Record in No. 3:07\u2013cv\u201300686\u2013bbc (WD Wis.), Doc.\n87\u20133, pp. 31\u201334 (deposition of Kevin Kasten). This activ\u00ad\nity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him\nand, in December 2006, to dismiss him.\n   Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It\ndenies that Kasten made any significant complaint about\nthe timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Kas\u00ad\nten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned,\nfailed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.\n   For present purposes we accept Kasten\u2019s version of\nthese contested events as valid. See Scott v. Harris, 550\nU. S. 372, 380 (2007). That is because the District Court\nentered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain\u2019s favor. 619\nF. Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008). And it did so, not\nbecause it doubted Kasten\u2019s ability to prove the facts he\nalleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect oral\ncomplaints. Id., at 611\u2013613. On appeal, the Seventh\nCircuit agreed with the District Court that the Act\u2019s an\u00ad\ntiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570\nF. 3d 834, 838\u2013840 (2009).\n   Kasten sought certiorari. And in light of conflict among\nthe Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected,\nwe granted Kasten\u2019s petition. Compare Hagan v. Echostar\nSatellite, L. L. C., 529 F. 3d 617, 625\u2013626 (CA5 2008)\n(antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints); Lambert\nv. Ackerley, 180 F. 3d 997, 1007 (CA9 1999) (en banc)\n(same); with Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, 10 F. 3d 46, 55\u2013\n56 (CA2 1993) (antiretaliation provision does not cover\ninformal complaints to supervisors).

Maxey\u2019s\nYamaha, Inc., 513 F. 2d 179, 181 (CA8 1975) (same).\n                             II\n   The sole question presented is whether \u201can oral com\u00ad\nplaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act\u201d is\n\u201cprotected conduct under the [Act\u2019s] anti-retaliation provi\u00ad\nsion.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. The Act protects employees who\nhave \u201cfiled any complaint,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3), and\ninterpretation of this phrase \u201cdepends upon reading the\nwhole statutory text, considering the purpose and context\nof the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori\u00ad\nties that inform the analysis,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU. S. 481, 486 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude\nthat the language of the provision, considered in isolation,\nmay be open to competing interpretations. But consider\u00ad\ning the provision in conjunction with the purpose and\ncontext leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is\npermissible.\n                               A\n   We begin with the text of the statute. The word \u201cfiled\u201d\nhas different relevant meanings in different contexts.\nSome dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a\nwriting. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to \u201cdeliver (a paper or\ninstrument) to the proper officer so that it is received by\nhim to be kept on file, or among the records of his office\u201d\n(emphasis added)); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dic\u00ad\ntionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of \u201cfile\u201d is \u201cto\nplace among official records as prescribed by law\u201d).\n   But other dictionaries provide different definitions that\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermit the use of the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral\nmaterial. One can, for example, file an oral statement\nthat enters a matter \u201cinto the order of business.\u201d 1 Funk\n& Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to \u201cpresent\nin the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so\nthat it shall go upon the records or into the order of busi\u00ad\nness\u201d). This possibility is significant because it means\nthat dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not\nnecessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to writ\u00ad\nten complaints. Cf. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government\nof Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 5) (looking for the \u201climits\u201d of a linguistic\nphrase rather than what \u201cexemplif[ies]\u201d its application).\n   In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found\nthat legislators, administrators, and judges have all some\u00ad\ntimes used the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral state\u00ad\nments. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral\nfilings. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. \u00a747.32.090(a) (2008) (\u201cfile a\nverbal or written complaint\u201d); Cal.

S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nApp. 1925) (\u201cfiled oral pleadings\u201d).\n   Filings may more often be made in writing. See, e.g.,\nRitter v. United States, 28 F. 2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928)\n(finding words \u201cfile a claim for refund\u201d to require a written\nrequest in context of tax code). But we are interested in\nthe filing of \u201cany complaint.\u201d So even if the word \u201cfiled,\u201d\nconsidered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation\nlimited to writings, the phrase \u201cany complaint\u201d suggests a\nbroad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.\nSee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 7). The upshot is that the three-word\nphrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive\nquestion.\n   We can look further to other appearances of the word\n\u201cfiled\u201d in the Act. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 226\n(1994) (examining \u201ccontextual indications\u201d of the meaning\nof a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous\nother provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act\ndoes not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of\nthose other provisions (1) involve filed material that,\nunlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in\nwriting. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(l) (employers must\n\u201chave on file an unexpired certificate\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a7210(a) (Secretary must \u201cfile in the court the record of\nthe industry committee\u201d (emphasis added)); ibid. (industry\ncommittee must \u201cfile\u201d its findings and recommendations).\nOthers (2) specifically require a writing, see, e.g.,\n\u00a7214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee\u2019s \u201cconsent in writing\u201d to\njoin collective action to be \u201cfiled\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a7216(b) (same). And the remainder (3) leave the oral/\nwritten question unresolved\u2014just as does the provision\nbefore us. See, e.g., \u00a7210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless\nmovant \u201cfile[s] in court an undertaking\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); \u00a7214(c)(5)(A) (employee \u201cmay file . . . a petition\u201d\nfor review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).\n8         KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that\ncontain antiretaliation provisions. Those statutes, how\u00ad\never, use somewhat different language.              See, e.g.,\n\u00a7158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has \u201cfiled charges\nor given testimony\u201d); \u00a7623(d) (protecting those who\n\u201copposed any [unlawful] practice\u201d (emphasis added));\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20133(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a72615(a)(2) (similar). See also, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a72087(a)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III) (\u201cprovided . . . to the employer . . .\ninformation relating to any violation\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a72651(a) (similar); 30 U. S. C. \u00a7815(c)(1) (\u201cfiled or made a\ncomplaint\u201d (emphasis added)); 42 U. S. C. \u00a75851(a)(1)(A)\n(\u201cnotified his employer\u201d (emphasis added)); 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a742121(a)(1) (\u201cprovided . . . information\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); \u00a760129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is\nbroader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that\nthe phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the\nbroader, \u201coral\u201d interpretation, the use of broader language\nelsewhere may mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the\nscope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Con\u00ad\ngress did not believe the different phraseology made a\nsignificant difference in this respect. The language alone\ndoes not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect\norally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not\nintend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.\n  The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot\nprovide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.\nThe phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d might, or might not,\nencompass oral complaints. We must look further.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Several functional considerations indicate that Congress\nintended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well\nas written, \u201ccomplaint[s].\u201d First, an interpretation that\nlimited the provision\u2019s coverage to written complaints\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould undermine the Act\u2019s basic objectives. The Act seeks\nto prohibit \u201clabor conditions detrimental to the mainte\u00ad\nnance of the minimum standard of living necessary for\nhealth, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7202(a). It does so in part by setting forth sub\u00ad\nstantive wage, hour, and overtime standards. It relies for\nenforcement of these standards, not upon \u201ccontinuing\ndetailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,\u201d but\nupon \u201cinformation and complaints received from employ\u00ad\nees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been de\u00ad\nnied.\u201d Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S.\n288, 292 (1960). And its antiretaliation provision makes\nthis enforcement scheme effective by preventing \u201cfear of\neconomic retaliation\u201d from inducing workers \u201cquietly to\naccept substandard conditions.\u201d Ibid.\n   Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement\nscheme\u2019s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to\nreduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate,\nless educated, or overworked workers? President Franklin\nRoosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the\nworkers most in need of the Act\u2019s help. See Message to\nCongress, May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of \u201cthose who\ntoil in factory\u201d).\n   In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy\nrates were particularly high among the poor. See E.\nGordon & E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one\u00ad\nquarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept. of\nCommerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the\nUnited States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample\nStatistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8%\nof manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years\nof schooling). Those rates remained high in certain indus\u00ad\ntries for many years after the Act\u2019s passage. In 1948, for\nexample, the National War Labor Board wrote:\n10        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     \u201cIn many plants where there is a high degree of illit\u00ad\n     eracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a\n     substantial hardship. In other plants where there is\n     considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it\n     is often not practicable to write up grievances during\n     work hours.\u201d 1 The Termination Report of the Na\u00ad\n     tional War Labor Board, p. 122.\n   To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the\nfiling of written complaints would also take needed flexi\u00ad\nbility from those charged with the Act\u2019s enforcement. It\ncould prevent Government agencies from using hotlines,\ninterviews, and other oral methods of receiving com\u00ad\nplaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision cov\u00ad\ners complaints made to employers (a matter we need not\ndecide, see infra, at 14\u201315), it would discourage the use of\ndesirable informal workplace grievance procedures to\nsecure compliance with the Act. Cf. Burlington Industries,\nInc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII\nto encourage the development of effective grievance proce\u00ad\ndures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, & K.\nRogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38\u201340\n(1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten\ncomplaints).\n   Given the need for effective enforcement of the National\nLabor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly inter\u00ad\npreted the language of the NLRA\u2019s antiretaliation provi\u00ad\nsion\u2014\u201cfiled charges or given testimony,\u201d 29 U.

Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123\n(1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs\nof this related statute argue for an interpretation of the\nword \u201ccomplaint\u201d that would provide \u201cbroad rather than\nnarrow protection to the employee,\u201d id., at 122 (and would\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndo so here without pressing statutory language to its\nlimit). See also Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda\nLocal No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 597 (1944) (the Act\u2019s \u201creme\u00ad\ndial and humanitarian . . . purpose\u201d cautions against\n\u201cnarrow, grudging\u201d interpretations of its language).\n   Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the\nonly relevant statutory objective. The Act also seeks to\nestablish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.\nTo do so, the employer must have fair notice that an em\u00ad\nployee is making a complaint that could subject the em\u00ad\nployer to a later claim of retaliation. If oral complaints\nsuffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left\nin a state of uncertainty about whether an employee (par\u00ad\nticularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the\nmoment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act viola\u00ad\ntion or just letting off steam.\n   We agree with Saint-Gobain that the statute requires\nfair notice. Although the dictionary definitions, statutes,\nregulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see su\npra, at 4\u20137, do not distinguish between writings and oral\nstatements, they do suggest that a \u201cfiling\u201d is a serious\noccasion, rather than a triviality. As such, the phrase\n\u201cfiled any complaint\u201d contemplates some degree of formal\u00ad\nity, certainly to the point where the recipient has been\ngiven fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and\ndoes, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part\nof its business concerns.\n   Moreover, the statute prohibits employers from dis\u00ad\ncriminating against an employee \u201cbecause such employee\nhas filed any complaint.\u201d \u00a7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nAnd it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or\nshould not) know an employee has made a complaint could\ndiscriminate because of that complaint. But we also be\u00ad\nlieve that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily\nmean that notice must be in writing.\n   At oral argument, the Government said that a complaint\n12        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nis \u201cfiled\u201d when \u201ca reasonable, objective person would have\nunderstood the employee\u201d to have \u201cput the employer on\nnotice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights\nunder the [Act].\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To\nfall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a\ncomplaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a\nreasonable employer to understand it, in light of both\ncontent and context, as an assertion of rights protected by\nthe statute and a call for their protection. This standard\ncan be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by\nwritten ones.\n                              2\n  Second, given Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement pow\u00ad\ners to federal administrative agencies, we also give a\ndegree of weight to their views about the meaning of this\nenforcement language. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(c) (vesting\nenforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization\nPlan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. \u00a71, p. 664 (transferring\nto Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nenforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its\nEqual Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); Skidmore v.\nSwift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a\npersuasive articulation of views within an agency\u2019s area of\nexpertise).\n  The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view\nthat the words \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d cover oral, as well as\nwritten, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated\nthat view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,\nGoldberg v. Zenger, 43 CCH LC \u00b631,155, pp. 40,985,\n40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed\nthat view in briefs. See, e.g., Brief for Secretary of Labor\nas Amicus Curiae Supporting Petition for Rehearing with\nSuggestion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley,\nNo. 96\u201336017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6\u20137. And more recently it\nhas acted in accordance with that view by creating a hot\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Assn. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983). And they consequently add force\nto our conclusion. Skidmore, supra, at 140; cf. United\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 234\u2013235 (2001)\n(Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in\nabsence of rulemaking authority); Babbitt v.

It leads us to favor a more lenient interpre\u00ad\n14        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntation of a criminal statute \u201cwhen, after consulting tradi\u00ad\ntional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an\nambiguous statute.\u201d United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.\n10, 17 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that those who\nviolate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject\nto criminal sanction, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(a). And we have\nsaid that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with\ncriminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.\nSee Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8 (2004). But\nafter engaging in traditional methods of statutory inter\u00ad\npretation, we cannot find that the statute remains suffi\u00ad\nciently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of\nlenity here.\n                                C\n   Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail\nbecause Kasten complained to a private employer, not to\nthe Government; and, in Saint-Gobain\u2019s view, the antire\u00ad\ntaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with\nthe Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the\nlower courts, which held to the contrary. 570 F. 3d, at\n837\u2013838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said\nnothing about it in response to Kasten\u2019s petition for certio\u00ad\nrari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court\nuntil it filed its brief on the merits.\n   We do not normally consider a separate legal question\nnot raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2; Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13\n(1996). We see no reason to make an exception here.\nResolution of the Government/private employer question\nis not a \u201c \u2018 \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution\u201d \u2019 \u201d of the\noral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide.\nSee ibid. (quoting Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38\n(1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written\nquestion separately\u2014on its own. And we have done so.\nThus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3), covers only written complaints to the\nemployer. I would affirm the judgment on the ground that\n\u00a7215(a)(3) does not cover complaints to the employer at all.\n                           I\n  The FLSA\u2019s retaliation provision states that it shall be\nunlawful\n    \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate\n    against any employee because such employee has filed\n    any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted\n    any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has\n    testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,\n    or has served or is about to serve on an industry com\n    mittee.\u201d Ibid.\nThe phrase central to the outcome here is \u201cfiled any com\nplaint.\u201d In the courts below, Kasten asserted a claim for\nretaliation based solely on allegations that he \u201cfiled\u201d oral\n\u201ccomplaints\u201d with his employer; Saint-Gobain argued that\nthe retaliation provision protects only complaints that are\n(1) in writing, and (2) made to judicial or administrative\n2         KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nbodies. I agree with at least the second part of Saint-\nGobain\u2019s contention. The plain meaning of the critical\nphrase and the context in which appears make clear that\nthe retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance\nfiled with a court or an agency, not oral complaints\u2014or\neven formal, written complaints\u2014from an employee to an\nemployer.\n                                A\n   In isolation, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d could cover Kasten\u2019s\nobjection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting\nany \u201c[e]xpression of grief, regret, pain . . . or resentment.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934)\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s). But at the time the FLSA was\npassed (and still today) the word when used in a legal\ncontext has borne a specialized meaning: \u201c[a] formal alle\ngation or charge against a party, made or presented to the\nappropriate court or officer.\u201d Ibid. See also Cambridge\nDictionary of American English 172 (2000) (\u201ca formal\nstatement to a government authority that you have a legal\ncause to complain about the way you have been treated\u201d);\n3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a] state\nment or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial\nauthority . . . for purposes of prosecution or of redress\u201d).\n   There are several reasons to think that the word bears\nits specialized meaning here. First, every other use of the\nword \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the FLSA refers to an official filing\nwith a governmental body. Sections 216(b) and (c) both\nstate that the right to bring particular types of actions\n\u201cshall terminate upon the filing of a complaint\u201d by the\nSecretary of Labor, and \u00a7216(c) clarifies that the statute of\nlimitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid\nwages \u201con the date when the complaint is filed.\u201d These\nprovisions unquestionably use \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the narrow\nlegal sense. Identical words used in different parts of a\nstatute are presumed to have the same meaning absent\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary indication, IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34\n(2005); Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990). It\nis one thing to expand the meaning of \u201ccomplaint\u201d in\n\u00a7215(a)(3) to include complaints filed with an agency\ninstead of a court; it is quite something else to wrench it\nfrom the legal context entirely, to include an employee\u2019s\nobjection to an employer.\n   Second, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d appears as part of the\nphrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and thus draws meaning\nfrom the verb with which it is connected. The choice of the\nword \u201cfiled\u201d rather than a broader alternative like \u201cmade,\u201d\nif it does not connote (as the Seventh Circuit believed,\nand as I need not consider) something in writing, at least\nsuggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action\nand inconsistent (at least in the less regulated work envi\nronment of 1938) with employee-to-employer complaints.\nIt is noteworthy that every definition of the verb \u201cfiled\u201d\nthat the Court\u2019s opinion provides, whether it supports the\ninclusion of oral content or not, envisions a formal, pre\nscribed process of delivery or submission. Ante, at 4\u20135\n(comparing, for example, Webster\u2019s 945 (to file is to \u201cde\nliver (a paper or instrument) to the proper officer\u201d) with 1\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (to file is to \u201cpresent in the\nregular way, as to a judicial or legislative body\u201d)).\n   Moreover, \u201c[t]he law uses familiar legal expressions in\ntheir familiar legal sense,\u201d Henry v. United States, 251\nU. S. 393, 395 (1920). It is, I suppose, possible to speak of\n\u201cfiling a complaint\u201d with an employer, but that is assur\nedly not common usage. Thus, when the antiretaliation\nprovision of the Mine Health and Safety Act used that\nphrase in a context that includes both complaints to an\nagency and complaints to the employer, it did not use\n\u201cfiled\u201d alone, but supplemented that with \u201cor made\u201d\u2014and\nto boot specified \u201cincluding a complaint notifying the\n[mine] operator . . . of an alleged danger or safety or health\n4           KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                        PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nviolation . . . .\u201d 30 U. S. C. \u00a7815(c)(1).1\n   Third, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d appears along\nside three other protected activities: \u201cinstitut[ing] or\ncaus[ing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related\nto this chapter,\u201d \u201ctestif[ying] in any such proceeding,\u201d and\n\u201cserv[ing] . . . on an industry committee.\u201d2 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7215(a)(3). Since each of these three activities involves\nan interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly\nattribute this characteristic to the phrase \u201cfiled any com\nplaint\u201d as well. \u201cThat several items in a list share an\nattribute counsel in favor of interpreting the other items\nas possessing that attribute as well.\u201d Beecham v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994).\n   And finally, the 1938 version of the FLSA, while creat\ning private rights of action for other employer violations,\nsee \u00a716(b), 52 Stat. 1069, did not create a private right of\naction for retaliation. That was added in 1977, see \u00a710, 91\nStat. 1252. Until then, only the Administrator of the\nWage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor could\nenforce the retaliation provision. See \u00a711(a), 52 Stat.\n1066. It would seem more strange to require the employee\nto go to the Administrator to establish, and punish retalia\ntion for, his intracompany complaint, than to require the\nAdministrator-protected complaint to be filed with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Kasten and this Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 7, argue that the use of the\n\nmodifier \u201cany\u201d in the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d suggests that Con\ngress meant to define the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d expansively. Not so. The\nmodifier \u201cany\u201d does not cause a word that is in context narrow to\nbecome broad. The phrase \u201cto cash a check at any bank\u201d does not refer\nto a river bank, or even a blood bank.\n  2 Section 5 of the original FLSA, which has since been repealed,\n\ncharged industry committees with recommending minimum wages for\ncertain industries to the Department of Labor. 52 Stat. 1062. In order\nto perform this function, industry committees were empowered, among\nother things, to \u201chear . . . witnesses\u201d and \u201creceive . . . evidence.\u201d \u00a78(b),\nid., at 1064.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

Never\ntheless, Kasten argues that protecting intracompany\ncomplaints best accords with the purpose of the FLSA\u2014\u201cto\nassure fair compensation to covered employees\u201d\u2014because\nsuch purposes are \u201cadvanced when internal complaints\nlead to voluntary compliance.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n18. But no legislation pursues its ends at all costs. Rodri\nguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per\ncuriam). Congress may not have protected intracompany\ncomplaints for the same reason it did not provide a private\ncause of action for retaliation against complaints: because\nit was unwilling to expose employers to the litigation, or to\nthe inability to dismiss unsatisfactory workers, which that\nadditional step would entail. Limitation of the retaliation\nprovision to agency complaints may have been an attempt\n\u201cto achieve the benefits of regulation right up to the\npoint where the costs of further benefits exceed the value\nof those benefits.\u201d Easterbrook, Statutes\u2019 Domains, 50\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 533, 541 (1983).\n                           2\n  In deciding whether an oral complaint may be \u201cfiled,\u201d\nthe Court\u2019s opinion examines modern state and federal\nstatutes, which presumably cover complaints filed with an\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Kasten argues that excluding intracompany complaints would make\n\nthe phrases \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and \u201cinstituted or caused to be\ninstituted any proceeding\u201d redundant. That is not so. An employee\nmay file a complaint with the Administrator that does not result in a\nproceeding, or has not yet done so when the employer takes its retalia\ntory action.\n6           KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                        PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nemployer. The only relevance of these provisions to\nwhether the FLSA covers such complaints is that none of\nthem achieves that result by use of the term \u201cfiled any\ncomplaint,\u201d and all of them use language that unmistaka\nbly includes complaints to employers. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20133(a) (prohibiting retaliation against employees\nwho \u201coppos[e] any [unlawful] practice\u201d). Any suggestion\nthat because more recent statutes cover intracompany\ncomplaints, a provision adopted in the 1938 Act should be\ndeemed to do so is unacceptable. While the jurisprudence\nof this Court has sometimes sanctioned a \u201cliving Constitu\ntion,\u201d it has never approved a living United States Code.\nWhat Congress enacted in 1938 must be applied according\nto its terms, and not according to what a modern Congress\n(or this Court) would deem desirable.4\n                             3\n  Kasten argues that this Court should defer to the De\npartment of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission\u2019s (EEOC) interpretations of 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7215(a)(3). He claims that those agencies have construed\n\u00a7215(a)(3) to protect intracompany complaints \u201c[f]or al\nmost half a century,\u201d in litigating positions and enforce\nment actions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. He also\nargues that although the Department of Labor lacks the\nauthority to issue regulations implementing \u00a7215(a)(3), it\nhas such authority for several similarly worded provisions\nand has interpreted those statutes to include intracom\npany complaints. Id., at 20.\n  Even were \u00a7215(a)(3) ambiguous, deference would still\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Moreover, if the substance of the retaliation provision of any other\n\nAct could shed light upon what Congress sought to achieve in the\nFLSA, it would be the relatively contemporaneous provision of the\nNational Labor Relations Act, \u00a78(4), 49 Stat. 453, codified at 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7158(a)(4), which did not cover retaliation for employee-employer\ncomplaints. See NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117 (1972).\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbe unwarranted. If we are to apply our new jurisprudence\nthat deference is appropriate only when Congress has\ngiven the agency authority to make rules carrying the\nforce of law, see Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 255\u2013\n256 (2006), deference is improper here. The EEOC has\nno such authority. Although the Secretary of Labor and\nhis subordinates have authority to issue regulations\nunder various provisions of the FLSA, see, e.g., \u00a7203(l);\n\u00a7206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regula\ntions interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to\nissue regulations interpreting \u00a7215(a)(3).\n    Presumably for this reason, the Court\u2019s opinion seems to\nsuggest that only so-called Skidmore deference is appro\npriate, see Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140\n(1944).5 This doctrine states that agencies\u2019 views are\n\u201c \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 \u201d to the extent they have \u201c \u2018the power\nto persuade.\u2019 \u201d Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S.\n576, 587 (2000) (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140).6 For\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Or  perhaps not. The actual quantum of deference measured out by\nthe Court\u2019s opinion is unclear\u2014seemingly intentionally so. The Court\nsays that it is giving \u201ca degree of weight\u201d to the Secretary and EEOC\u2019s\nviews \u201cgiven Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement powers to federal\nadministrative agencies.\u201d Ante, at 12. But it never explicitly states the\nlevel of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of United\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), along with a parenthetical\nsaying that \u201csometimes . . . judicial deference [is] intended even in [the]\nabsence of rulemaking authority.\u201d Ante, at 13. I say this is mysterious\nbecause Mead clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for\nfull Chevron deference, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). I have chosen to interpret\nthe Court as referring to Skidmore deference, rather than Chevron\ndeference or something in-between, in order to minimize the Court\u2019s\nongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law. See\nMead, supra, at 245 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   6 In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both\n\nlinguistically and practically. To defer is to subordinate one\u2019s own\njudgment to another\u2019s. If one has been persuaded by another, so that\none\u2019s judgment accords with the other\u2019s, there is no room for deferral\u2014\nonly for agreement.

Citing this Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2 and Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13\n(1996), the opinion says that this Court does \u201cnot normally\nconsider a separate legal question not raised in the certio\nrari briefs.\u201d Ante, at 15.\n   It regularly does so, however, under the circumstances\nthat obtain here. (Curiously enough, Caterpillar, the case\ncited by the Court, was one instance.) Rule 15.2 is per\nmissive rather than mandatory: \u201cAny objection to consid\neration of a question presented based on what occurred in\nthe proceedings below . . . may be deemed waived unless\ncalled to the Court\u2019s attention in the brief in opposition.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Court has often per\nmitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised\nin the brief in opposition when doing so is \u201cpredicate to an\nintelligent resolution of the question presented, and there\nfore fairly included therein.\u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S.\n33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nVance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258\u2013259, n. 5 (1980).\n   Kasten\u2019s petition for certiorari phrases the question\npresented as follows: \u201cIs an oral complaint of a violation of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the\nanti-retaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3)?\u201d Pet. for\nCert. i. Surely the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d in this question must\nbe assigned an implied addressee.

And the only plausible\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nagency position does nothing but confuse. \n\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

It is not clear what benefit\nadditional briefing would provide.\n   Moreover, whether \u00a7215(a)(3) covers intracompany\ncomplaints is \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the\nquestion presented\u201d in this case. The Court\u2019s own opinion\ndemonstrates the point. While claiming that it remains\nan open question whether intracompany complaints are\ncovered, the opinion adopts a test for \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d\nthat assumes a \u201cyes\u201d answer\u2014and that makes no sense\notherwise. An employee, the Court says, is deemed to\nhave \u201cfiled [a] complaint\u201d only when \u201c \u2018a reasonable, objec\ntive person would have understood the employee\u2019 to have\n\u2018put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting\nstatutory rights under the [Act].\u201d Ante, at 12 (quoting Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 23, 26). This utterly atextual standard is\nobviously designed to counter the argument of Saint-\nGobain, that if oral complaints are allowed, \u201cemployers too\noften will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether\nan employee . . . is in fact making a complaint . . . or just\nletting off steam.\u201d Ante, at 11. Of course, if intracompany\ncomplaints were excluded, this concern would be nonexis\ntent: Filing a complaint with a judicial or administrative\nbody is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of\none\u2019s rights.

Argued October 13, 2010\u2014Decided March 22, 2011\nPetitioner Kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former\n  employer, respondent (Saint-Gobain), under the Fair Labor Stan\n  dards Act of 1938 (Act), which provides minimum wage, maximum\n  hour, and overtime pay rules; and which forbids employers \u201cto dis\n  charge . . . any employee because such employee has filed any com\n  plaint\u201d alleging a violation of the Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3). In a re\n  lated suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the\n  Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from\n  receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing work\n  related protective gear. In this suit Kasten claims that he was dis\n  charged because he orally complained to company officials about the\n  timeclocks. The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary\n  judgment, concluding that the Act\u2019s antiretaliation provision did not\n  cover oral complaints. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The scope of statutory term \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d includes oral, as\n well as written, complaints. Pp. 4\u201315.\n    (a) The interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201cdepends upon read\n ing the whole statutory text, considering the [statute\u2019s] purpose and\n context . . . , and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform\n the analysis.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486. The text,\n taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer here. Some diction\n ary definitions of \u201cfiled\u201d contemplate a writing while others permit\n using \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral material. In addition to diction\n ary definitions, state statutes and federal regulations sometimes con\n template oral filings, and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that\n oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Act\u2019s pas\n sage. Even if \u201cfiled,\u201d considered alone, might suggest a narrow inter\n2             KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                          PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                             Syllabus \n\n\n    pretation limited to writings, \u201cany complaint\u201d suggests a broad inter\n    pretation that would include an oral complaint. Thus, the three-word\n    phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question. The\n    Act\u2019s other references to \u201cfiled\u201d also do not resolve the linguistic ques\n    tion. Some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually\n    always in writing; others specifically require a writing, and the re\n    mainder, like the provision here, leave the oral/written question un\n    resolved. Since \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d lends itself linguistically to the\n    broader, \u201coral\u201d interpretation, the use of broader language in other\n    statutes\u2019 antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether Con\n    gress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.\n    Because the text, taken alone, might, or might not, encompass oral\n    complaints, the Court must look further. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (b) Several functional considerations indicate that Congress in\n    tended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written,\n    complaints. Pp. 8\u201314.\n         (1) A narrow interpretation would undermine the Act\u2019s basic ob\n    jective, which is to prohibit \u201clabor conditions detrimental to the\n    maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,\n    efficiency, and general well-being of workers,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7202(a).\n    The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on \u201cinfor\n    mation and complaints received from employees,\u201d Mitchell v. Robert\n    DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292, and its antiretaliation pro\n    vision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing \u201cfear of\n    economic retaliation\u201d from inducing workers \u201cquietly to accept sub\n    standard conditions,\u201d ibid. Why would Congress want to limit the en\n    forcement scheme\u2019s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\u2019s com\n    plaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their\n    complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or\n    overworked workers who were most in need of the Act\u2019s help at the\n    time of passage? Limiting the provision\u2019s scope to written complaints\n    could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews,\n    and other oral methods to receive complaints. And insofar as the\n    provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading\n    would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to\n    secure compliance with the Act. The National Labor Relations Act\u2019s\n    antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting\n    workers who simply \u201cparticipate[d] in a [National Labor Relations]\n    Board investigation.\u201d NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123. The\n    similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad\n    interpretation of \u201ccomplaint.\u201d The Act\u2019s requirement that an em\n    ployer receive fair notice of an employee\u2019s complaint can be met by\n    oral, as well as written, complaints. Pp. 8\u201312.\n         (2) Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal admin\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The Secretary of Labor has con\n  sistently held the view that \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d covers both oral and\n  written complaints. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commis\n  sion has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in mul\n  tiple briefs. These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.\n  And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect\n  careful consideration, not \u201cpost hoc rationalizatio[n].\u201d Motor Vehicle\n  Mfrs.

S. C. \u00a7201 et\nseq. The Act contains an antiretaliation provision that\nforbids employers\n    \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate\n    against any employee because such employee has filed\n    any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted\n    any proceeding under or related to [the Act], or has\n    testified or is about to testify in such proceeding, or\n    has served or is about to serve on an industry commit\u00ad\n    tee.\u201d \u00a7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nWe must decide whether the statutory term \u201cfiled any\ncomplaint\u201d includes oral as well as written complaints\nwithin its scope. We conclude that it does.\n                            I\n   The petitioner, Kevin Kasten, brought this antiretalia\u00ad\ntion lawsuit against his former employer, Saint-Gobain\nPerformance Plastics Corporation.

That location prevented\nworkers from receiving credit for the time they spent\nputting on and taking off their work clothes\u2014contrary to\nthe Act\u2019s requirements. In a related suit the District\nCourt agreed with Kasten, finding that Saint-Gobain\u2019s\n\u201cpractice of not compensating . . . for time spent donning\nand doffing certain required protective gear and walking\nto work areas\u201d violated the Act.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954 (WD\nWis. 2008). In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retalia\u00ad\ntion. He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because\nhe orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the\ntimeclocks.\n    In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the\nunlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain\u2019s attention\u2014\nin accordance with Saint-Gobain\u2019s internal grievance\u00ad\nresolution procedure.

This activ\u00ad\nity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him\nand, in December 2006, to dismiss him.\n   Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It\ndenies that Kasten made any significant complaint about\nthe timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Kas\u00ad\nten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned,\nfailed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.\n   For present purposes we accept Kasten\u2019s version of\nthese contested events as valid. See Scott v. Harris, 550\nU. S. 372, 380 (2007).

And it did so, not\nbecause it doubted Kasten\u2019s ability to prove the facts he\nalleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect oral\ncomplaints. Id., at 611\u2013613. On appeal, the Seventh\nCircuit agreed with the District Court that the Act\u2019s an\u00ad\ntiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570\nF. 3d 834, 838\u2013840 (2009).\n   Kasten sought certiorari.

The Act protects employees who\nhave \u201cfiled any complaint,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3), and\ninterpretation of this phrase \u201cdepends upon reading the\nwhole statutory text, considering the purpose and context\nof the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori\u00ad\nties that inform the analysis,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU. S. 481, 486 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude\nthat the language of the provision, considered in isolation,\nmay be open to competing interpretations. But consider\u00ad\ning the provision in conjunction with the purpose and\ncontext leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is\npermissible.\n                               A\n   We begin with the text of the statute. The word \u201cfiled\u201d\nhas different relevant meanings in different contexts.\nSome dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a\nwriting. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to \u201cdeliver (a paper or\ninstrument) to the proper officer so that it is received by\nhim to be kept on file, or among the records of his office\u201d\n(emphasis added)); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dic\u00ad\ntionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of \u201cfile\u201d is \u201cto\nplace among official records as prescribed by law\u201d).\n   But other dictionaries provide different definitions that\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermit the use of the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral\nmaterial. One can, for example, file an oral statement\nthat enters a matter \u201cinto the order of business.\u201d 1 Funk\n& Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to \u201cpresent\nin the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so\nthat it shall go upon the records or into the order of busi\u00ad\nness\u201d). This possibility is significant because it means\nthat dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not\nnecessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to writ\u00ad\nten complaints. Cf. Crawford v. Metropolitan Government\nof Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 5) (looking for the \u201climits\u201d of a linguistic\nphrase rather than what \u201cexemplif[ies]\u201d its application).\n   In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found\nthat legislators, administrators, and judges have all some\u00ad\ntimes used the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral state\u00ad\nments. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral\nfilings. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. \u00a747.32.090(a) (2008) (\u201cfile a\nverbal or written complaint\u201d); Cal.

United States, 28 F. 2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928)\n(finding words \u201cfile a claim for refund\u201d to require a written\nrequest in context of tax code). But we are interested in\nthe filing of \u201cany complaint.\u201d So even if the word \u201cfiled,\u201d\nconsidered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation\nlimited to writings, the phrase \u201cany complaint\u201d suggests a\nbroad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.\nSee, e.g., Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 7). The upshot is that the three-word\nphrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive\nquestion.\n   We can look further to other appearances of the word\n\u201cfiled\u201d in the Act. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 226\n(1994) (examining \u201ccontextual indications\u201d of the meaning\nof a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous\nother provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act\ndoes not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of\nthose other provisions (1) involve filed material that,\nunlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in\nwriting. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(l) (employers must\n\u201chave on file an unexpired certificate\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a7210(a) (Secretary must \u201cfile in the court the record of\nthe industry committee\u201d (emphasis added)); ibid. (industry\ncommittee must \u201cfile\u201d its findings and recommendations).\nOthers (2) specifically require a writing, see, e.g.,\n\u00a7214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee\u2019s \u201cconsent in writing\u201d to\njoin collective action to be \u201cfiled\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a7216(b) (same). And the remainder (3) leave the oral/\nwritten question unresolved\u2014just as does the provision\nbefore us. See, e.g., \u00a7210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless\nmovant \u201cfile[s] in court an undertaking\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); \u00a7214(c)(5)(A) (employee \u201cmay file . . . a petition\u201d\nfor review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).\n8         KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that\ncontain antiretaliation provisions. Those statutes, how\u00ad\never, use somewhat different language.              See, e.g.,\n\u00a7158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has \u201cfiled charges\nor given testimony\u201d); \u00a7623(d) (protecting those who\n\u201copposed any [unlawful] practice\u201d (emphasis added));\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20133(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a72615(a)(2) (similar). See also, e.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a72087(a)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III) (\u201cprovided . . . to the employer . . .\ninformation relating to any violation\u201d (emphasis added));\n\u00a72651(a) (similar); 30 U. S. C. \u00a7815(c)(1) (\u201cfiled or made a\ncomplaint\u201d (emphasis added)); 42 U. S. C. \u00a75851(a)(1)(A)\n(\u201cnotified his employer\u201d (emphasis added)); 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a742121(a)(1) (\u201cprovided . . . information\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); \u00a760129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is\nbroader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that\nthe phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the\nbroader, \u201coral\u201d interpretation, the use of broader language\nelsewhere may mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the\nscope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Con\u00ad\ngress did not believe the different phraseology made a\nsignificant difference in this respect. The language alone\ndoes not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect\norally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not\nintend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.\n  The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot\nprovide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.\nThe phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d might, or might not,\nencompass oral complaints. We must look further.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Several functional considerations indicate that Congress\nintended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well\nas written, \u201ccomplaint[s].\u201d First, an interpretation that\nlimited the provision\u2019s coverage to written complaints\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould undermine the Act\u2019s basic objectives. The Act seeks\nto prohibit \u201clabor conditions detrimental to the mainte\u00ad\nnance of the minimum standard of living necessary for\nhealth, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7202(a). It does so in part by setting forth sub\u00ad\nstantive wage, hour, and overtime standards. It relies for\nenforcement of these standards, not upon \u201ccontinuing\ndetailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,\u201d but\nupon \u201cinformation and complaints received from employ\u00ad\nees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been de\u00ad\nnied.\u201d Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S.\n288, 292 (1960). And its antiretaliation provision makes\nthis enforcement scheme effective by preventing \u201cfear of\neconomic retaliation\u201d from inducing workers \u201cquietly to\naccept substandard conditions.\u201d Ibid.\n   Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement\nscheme\u2019s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to\nreduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate,\nless educated, or overworked workers? President Franklin\nRoosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the\nworkers most in need of the Act\u2019s help. See Message to\nCongress, May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of \u201cthose who\ntoil in factory\u201d).\n   In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy\nrates were particularly high among the poor. See E.\nGordon & E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one\u00ad\nquarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept. of\nCommerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the\nUnited States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample\nStatistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8%\nof manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years\nof schooling). Those rates remained high in certain indus\u00ad\ntries for many years after the Act\u2019s passage. In 1948, for\nexample, the National War Labor Board wrote:\n10        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     \u201cIn many plants where there is a high degree of illit\u00ad\n     eracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a\n     substantial hardship. In other plants where there is\n     considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it\n     is often not practicable to write up grievances during\n     work hours.\u201d 1 The Termination Report of the Na\u00ad\n     tional War Labor Board, p. 122.\n   To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the\nfiling of written complaints would also take needed flexi\u00ad\nbility from those charged with the Act\u2019s enforcement. It\ncould prevent Government agencies from using hotlines,\ninterviews, and other oral methods of receiving com\u00ad\nplaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision cov\u00ad\ners complaints made to employers (a matter we need not\ndecide, see infra, at 14\u201315), it would discourage the use of\ndesirable informal workplace grievance procedures to\nsecure compliance with the Act. Cf. Burlington Industries,\nInc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII\nto encourage the development of effective grievance proce\u00ad\ndures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, & K.\nRogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38\u201340\n(1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten\ncomplaints).\n   Given the need for effective enforcement of the National\nLabor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly inter\u00ad\npreted the language of the NLRA\u2019s antiretaliation provi\u00ad\nsion\u2014\u201cfiled charges or given testimony,\u201d 29 U.

Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117, 123\n(1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs\nof this related statute argue for an interpretation of the\nword \u201ccomplaint\u201d that would provide \u201cbroad rather than\nnarrow protection to the employee,\u201d id., at 122 (and would\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndo so here without pressing statutory language to its\nlimit). See also Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda\nLocal No. 123, 321 U. S. 590, 597 (1944) (the Act\u2019s \u201creme\u00ad\ndial and humanitarian . . . purpose\u201d cautions against\n\u201cnarrow, grudging\u201d interpretations of its language).\n   Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the\nonly relevant statutory objective. The Act also seeks to\nestablish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.\nTo do so, the employer must have fair notice that an em\u00ad\nployee is making a complaint that could subject the em\u00ad\nployer to a later claim of retaliation. If oral complaints\nsuffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left\nin a state of uncertainty about whether an employee (par\u00ad\nticularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the\nmoment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act viola\u00ad\ntion or just letting off steam.\n   We agree with Saint-Gobain that the statute requires\nfair notice. Although the dictionary definitions, statutes,\nregulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see su\npra, at 4\u20137, do not distinguish between writings and oral\nstatements, they do suggest that a \u201cfiling\u201d is a serious\noccasion, rather than a triviality. As such, the phrase\n\u201cfiled any complaint\u201d contemplates some degree of formal\u00ad\nity, certainly to the point where the recipient has been\ngiven fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and\ndoes, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part\nof its business concerns.\n   Moreover, the statute prohibits employers from dis\u00ad\ncriminating against an employee \u201cbecause such employee\nhas filed any complaint.\u201d \u00a7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nAnd it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or\nshould not) know an employee has made a complaint could\ndiscriminate because of that complaint. But we also be\u00ad\nlieve that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily\nmean that notice must be in writing.\n   At oral argument, the Government said that a complaint\n12        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nis \u201cfiled\u201d when \u201ca reasonable, objective person would have\nunderstood the employee\u201d to have \u201cput the employer on\nnotice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights\nunder the [Act].\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To\nfall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a\ncomplaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a\nreasonable employer to understand it, in light of both\ncontent and context, as an assertion of rights protected by\nthe statute and a call for their protection. This standard\ncan be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by\nwritten ones.\n                              2\n  Second, given Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement pow\u00ad\ners to federal administrative agencies, we also give a\ndegree of weight to their views about the meaning of this\nenforcement language. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(c) (vesting\nenforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization\nPlan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. \u00a71, p. 664 (transferring\nto Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nenforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its\nEqual Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); Skidmore v.\nSwift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a\npersuasive articulation of views within an agency\u2019s area of\nexpertise).\n  The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view\nthat the words \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d cover oral, as well as\nwritten, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated\nthat view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,\nGoldberg v. Zenger, 43 CCH LC \u00b631,155, pp. 40,985,\n40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed\nthat view in briefs. See, e.g., Brief for Secretary of Labor\nas Amicus Curiae Supporting Petition for Rehearing with\nSuggestion for Rehearing En Banc in Lambert v. Ackerley,\nNo. 96\u201336017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6\u20137. And more recently it\nhas acted in accordance with that view by creating a hot\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Assn. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,\n463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983). And they consequently add force\nto our conclusion. Skidmore, supra, at 140; cf. United\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229, 234\u2013235 (2001)\n(Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in\nabsence of rulemaking authority); Babbitt v.

It leads us to favor a more lenient interpre\u00ad\n14        KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntation of a criminal statute \u201cwhen, after consulting tradi\u00ad\ntional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an\nambiguous statute.\u201d United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.\n10, 17 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that those who\nviolate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject\nto criminal sanction, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(a). And we have\nsaid that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with\ncriminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.\nSee Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11, n. 8 (2004). But\nafter engaging in traditional methods of statutory inter\u00ad\npretation, we cannot find that the statute remains suffi\u00ad\nciently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of\nlenity here.\n                                C\n   Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail\nbecause Kasten complained to a private employer, not to\nthe Government; and, in Saint-Gobain\u2019s view, the antire\u00ad\ntaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with\nthe Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the\nlower courts, which held to the contrary. 570 F. 3d, at\n837\u2013838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said\nnothing about it in response to Kasten\u2019s petition for certio\u00ad\nrari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court\nuntil it filed its brief on the merits.\n   We do not normally consider a separate legal question\nnot raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2; Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13\n(1996). We see no reason to make an exception here.\nResolution of the Government/private employer question\nis not a \u201c \u2018 \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution\u201d \u2019 \u201d of the\noral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide.\nSee ibid. (quoting Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38\n(1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written\nquestion separately\u2014on its own. And we have done so.\nThus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3), covers only written complaints to the\nemployer. I would affirm the judgment on the ground that\n\u00a7215(a)(3) does not cover complaints to the employer at all.\n                           I\n  The FLSA\u2019s retaliation provision states that it shall be\nunlawful\n    \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate\n    against any employee because such employee has filed\n    any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted\n    any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has\n    testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,\n    or has served or is about to serve on an industry com\n    mittee.\u201d Ibid.\nThe phrase central to the outcome here is \u201cfiled any com\nplaint.\u201d In the courts below, Kasten asserted a claim for\nretaliation based solely on allegations that he \u201cfiled\u201d oral\n\u201ccomplaints\u201d with his employer; Saint-Gobain argued that\nthe retaliation provision protects only complaints that are\n(1) in writing, and (2) made to judicial or administrative\n2         KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                      PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nbodies. I agree with at least the second part of Saint-\nGobain\u2019s contention. The plain meaning of the critical\nphrase and the context in which appears make clear that\nthe retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance\nfiled with a court or an agency, not oral complaints\u2014or\neven formal, written complaints\u2014from an employee to an\nemployer.\n                                A\n   In isolation, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d could cover Kasten\u2019s\nobjection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting\nany \u201c[e]xpression of grief, regret, pain . . . or resentment.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934)\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s). But at the time the FLSA was\npassed (and still today) the word when used in a legal\ncontext has borne a specialized meaning: \u201c[a] formal alle\ngation or charge against a party, made or presented to the\nappropriate court or officer.\u201d Ibid. See also Cambridge\nDictionary of American English 172 (2000) (\u201ca formal\nstatement to a government authority that you have a legal\ncause to complain about the way you have been treated\u201d);\n3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a] state\nment or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial\nauthority . . . for purposes of prosecution or of redress\u201d).\n   There are several reasons to think that the word bears\nits specialized meaning here. First, every other use of the\nword \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the FLSA refers to an official filing\nwith a governmental body. Sections 216(b) and (c) both\nstate that the right to bring particular types of actions\n\u201cshall terminate upon the filing of a complaint\u201d by the\nSecretary of Labor, and \u00a7216(c) clarifies that the statute of\nlimitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid\nwages \u201con the date when the complaint is filed.\u201d These\nprovisions unquestionably use \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the narrow\nlegal sense. Identical words used in different parts of a\nstatute are presumed to have the same meaning absent\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary indication, IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34\n(2005); Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990). It\nis one thing to expand the meaning of \u201ccomplaint\u201d in\n\u00a7215(a)(3) to include complaints filed with an agency\ninstead of a court; it is quite something else to wrench it\nfrom the legal context entirely, to include an employee\u2019s\nobjection to an employer.\n   Second, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d appears as part of the\nphrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and thus draws meaning\nfrom the verb with which it is connected. The choice of the\nword \u201cfiled\u201d rather than a broader alternative like \u201cmade,\u201d\nif it does not connote (as the Seventh Circuit believed,\nand as I need not consider) something in writing, at least\nsuggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action\nand inconsistent (at least in the less regulated work envi\nronment of 1938) with employee-to-employer complaints.\nIt is noteworthy that every definition of the verb \u201cfiled\u201d\nthat the Court\u2019s opinion provides, whether it supports the\ninclusion of oral content or not, envisions a formal, pre\nscribed process of delivery or submission. Ante, at 4\u20135\n(comparing, for example, Webster\u2019s 945 (to file is to \u201cde\nliver (a paper or instrument) to the proper officer\u201d) with 1\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (to file is to \u201cpresent in the\nregular way, as to a judicial or legislative body\u201d)).\n   Moreover, \u201c[t]he law uses familiar legal expressions in\ntheir familiar legal sense,\u201d Henry v. United States, 251\nU. S. 393, 395 (1920). It is, I suppose, possible to speak of\n\u201cfiling a complaint\u201d with an employer, but that is assur\nedly not common usage. Thus, when the antiretaliation\nprovision of the Mine Health and Safety Act used that\nphrase in a context that includes both complaints to an\nagency and complaints to the employer, it did not use\n\u201cfiled\u201d alone, but supplemented that with \u201cor made\u201d\u2014and\nto boot specified \u201cincluding a complaint notifying the\n[mine] operator . . . of an alleged danger or safety or health\n4           KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                        PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nviolation . . . .\u201d 30 U. S. C. \u00a7815(c)(1).1\n   Third, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d appears along\nside three other protected activities: \u201cinstitut[ing] or\ncaus[ing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related\nto this chapter,\u201d \u201ctestif[ying] in any such proceeding,\u201d and\n\u201cserv[ing] . . . on an industry committee.\u201d2 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7215(a)(3). Since each of these three activities involves\nan interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly\nattribute this characteristic to the phrase \u201cfiled any com\nplaint\u201d as well. \u201cThat several items in a list share an\nattribute counsel in favor of interpreting the other items\nas possessing that attribute as well.\u201d Beecham v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994).\n   And finally, the 1938 version of the FLSA, while creat\ning private rights of action for other employer violations,\nsee \u00a716(b), 52 Stat. 1069, did not create a private right of\naction for retaliation. That was added in 1977, see \u00a710, 91\nStat. 1252. Until then, only the Administrator of the\nWage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor could\nenforce the retaliation provision. See \u00a711(a), 52 Stat.\n1066. It would seem more strange to require the employee\nto go to the Administrator to establish, and punish retalia\ntion for, his intracompany complaint, than to require the\nAdministrator-protected complaint to be filed with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Kasten and this Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 7, argue that the use of the\n\nmodifier \u201cany\u201d in the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d suggests that Con\ngress meant to define the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d expansively. Not so. The\nmodifier \u201cany\u201d does not cause a word that is in context narrow to\nbecome broad. The phrase \u201cto cash a check at any bank\u201d does not refer\nto a river bank, or even a blood bank.\n  2 Section 5 of the original FLSA, which has since been repealed,\n\ncharged industry committees with recommending minimum wages for\ncertain industries to the Department of Labor. 52 Stat. 1062. In order\nto perform this function, industry committees were empowered, among\nother things, to \u201chear . . . witnesses\u201d and \u201creceive . . . evidence.\u201d \u00a78(b),\nid., at 1064.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  5\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nAdministrator in the first place.3\n                              B\n                              1\n   The meaning of the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d is clear\nin light of its context, and there is accordingly no need\nto rely on abstractions of congressional purpose. Never\ntheless, Kasten argues that protecting intracompany\ncomplaints best accords with the purpose of the FLSA\u2014\u201cto\nassure fair compensation to covered employees\u201d\u2014because\nsuch purposes are \u201cadvanced when internal complaints\nlead to voluntary compliance.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n18. But no legislation pursues its ends at all costs. Rodri\nguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per\ncuriam). Congress may not have protected intracompany\ncomplaints for the same reason it did not provide a private\ncause of action for retaliation against complaints: because\nit was unwilling to expose employers to the litigation, or to\nthe inability to dismiss unsatisfactory workers, which that\nadditional step would entail. Limitation of the retaliation\nprovision to agency complaints may have been an attempt\n\u201cto achieve the benefits of regulation right up to the\npoint where the costs of further benefits exceed the value\nof those benefits.\u201d Easterbrook, Statutes\u2019 Domains, 50\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 533, 541 (1983).\n                           2\n  In deciding whether an oral complaint may be \u201cfiled,\u201d\nthe Court\u2019s opinion examines modern state and federal\nstatutes, which presumably cover complaints filed with an\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Kasten argues that excluding intracompany complaints would make\n\nthe phrases \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and \u201cinstituted or caused to be\ninstituted any proceeding\u201d redundant. That is not so. An employee\nmay file a complaint with the Administrator that does not result in a\nproceeding, or has not yet done so when the employer takes its retalia\ntory action.\n6           KASTEN v. SAINT-GOBAIN PERFORMANCE \n\n                        PLASTICS CORP.\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nemployer. The only relevance of these provisions to\nwhether the FLSA covers such complaints is that none of\nthem achieves that result by use of the term \u201cfiled any\ncomplaint,\u201d and all of them use language that unmistaka\nbly includes complaints to employers. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20133(a) (prohibiting retaliation against employees\nwho \u201coppos[e] any [unlawful] practice\u201d). Any suggestion\nthat because more recent statutes cover intracompany\ncomplaints, a provision adopted in the 1938 Act should be\ndeemed to do so is unacceptable. While the jurisprudence\nof this Court has sometimes sanctioned a \u201cliving Constitu\ntion,\u201d it has never approved a living United States Code.\nWhat Congress enacted in 1938 must be applied according\nto its terms, and not according to what a modern Congress\n(or this Court) would deem desirable.4\n                             3\n  Kasten argues that this Court should defer to the De\npartment of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission\u2019s (EEOC) interpretations of 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7215(a)(3). He claims that those agencies have construed\n\u00a7215(a)(3) to protect intracompany complaints \u201c[f]or al\nmost half a century,\u201d in litigating positions and enforce\nment actions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. He also\nargues that although the Department of Labor lacks the\nauthority to issue regulations implementing \u00a7215(a)(3), it\nhas such authority for several similarly worded provisions\nand has interpreted those statutes to include intracom\npany complaints. Id., at 20.\n  Even were \u00a7215(a)(3) ambiguous, deference would still\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Moreover, if the substance of the retaliation provision of any other\n\nAct could shed light upon what Congress sought to achieve in the\nFLSA, it would be the relatively contemporaneous provision of the\nNational Labor Relations Act, \u00a78(4), 49 Stat. 453, codified at 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7158(a)(4), which did not cover retaliation for employee-employer\ncomplaints. See NLRB v. Scrivener, 405 U. S. 117 (1972).\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbe unwarranted. If we are to apply our new jurisprudence\nthat deference is appropriate only when Congress has\ngiven the agency authority to make rules carrying the\nforce of law, see Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 255\u2013\n256 (2006), deference is improper here. The EEOC has\nno such authority. Although the Secretary of Labor and\nhis subordinates have authority to issue regulations\nunder various provisions of the FLSA, see, e.g., \u00a7203(l);\n\u00a7206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regula\ntions interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to\nissue regulations interpreting \u00a7215(a)(3).\n    Presumably for this reason, the Court\u2019s opinion seems to\nsuggest that only so-called Skidmore deference is appro\npriate, see Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140\n(1944).5 This doctrine states that agencies\u2019 views are\n\u201c \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 \u201d to the extent they have \u201c \u2018the power\nto persuade.\u2019 \u201d Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S.\n576, 587 (2000) (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140).6 For\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Or  perhaps not. The actual quantum of deference measured out by\nthe Court\u2019s opinion is unclear\u2014seemingly intentionally so. The Court\nsays that it is giving \u201ca degree of weight\u201d to the Secretary and EEOC\u2019s\nviews \u201cgiven Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement powers to federal\nadministrative agencies.\u201d Ante, at 12. But it never explicitly states the\nlevel of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of United\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), along with a parenthetical\nsaying that \u201csometimes . . . judicial deference [is] intended even in [the]\nabsence of rulemaking authority.\u201d Ante, at 13. I say this is mysterious\nbecause Mead clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for\nfull Chevron deference, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). I have chosen to interpret\nthe Court as referring to Skidmore deference, rather than Chevron\ndeference or something in-between, in order to minimize the Court\u2019s\nongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law. See\nMead, supra, at 245 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   6 In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both\n\nlinguistically and practically. To defer is to subordinate one\u2019s own\njudgment to another\u2019s. If one has been persuaded by another, so that\none\u2019s judgment accords with the other\u2019s, there is no room for deferral\u2014\nonly for agreement.

Citing this Court\u2019s Rule\n15.2 and Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13\n(1996), the opinion says that this Court does \u201cnot normally\nconsider a separate legal question not raised in the certio\nrari briefs.\u201d Ante, at 15.\n   It regularly does so, however, under the circumstances\nthat obtain here. (Curiously enough, Caterpillar, the case\ncited by the Court, was one instance.) Rule 15.2 is per\nmissive rather than mandatory: \u201cAny objection to consid\neration of a question presented based on what occurred in\nthe proceedings below . . . may be deemed waived unless\ncalled to the Court\u2019s attention in the brief in opposition.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Court has often per\nmitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised\nin the brief in opposition when doing so is \u201cpredicate to an\nintelligent resolution of the question presented, and there\nfore fairly included therein.\u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S.\n33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nVance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258\u2013259, n. 5 (1980).\n   Kasten\u2019s petition for certiorari phrases the question\npresented as follows: \u201cIs an oral complaint of a violation of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the\nanti-retaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7215(a)(3)?\u201d Pet. for\nCert. i. Surely the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d in this question must\nbe assigned an implied addressee. It presumably does not\ninclude a complaint to Judge Judy. And the only plausible\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nagency position does nothing but confuse. \n\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

It is not clear what benefit\nadditional briefing would provide.\n   Moreover, whether \u00a7215(a)(3) covers intracompany\ncomplaints is \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the\nquestion presented\u201d in this case. The Court\u2019s own opinion\ndemonstrates the point. While claiming that it remains\nan open question whether intracompany complaints are\ncovered, the opinion adopts a test for \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d\nthat assumes a \u201cyes\u201d answer\u2014and that makes no sense\notherwise. An employee, the Court says, is deemed to\nhave \u201cfiled [a] complaint\u201d only when \u201c \u2018a reasonable, objec\ntive person would have understood the employee\u2019 to have\n\u2018put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting\nstatutory rights under the [Act].\u201d Ante, at 12 (quoting Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 23, 26). This utterly atextual standard is\nobviously designed to counter the argument of Saint-\nGobain, that if oral complaints are allowed, \u201cemployers too\noften will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether\nan employee . . . is in fact making a complaint . . . or just\nletting off steam.\u201d Ante, at 11. Of course, if intracompany\ncomplaints were excluded, this concern would be nonexis\ntent: Filing a complaint with a judicial or administrative\nbody is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of\none\u2019s rights.
