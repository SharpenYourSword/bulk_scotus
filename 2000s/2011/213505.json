Argued October 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 29, 2011\nPetitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office concedes that,\n  in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery,\n  prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to\n  disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction,\n  Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was\n  convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report\n  was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and\n  Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He\n  then filed suit against the district attorney\u2019s office under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the\n  office\u2019s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors\n  to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that,\n  to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a\n  pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that\n  the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attor\n  ney\u2019s office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson dam\n  ages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.\nHeld: A district attorney\u2019s office may not be held liable under \u00a71983 for\n  failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation. Pp.\n  6\u201320.\n     (a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose \u00a71983 liability on local governments\n  must prove that their injury was caused by \u201caction pursuant to offi\n  cial municipal policy,\u201d which includes the decisions of a government\u2019s\n  lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so\n  persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\n  Monell v.

Har\n    ris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context re\n    quires proof that city policymakers disregarded the \u201cknown or obvi\n    ous consequence\u201d that a particular omission in their training\n    program would cause city employees to violate citizens\u2019 constitutional\n    rights. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.\n    Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained em\n    ployees is \u201cordinarily necessary\u201d to demonstrate deliberate indiffer\n    ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of\n    training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have delib\n    erately chosen a training program that will cause violations of consti\n    tutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern\n    of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for\n    dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial\n    could not have put the district attorney\u2019s office on notice of the need\n    for specific training. Pp. 9\u201310.\n       (c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the \u201csingle-incident\u201d liability\n    hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his\n    case was the \u201cobvious\u201d consequence of failing to provide specific\n    Brady training and that this \u201cobviousness\u201d showing can substitute\n    for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish munici\n    pal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed\n    its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing\n    felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on\n    the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city\u2019s de\n    liberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely,\n    violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in\n    their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Can\n    ton\u2019s hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\n    cific legal training present in Canton\u2019s scenario\u2014police academy ap\n    plicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on\n    deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge\u2014is\n    absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\n    tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitu\n    tional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training be\n    fore entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing educa\n    tion requirements, often train on the job with more experienced\n    attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical\n    obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically\n    bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations\n  are not the \u201cobvious consequence\u201d of failing to provide prosecutors\n  with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary\n  training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.\n  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.\n  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with\n  constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but\n  must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady\n  evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.\n  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate\n  indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow\n  that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif\n  ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing\n  to train them amounts, as it must, to \u201ca decision by the city itself to\n  violate the Constitution.\u201d Canton, 489 U.

CONNICK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ET AL., \n\n      PETITIONERS v. JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office now con\ncedes that, in prosecuting respondent John Thompson for\nattempted armed robbery, prosecutors failed to disclose\nevidence that should have been turned over to the defense\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Thompson\nwas convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson\nelected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial\nfor murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent\n18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One\nmonth before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, his inves\ntigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his\narmed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that\nthe evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson\u2019s\nconvictions were vacated.\n   After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner\nHarry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans\nParish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat.\n\u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Thompson alleged that Connick\nhad failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their\nduty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of\n2                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson\u2019s rob\nbery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million,\nand the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by\nan evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to\ndecide whether a district attorney\u2019s office may be held\nliable under \u00a71983 for failure to train based on a single\nBrady violation. We hold that it cannot.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the\nmurder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Pub\nlicity following the murder charge led the victims of an\nunrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their\nattacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with\nattempted armed robbery.\n   As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene\ntechnician took from one of the victims\u2019 pants a swatch of\nfabric stained with the robber\u2019s blood. Approximately one\nweek before Thompson\u2019s armed robbery trial, the swatch\nwas sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the\ntrial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received\nthe crime lab\u2019s report, which stated that the perpetrator\nhad blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecu\ntors ever had Thompson\u2019s blood tested or that they knew\nwhat his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the\nreport on assistant district attorney James Williams\u2019 desk,\nbut Williams denied seeing it. The report was never dis\nclosed to Thompson\u2019s counsel.\n   Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant\ndistrict attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial,\nDeegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out\nof the police property room, including the blood-stained\nswatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the\nswatch into the courthouse property room. The prosecu\ntors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial, and the jury convicted Thompson of attempted\narmed robbery.\n   A few weeks later, Williams and special prosecutor Eric\nDubelier tried Thompson for the Liuzza murder. Because\nof the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to\ntestify in his own defense. He was convicted and sen\ntenced to death. State v. Thompson, 516 So. 2d 349 (La.\n1987). In the 14 years following Thompson\u2019s murder\nconviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied\nhis challenges to the conviction and sentence. See State ex\nrel. Thompson v. Cain, 95\u20132463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So. 2d\n906; Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802 (CA5 1998). The\nState scheduled Thompson\u2019s execution for May 20, 1999.\n   In late April 1999, Thompson\u2019s private investigator\ndiscovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery\ninvestigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime\nLaboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have\nblood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not\nhis. Thompson\u2019s attorneys presented this evidence to the\ndistrict attorney\u2019s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the\nexecution and vacate Thompson\u2019s armed robbery convic\ntion.1 The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed\nThompson\u2019s murder conviction, concluding that the armed\nrobbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson\nof his right to testify in his own defense at the murder\ntrial. State v. Thompson, 2002\u20130361 (La. App. 7/17/02),\n825 So. 2d 552. In 2003, the district attorney\u2019s office\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 After Thompson discovered the crime lab report, former assistant\n\ndistrict attorney Michael Riehlmann revealed that Deegan had con\nfessed to him in 1994 that he had \u201cintentionally suppressed blood\nevidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some\nway exculpated the defendant.\u201d Record EX583; see also id., at 2677.\nDeegan apparently had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer\nwhen he made his confession. Following a disciplinary complaint by\nthe district attorney\u2019s office, the Supreme Court of Louisiana repri\nmanded Riehlmann for failing to disclose Deegan\u2019s admission earlier.\nIn re Riehlmann, 2004\u20130680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nretried Thompson for Liuzza\u2019s murder.2 The jury found\nhim not guilty.\n                               B\n   Thompson then brought this action against the district\nattorney\u2019s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging\nthat their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,\nincarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only\nclaim that proceeded to trial was Thompson\u2019s claim under\n\u00a71983 that the district attorney\u2019s office had violated Brady\nby failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed\nrobbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged\nliability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was\ncaused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor\nney\u2019s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick\u2019s\ndeliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the\nprosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu\ntional violations.\n   Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro\nduce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3\nSee Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that the \u201conly issue\u201d was whether the\nnondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or\ncustom of the district attorney\u2019s office or a deliberately\nindifferent failure to train the office\u2019s prosecutors. Record\n1615.\n   Although no prosecutor remembered any specific train\ning session regarding Brady prior to 1985, it was undis\nputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and pre\n\nsented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.\nThat man, the government\u2019s key witness at the first murder trial, had\ndied in the interval between the first and second trials.\n  3 Because Connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab\n\nreport violated Brady, that question is not presented here, and we do\nnot address it.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngeneral Brady requirement that the State disclose to the\ndefense evidence in its possession that is favorable to\nthe accused. Prosecutors testified that office policy was to\nturn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over\nto the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery\nof the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors\ndisagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under\nBrady absent knowledge of Thompson\u2019s blood type.\n   The jury rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that an unconstitu\ntional office policy caused the Brady violation, but found\nthe district attorney\u2019s office liable for failing to train the\nprosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in\ndamages, and the District Court added more than $1\nmillion in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\n   After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection\u2014which\nhe had raised on summary judgment\u2014that he could not\nhave been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for\nmore or different Brady training because there was no\nevidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar Brady\nviolations. The District Court rejected this argument for\nthe reasons that it had given in the summary judgment\norder. In that order, the court had concluded that a pat\ntern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate\nindifference when the need for training is \u201cso obvious.\u201d\nNo. Civ. A. 03\u20132045 (ED La., Nov. 15, 2005), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13. Relying on Canton\nv. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989), the court had held that\nThompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by\nproving that \u201cthe DA\u2019s office knew to a moral certainty\nthat assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire Brady\nmaterial, that without training it is not always obvious\nwhat Brady requires, and that withholding Brady mate\nrial will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of\nconstitutional rights.\u201d4 App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 The   District Court rejected Connick\u2019s proposed deliberate indiffer\n6                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nWL 3541035, *13.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not\npresent evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,\n553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not\nneed to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the\npanel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on\nnotice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting\nevidence \u201cthat attorneys, often fresh out of law school,\nwould undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues\nwhile at the DA\u2019s Office, that erroneous decisions regard\ning Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional\nviolations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un\nclear, and that training in Brady would have been help\nful.\u201d 553 F. 3d, at 854.\n   The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel\nopinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby\naffirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)\n(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court\ndisputed whether Thompson could establish municipal\nliability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the\nsingle Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make\nthat showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when\none or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp\nson\u2019s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the\ncrime lab report to Thompson\u2019s counsel. Under Thomp\nson\u2019s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving\nboth (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district\nattorney\u2019s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nence jury instruction\u2014which would have required Thompson to prove a\npattern of similar violations\u2014for the same reasons as the summary\njudgment motion.

Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as\na matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he\nwas on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore\ndeliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different\nBrady training. We agree.5\n                             A\n  Title 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 provides in relevant part:\n       \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordi\n     nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . .\n     subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Because  we conclude that Thompson failed to prove deliberate indif\nference, we need not reach causation. Thus, we do not address whether\nthe alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the \u201c \u2018moving\nforce,\u2019 \u201d Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 389 (1989) (quoting Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), and\nPolk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 326 (1981)), that \u201cactually\ncaused\u201d the failure to disclose the crime lab report, Canton, supra, at\n391.\n   The same cannot be said for the dissent, however. Affirming the\nverdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved\ndeliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsur\nprisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,\nwhich would require showing that the failure to provide particular\ntraining (which the dissent never clearly identifies) \u201cactually caused\u201d\nthe flagrant\u2014and quite possibly intentional\u2014misconduct that occurred\nin this case. See post, at 21 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (assuming that,\n\u201c[h]ad Brady\u2019s importance been brought home to prosecutors,\u201d the\nviolation at issue \u201csurely\u201d would not have occurred). The dissent\nbelieves that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly \u201cmisappre\nhen[ded]\u201d Brady proves causation. Post, at 27, n. 20. Of course, if\nevidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that\nthe lack of training \u201cactually caused\u201d the violation at issue, no causa\ntion requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who\nsatisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily\nsatisfy the causation requirement.\n8                  CONNICK v.

Monell, 436\nU. S., at 691; see id., at 694. Official municipal policy\nincludes the decisions of a government\u2019s lawmakers, the\nacts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persis\ntent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\nSee ibid.; Pembaur, supra, at 480\u2013481; Adickes v.

Thus, when city policymakers are on\nactual or constructive notice that a particular omission in\ntheir training program causes city employees to violate\ncitizens\u2019 constitutional rights, the city may be deemed\ndeliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to\nretain that program. Id., at 407. The city\u2019s \u201cpolicy of\ninaction\u201d in light of notice that its program will cause\nconstitutional violations \u201cis the functional equivalent of a\ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\u201d\nCanton, 489 U.

Without notice\nthat a course of training is deficient in a particular re\nspect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliber\nately chosen a training program that will cause violations\nof constitutional rights.\n   Although Thompson does not contend that he proved a\npattern of similar Brady violations, 553 F. 3d, at 851,\nvacated, 578 F. 3d 293 (en banc), he points out that, dur\ning the ten years preceding his armed robbery trial, Lou\nisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of\nBrady violations by prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office.6 Those\nfour reversals could not have put Connick on notice that\nthe office\u2019s Brady training was inadequate with respect to\nthe sort of Brady violation at issue here. None of those\ncases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime\nlab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.\nBecause those incidents are not similar to the violation at\nissue here, they could not have put Connick on notice that\nspecific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional\nviolation.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Thompson    had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a\npattern of similar violations, given that the jury instruction allowed\nthe jury to find deliberate indifference based on, among other things,\nprosecutors\u2019 \u201chistory of mishandling\u201d similar situations. Record 1619.\n   7 Thompson also asserts that this case is not about a \u201csingle incident\u201d\n\nbecause up to four prosecutors may have been responsible for the\nnondisclosure of the crime lab report and, according to his allegations,\nwithheld additional evidence in his armed robbery and murder trials.\nBut contemporaneous or subsequent conduct cannot establish a pattern\nof violations that would provide \u201cnotice to the cit[y] and the opportunity\nto conform to constitutional dictates . . . .\u201d Canton, 489 U.

He contends that\nthe Brady violation in his case was the \u201cobvious\u201d conse\nquence of failing to provide specific Brady training, and\nthat this showing of \u201cobviousness\u201d can substitute for the\npattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability.\n   In Canton, the Court left open the possibility that, \u201cin a\nnarrow range of circumstances,\u201d a pattern of similar viola\ntions might not be necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the\nhypothetical example of a city that arms its police force\nwith firearms and deploys the armed officers into the\npublic to capture fleeing felons without training the offi\ncers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly\nforce. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known\nfrequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing\nfelons and the \u201cpredictability that an officer lacking spe\ncific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens\u2019\nrights,\u201d the Court theorized that a city\u2019s decision not to\ntrain the officers about constitutional limits on the use of\ndeadly force could reflect the city\u2019s deliberate indifference\nto the \u201chighly predictable consequence,\u201d namely, violations\nof constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The\nCourt sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,\nthat the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train\ncould be so patently obvious that a city could be liable\nunder \u00a71983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\nviolations.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, no \n\ncourt has ever found any of the other Brady violations that Thompson\n\nalleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials. \n\n12                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations\ndoes not fall within the narrow range of Canton\u2019s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\ncific legal training that was present in the Canton scenario\nis absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split\nsecond decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is\nno reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of\ndeadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no\nway for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they\nrequire. Under those circumstances there is an obvious\nneed for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal\n\u201c[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average\npublic employees.\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 304\u2013305 (opinion of\nClement, J.).\n   Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\ntools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand\nconstitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before\nthey may enter the profession and receive a law license,\nall attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a\nsubstantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of\njurisdictions must do both. See, e.g., La. State Bar Assn.\n(LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a737,\nch. 4, App., Art. 14, \u00a77 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended\nthrough 1985). These threshold requirements are de\nsigned to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how\nto find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984) (noting\nthat the presumption \u201cthat the lawyer is competent to\nprovide the guiding hand that the defendant needs\u201d ap\nplies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their\nfirst jury trial and even when the case is complex).\n   Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most\njurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing\neducation requirements. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of In\ncorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCt. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdic\ntions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education\nrequirements mandate that attorneys represent their\nclients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in\ncontinuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule\nProf. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before\nLouisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it\nimposed similar general competency requirements on its\nstate bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1\u2013\n1, 1\u20132, DR 6\u2013101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).\n   Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in\ndistrict attorney\u2019s offices, also train on the job as they\nlearn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here\nin the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, junior\nprosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super\nvised them as they worked together to prepare cases for\ntrial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\nSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in\nstructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of\nrelevant legal developments.\n   In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy\ncharacter and fitness standards to receive a law license\nand are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to\nreinforce the profession\u2019s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 14, \u00a77 (1985); see generally\nid., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).\nTrial lawyers have a \u201cduty to bring to bear such skill and\nknowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial\ntesting process.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,\n688 (1984). Prosecutors have a special \u201cduty to seek jus\ntice, not merely to convict.\u201d LSBA, Articles of Incorpora\ntion, Art. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice 3\u20131.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors\u2019 unique\nethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence\nto the defense. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of Incorporation,\nArt. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct\n14                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n3.8(d) (1984).8 An attorney who violates his or her ethical\nobligations is subject to professional discipline, including\nsanctions, suspension, and disbarment. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 15, \u00a7\u00a75, 6 (1971); id., Art.\n16, DR 1\u2013102; ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4\n(1984).\n  In light of this regime of legal training and professional\nresponsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not\nthe \u201cobvious consequence\u201d of failing to provide prosecutors\nwith formal in-house training about how to obey the law.\nBryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409. Prosecutors are not only\nequipped but are also ethically bound to know what Brady\nentails and to perform legal research when they are uncer\ntain. A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors\u2019\nprofessional training and ethical obligations in the ab\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The   Louisiana State Bar Code of Professional Responsibility in\ncluded a broad understanding of the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose in\n1985:\n\u201cWith respect to evidence and witnesses, the prosecutor has responsi\nbilities different from those of a lawyer in private practice: the prosecu\ntor should make timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence,\nknown to him, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate\nthe degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment. Further, a prose\ncutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because\nhe believes it will damage the prosecution\u2019s case or aid the accused.\u201d\nLSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); see also ABA\nModel Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (\u201cThe prosecutor in a criminal\ncase shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or\ninformation known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of\nthe accused or mitigates the offense . . .\u201d).\n  In addition to these ethical rules, the Louisiana Code of Criminal\nProcedure, with which Louisiana prosecutors are no doubt familiar, in\n1985 required prosecutors, upon order of the court, to permit inspection\nof evidence \u201cfavorable to the defendant . . . which [is] material and\nrelevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,\u201d La.

S., at 391. A licensed attorney making legal judg\nments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about Brady mate\nrial simply does not present the same \u201chighly predictable\u201d\nconstitutional danger as Canton\u2019s untrained officer.\n   A second significant difference between this case and\nthe example in Canton is the nuance of the allegedly\nnecessary training. The Canton hypothetical assumes\nthat the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of\nthe constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it\nis undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office\nwere familiar with the general Brady rule. Thompson\u2019s\ncomplaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an\nability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies\nthe Canton hypothetical, but rather must assert that\nprosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evi\ndence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his\ncase. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an infer\nence of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in\nCanton, \u201c[i]n virtually every instance where a person has\nhad his or her constitutional rights violated by a city\nemployee, a \u00a71983 plaintiff will be able to point to some\nthing the city \u2018could have done\u2019 to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.\u201d 489 U. S., at 392 (citing Tuttle, 471 U. S., at 823\n(plurality opinion)).\n   Thompson suggests that the absence of any formal\ntraining sessions about Brady is equivalent to the com\nplete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, see post, at 31, n. 26 (citing post,\nat 18\u201320), a prosecutor\u2019s youth is not a \u201cspecific reason\u201d not to rely on\nprofessional training and ethical obligations. See supra, at 12 (citing\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984)).\n16                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCanton. But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the\nsubstance of the training, not the particular instructional\nformat. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts\ncarte blanche to micromanage local governments through\nout the United States.\n  We do not assume that prosecutors will always make\ncorrect Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific\nBrady questions would not assist prosecutors. But show\ning merely that additional training would have been\nhelpful in making difficult decisions does not establish\nmunicipal liability. \u201c[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident\ncould have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or\nmore training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particu\nlar injury-causing conduct\u201d will not suffice. Canton, su\npra, at 391. The possibility of single-incident liability that\nthe Court left open in Canton is not this case.10\n                              2\n  The dissent rejects our holding that Canton\u2019s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter,\nencompass failure to train prosecutors in their Brady\nobligation. It would instead apply the Canton hypotheti\ncal to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion\nto explaining why the evidence supports liability under\nthat theory.11 But the dissent\u2019s attempt to address our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by\n\n\u201cdirect evidence of policymaker fault\u201d and so, presumably, did not need\nto rely on circumstantial evidence at all. Brief for Respondent 37. In\nsupport, Thompson contends that Connick created a \u201cculture of indif\nference\u201d in the district attorney\u2019s office, id., at 38, as evidenced by\nConnick\u2019s own allegedly inadequate understanding of Brady, the office\u2019s\nunwritten Brady policy that was later incorporated into a 1987 hand\nbook, and an officewide \u201crestrictive discovery policy,\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 39\u201340. This argument is essentially an assertion that Connick\u2019s\noffice had an unconstitutional policy or custom. The jury rejected this\nclaim, and Thompson does not challenge that finding.\n   11 The dissent spends considerable time finding new Brady violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

See post, at 29\u201330. The reason why the\nCanton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,\nunlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nin Thompson\u2019s trials.

The dissent does not list these violations among the\n\u201c[a]bundant evidence\u201d that it believes supports the jury\u2019s finding that\nBrady training was obviously necessary. Post, at 16. Nor does the\ndissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subse\nquent conduct cannot establish a pattern of violations. The only point\nappears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic, even if\nlegally irrelevant, facts.\n   In any event, the dissent\u2019s findings are highly suspect. In finding two\nof the \u201cnew\u201d violations, the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 1998 decision that those Brady claims were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\nCompare Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806\u2013808 (CA5) (rejecting\nBrady claims regarding the Perkins-Liuzza audiotapes and the Perkins\npolice report), with post, at 8\u20139 (concluding that these were Brady\nviolations). There is no basis to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that materially\nnew facts have called the Court of Appeals\u2019 1998 decision into question.\nCf. State v. Thompson, 2002\u20130361, p. 6 (La.

As our precedent makes clear, proving that a\nmunicipality itself actually caused a constitutional viola\ntion by failing to train the offending employee presents\n\u201cdifficult problems of proof,\u201d and we must adhere to a\n\u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d lest municipal liability under\n\u00a71983 collapse into respondeat superior.12 Bryan County,\n520 U. S., at 406, 410; see Canton, 489 U. S., at 391\u2013392.\n                            3\n  The District Court and the Court of Appeals panel erro\nneously believed that Thompson had proved deliberate\nindifference by showing the \u201cobviousness\u201d of a need for\nadditional training. They based this conclusion on Con\nnick\u2019s awareness that (1) prosecutors would confront\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Although the dissent acknowledges that \u201cdeliberate indifference\n\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same,\u201d the\nopinion suggests that it believes otherwise.

We stand by the longstanding rule\u2014reaffirmed by a unani\nmous Court earlier this Term\u2014that to prove a violation of \u00a71983, a\nplaintiff must prove that \u201cthe municipality\u2019s own wrongful conduct\u201d\ncaused his injury, not that the municipality is ultimately responsible\nfor the torts of its employees.

This is insufficient.\n  It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas\nand some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so\nobviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them\namounts to \u201ca decision by the city itself to violate the\nConstitution.\u201d Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To prove delib\nerate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick\nwas on notice that, absent additional specified training, it\nwas \u201chighly predictable\u201d that the prosecutors in his office\nwould be confounded by those gray areas and make incor\nrect Brady decisions as a result. In fact, Thompson had to\nshow that it was so predictable that failing to train the\nprosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defen\ndants\u2019 Brady rights. See Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409;\nCanton, supra, at 389. He did not do so.\n                              III\n  The role of a prosecutor is to see that justice is done.\nBerger v. United States, 295 U.

By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried\nThompson\u2019s armed robbery case failed to carry out that\nresponsibility. But the only issue before us is whether\nConnick, as the policymaker for the district attorney\u2019s\noffice, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the\nattorneys under his authority.\n  We conclude that this case does not fall within the\n20                 CONNICK v.

I write separately only\nto address several aspects of the dissent.\n  1. The dissent\u2019s lengthy excavation of the trial record is\na puzzling exertion. The question presented for our re\nview is whether a municipality is liable for a single Brady\nviolation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern\nor practice of prior violations put the municipality on\nnotice of a need for specific training that would have pre\nvented it. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\nThat question is a legal one: whether a Brady violation\npresents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized\nin Canton\u2019s footnote 10, in which the need for training in\nconstitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the\nmunicipality\u2019s failure to provide that training amounts\nto deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390, n. 10 (1989).\n  The dissent defers consideration of this question until\npage 23 of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space\nto allegations that Connick\u2019s prosecutors misunderstood\nBrady when asked about it at trial, see post, at 16\u201318\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.), and to supposed gaps in the\nBrady guidance provided by Connick\u2019s office to prosecu\ntors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific Brady\n2                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nviolation at issue in this case) in a policy manual pub\nlished by Connick\u2019s office three years after Thompson\u2019s\ntrial, see post, at 18\u201321. None of that is relevant. Thomp\nson\u2019s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a\npervasive culture of indifference to Brady, but rather on\nthe inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of\ncriminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it\ncould find Connick deliberately indifferent if:\n       \u201cFirst: The District Attorney was certain that prosecu\n       tors would confront the situation where they would\n       have to decide which evidence was required by the\n       constitution to be provided to an accused[;]\n       \u201cSecond: The situation involved a difficult choice, or\n       one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,\n       such that additional training, supervision, or monitor\n       ing was clearly needed[; and]\n       \u201cThird: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that\n       situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an ac\n       cused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d App. 828.\n  That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the\nlaw of Monell1 in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.\nBrady mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error\nroutinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad\nwarrant; losing a Batson2 claim; crossing the line in clos\ning argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Con\nfrontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have \u201cde facto\nrespondeat superior liability,\u201d Canton, 489 U. S., at 392,\nfor each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train\nsimply because the municipality does not have a profes\nsional educational program covering the specific violation\nin sufficient depth.3 Were Thompson\u2019s theory the law,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Monell\n          v.

S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                        SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthere would have been no need for Canton\u2019s footnote to\nconfine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of\narming police officers with guns without telling them\nabout the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing\nfelons; the District Court\u2019s instructions cover every recur\nring situation in which citizens\u2019 rights can be violated.\n   That result cannot be squared with our admonition that\nfailure-to-train liability is available only in \u201climited cir\ncumstances,\u201d id., at 387, and that a pattern of consti\ntutional violations is \u201cordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability and causation,\u201d Board of Comm\u2019rs of\nBryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 409 (1997). These\nrestrictions are indispensable because without them,\n\u201cfailure to train\u201d would become a talismanic incantation\nproducing municipal liability \u201c[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights\nviolated by a city employee\u201d\u2014which is what Monell re\njects. Canton, 489 U. S., at 392. Worse, it would \u201cengage\nthe federal courts in an endless exercise of second\nguessing municipal employee-training programs,\u201d thereby\ndiminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.\nIbid.\n   2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seri\nously contend that Thompson\u2019s theory of recovery was\nproper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that\ntheory at trial. See post, at 25. The accusation is false.\nConnick\u2019s central claim was and is that failure-to-train\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nBrady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in \n\nhis underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or \n\nmonitored regarding the production of Brady evidence.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 25, \n\nn. 17 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends\nentirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to\ntraining in aspects of Brady that have been repeatedly violated, but\nincludes\u2014as the dissent would have it include here\u2014training that\nwould avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at\nall.\n4                       CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nliability for a Brady violation cannot be premised on a\nsingle incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previ\nous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary\njudgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick\noffered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge\neffectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:\n        \u201c[Connick\u2019s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition\n     in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to\n     include language that says that deliberate indiffer\n     ence to training requires a pattern of similar viola\n     tions and proof of deliberate indifference requires\n     more than a single isolated act.\n        \u201c[Thompson\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s not the law, Your\n     Honor.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: No, I\u2019m not giving that. That was in\n     your motion for summary judgment that I denied.\u201d\n     Tr. 1013.\nNothing more is required to preserve a claim of error. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).4\n  3. But in any event, to recover from a municipality\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, a plaintiff must satisfy a \u201crigor\nous\u201d standard of causation, Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 405;\nhe must \u201cdemonstrate a direct causal link between the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent\u2019s contention that \u201c[t]he instruction Connick proposed\n\nresembled the charge given by the District Court,\u201d post, at 25, n. 18,\ndisregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a\npattern of prior violations. It is meaningless to say that after \u201cthe court\nrejected [Connick\u2019s] categorical position,\u201d as it did, he did not \u201cassail the\nDistrict Court\u2019s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,\u201d\npost, at 26, n. 18. The prior-pattern requirement was part of Connick\u2019s\nrequested formulation of deliberate indifference: \u201cTo prove deliberate\nindifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u2018at least a pattern of similar\nviolations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be\nobviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Record, Doc.\n94, p. 18 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmunicipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\u201d\nId., at 404. Thompson cannot meet that standard. The\nwithholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly\ncaused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific train\ning, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan\u2019s willful\nsuppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in\nan effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan\u2019s\ncolleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to\nhim\u2014in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed\nhe had only a few months to live\u2014that he had \u201csuppressed\nblood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thomp\nson that in some way exculpated the defendant.\u201d App.\n367; see also id., at 362 (\u201c[Deegan] told me . . . that he had\nfailed to inform the defense of exculpatory information\u201d). I\nhave no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly\nsince Riehlmann\u2019s testimony hardly paints a flattering\npicture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan\u2019s\nmisconduct for another five years, as a result of which he\nincurred professional sanctions. See In re Riehlmann,\n2004\u20130680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.              And if\nRiehlmann\u2019s story is true, then the \u201cmoving force,\u201d Bryan\nCty., supra, at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbehind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a\nfailure of continuing legal education.\n  4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting\nthat with proper Brady training, \u201csurely at least one\u201d of\nthe prosecutors in Thompson\u2019s trial would have turned\nover the lab report and blood swatch. Post, at 21. But\ntraining must consist of more than mere broad encomiums\nof Brady: We have made clear that \u201cthe identified defi\nciency in a city\u2019s training program [must be] closely re\nlated to the ultimate injury.\u201d Canton, supra, at 391. So\neven indulging the dissent\u2019s assumption that Thompson\u2019s\nprosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith\u2014\nin a way that could be prevented by training\u2014what sort of\n6                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ntraining would have prevented the good-faith nondisclo\nsure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?\n   Perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate\ntraining would have prevented it. The dissent\u2019s sugges\ntion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of\nBrady limiting prosecutors\u2019 disclosure obligations to evi\ndence that is \u201cfavorable to an accused,\u201d 373 U. S., at 87.\nInstead, the dissent proposes that \u201cConnick could have\ncommunicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncer\ntain terms, that, \u2018[i]f you have physical evidence that, if\ntested, can establish the innocence of the person who is\ncharged, you have to turn it over.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 20, n. 13\n(quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training\nsuggestion, the dissent\u2019s proposal is better described as a\nsub silentio expansion of the substantive law of Brady. If\nany of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have\nnever read it, and the dissent does not cite it.5\n   Since Thompson\u2019s trial, however, we have decided a case\nthat appears to say just the opposite of the training the\ndissent would require: In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.\n51, 58 (1988), we held that \u201cunless a criminal defendant\ncan show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\npreserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a\ndenial of due process of law.\u201d We acknowledged that\n\u201cBrady . . . makes the good or bad faith of the State irrele\nvant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant\nmaterial exculpatory evidence,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 What the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an\n\nunexpected source: Connick\u2019s testimony about what qualifies as Brady\nmaterial. See post, at 20\u201321, n. 13. (\u201cOr Connick could have told\nprosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prose\ncutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the pros\necutor does not know the defendant\u2019s blood type: \u2018Under the law, it\nqualifies as Brady material.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the\ndissent has expended persuading us that Connick\u2019s understanding of\nBrady is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on\nthe subject is, to the say the least, surprising.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDue Process Clause requires a different result when we\ndeal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary\nmaterial of which no more can be said than that it could\nhave been subjected to tests, the results of which might\nhave exonerated the defendant.\u201d Id., at 57. Perhaps one\nday we will recognize a distinction between good-faith\nfailures to preserve from destruction evidence whose\ninculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and\ngood-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the de\nfense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to\nobserve that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indif\nference.\n   5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best\nkept secret of this case: There was probably no Brady\nviolation at all\u2014except for Deegan\u2019s (which, since it was a\nbad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attrib\nuted to lack of training).6 The dissent surely knows this,\nwhich is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick\nconceded that Brady was violated. I can honor that con\ncession in my analysis of the case because even if it ex\ntends beyond Deegan\u2019s deliberate actions, it remains\nirrelevant to Connick\u2019s training obligations. For any\nBrady violation apart from Deegan\u2019s was surely on the\nvery frontier of our Brady jurisprudence; Connick could\nnot possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was\nrequired to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to\nuntested evidence that we had not (and still have not)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent\u2019s only response to this is that the jury must have found\n\notherwise, since it was instructed that \u201c \u2018[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).\nBut this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not\ncommit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury\nfrom finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.\nI not only agree with that; it is part of my point.\n8                 CONNICK v.

CONNICK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ET AL., \n\n      PETITIONERS v. JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n  In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), this\nCourt held that due process requires the prosecution to\nturn over evidence favorable to the accused and material\nto his guilt or punishment. That obligation, the parties\nhave stipulated, was dishonored in this case; conse\nquently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of\nthem isolated on death row, before the truth came to light:\nHe was innocent of the charge of attempted armed rob\nbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by\nprosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.\n  The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attor\nney\u2019s Office (District Attorney\u2019s Office or Office) cannot be\nheld liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983,\nfor the grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the\nCourt tells us, because Thompson has shown only an\naberrant Brady violation, not a routine practice of giving\nshort shrift to Brady\u2019s requirements. The evidence pre\nsented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thomp\nson, however, points distinctly away from the Court\u2019s\nassessment. As the trial record in the \u00a71983 action re\nveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial trans\ngressions were neither isolated nor atypical.\n  From the top down, the evidence showed, members of\n2                  CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe District Attorney\u2019s Office, including the District At\ntorney himself, misperceived Brady\u2019s compass and there\nfore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.\nThroughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against\nThompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him\nfor armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and\nthe court exculpatory information Thompson requested\nand had a constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors\ndid so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two\ndecades, to set the record straight. Based on the prosecu\ntors\u2019 conduct relating to Thompson\u2019s trials, a fact trier\ncould reasonably conclude that inattention to Brady was\nstandard operating procedure at the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice.\n   What happened here, the Court\u2019s opinion obscures, was\nno momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone offi\ncer\u2019s misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that\nmisperception and disregard of Brady\u2019s disclosure re\nquirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evi\ndence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately\nindifferent conduct for which the District Attorney\u2019s Office\nbears responsibility under \u00a71983.\n   I dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment mindful that Brady\nviolations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected.\nBut for a chance discovery made by a defense team inves\ntigator weeks before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, the\nevidence that led to his exoneration might have remained\nunder wraps. The prosecutorial concealment Thompson\nencountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless\nmunicipal agencies bear responsibility\u2014made tangible by\n\u00a71983 liability\u2014for adequately conveying what Brady\nrequires and for monitoring staff compliance. Failure to\ntrain, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liabil\nity under \u00a71983 \u201cwhere the failure . . . amounts to deliber\nate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the\n[untrained employees] come into contact.\u201d Canton v.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

That standard is well\nmet in this case.\n                              I\n   I turn first to a contextual account of the Brady viola\ntions that infected Thompson\u2019s trials.\n                              A\n  In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an\nassailant shot and killed Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., son of a\nprominent New Orleans business executive, on the street\nfronting the victim\u2019s home. Only one witness saw the\nassailant. As recorded in two contemporaneous police\nreports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant\nas African-American, six feet tall, with \u201cclose cut hair.\u201d\nRecord EX2\u2013EX3, EX9.1 Thompson is five feet eight\ninches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair\nin a large \u201cAfro.\u201d Id., at EX13. The police reports of the\nwitness\u2019 immediate identification were not disclosed to\nThompson or to the court.\n  While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans\nParish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent\ncrime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an\nassailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.\nDuring the struggle, the perpetrator\u2019s blood stained the\noldest child\u2019s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch\nof fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,\nwas eventually tested. The test conclusively established\nthat the perpetrator\u2019s blood was type B. Id., at EX151.\nThompson\u2019s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to\ndisclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Exhibits entered into evidence in Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983 trial are herein\n\ncited by reference to the page number in the exhibit binder compiled by\nthe District Court and included in the record on appeal.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n  One month after the Liuzza murder, Richard Perkins, a\nman who knew Thompson, approached the Liuzza family.\nPerkins did so after the family\u2019s announcement of a\n$15,000 reward for information leading to the murderer\u2019s\nconviction. Police officers surreptitiously recorded the\nPerkins-Liuzza conversations.2 As documented on tape,\nPerkins told the family, \u201cI don\u2019t mind helping [you] catch\n[the perpetrator], . . . but I would like [you] to help me\nand, you know, I\u2019ll help [you].\u201d Id., at EX479, EX481.\nOnce the family assured Perkins, \u201cwe\u2019re on your side, we\nwant to try and help you,\u201d id., at EX481, Perkins inti\nmated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman,\nhad been involved in Liuzza\u2019s murder. Perkins thereafter\ntold the police what he had learned from Freeman about\nthe murder, and that information was recorded in a police\nreport. Based on Perkins\u2019 account, Thompson and Free\nman were arrested on murder charges.\n  Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name \u201cKojak\u201d\nbecause he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp\nwas visible. Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewit\nness\u2019 initial description of the Liuzza assailant\u2019s height\nand hair style. As the Court notes, ante, at 4, n. 2, Free\nman became the key witness for the prosecution at\nThompson\u2019s trial for the murder of Liuzza.\n  After Thompson\u2019s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the\nfather of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper\nphoto of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Themajority endorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that, when\nThompson was tried for murder, no Brady violation occurred with\nrespect to these audio tapes \u201c[b]ecause defense counsel had knowledge\nof such evidence and could easily have requested access from the\nprosecution.\u201d Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806\u2013807 (1998); ante,\nat 17, n. 11. The basis for that asserted \u201cknowledge\u201d is a mystery. The\nrecordings secretly made did not come to light until long after Thomp\nson\u2019s trials.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nit to his children. He reported to the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice that the children had identified Thompson as their\nattacker, and the children then picked that same photo\nout of a \u201cphotographic lineup.\u201d Record EX120, EX642\u2013\nEX643. Indicting Thompson on the basis of these ques\ntionable identifications, the District Attorney\u2019s Office did\nnot pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpe\ntrator\u2019s blood. This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecu\ntor\u2019s notation that the Office \u201cmay wish to do [a] blood\ntest.\u201d Id., at EX122.\n   The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March\n1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson\nfor robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic\nchoice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceed\ning first on the robbery indictment. Id., at EX128\u2013EX129.\nTheir aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first\nwould serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his\nown defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction\ncould be used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an\narmed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty\nphase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution\u2019s\nplea for the death penalty. Id., at 682.\n   Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,\npetitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the\nParish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric\nDubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases. Dubelier\nenlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to\nassist him in the murder case. Gerry Deegan assisted\nWilliams in the armed robbery case. Bruce Whittaker, the\nfourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved\nThompson\u2019s armed robbery indictment.3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 At the time of their assignment, Dubelier had served in the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office for three and a half years, Williams, for four and a\nhalf years, Deegan, a recent law school graduate, for less than one year,\nand Whittaker, for three years.\n6                      CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n   During pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case,\nThompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials\nand information \u201cfavorable to the defendant\u201d and \u201cmate\nrial and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,\u201d as\nwell as \u201cany results or reports\u201d of \u201cscientific tests or ex\nperiments.\u201d Id., at EX144, EX145. Prosecutorial re\nsponses to this motion fell far short of Brady compliance.4\n   First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel\u2019s inspection of\nthe pant leg swatch stained by the robber\u2019s blood. Al\nthough Dubelier\u2019s April 3 response stated, \u201cInspection to\nbe permitted,\u201d id., at EX149, the swatch was signed out\nfrom the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and\nwas not returned until noon on April 10, the day before\ntrial, id., at EX43, EX670. Thompson\u2019s attorney inspected\nthe evidence made available to him and found no blood\nevidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch\nand its recent removal from the property room. Id., at\nEX701\u2013EX702; Tr. 400\u2013402. But cf. ante, at 17, n. 11\n(Thompson\u2019s attorney had \u201caccess to the evidence locker\nwhere the swatch was recorded as evidence.\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Connick did not dispute that failure to disclose the swatch and the\n\ncrime lab report violated Brady. See Tr. 46, 1095. But cf. ante, at 4, 6\n(limiting Connick\u2019s concession, as Connick himself did not, to failure to\ndisclose the crime lab report).\n   In JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s contrary view, \u201c[t]here was probably no Brady\nviolation at all,\u201d or, if there was any violation of Thompson\u2019s rights, it\n\u201cwas surely on the very frontier of our Brady jurisprudence,\u201d such that\n\u201cConnick could not possibly have been on notice\u201d of the need to train.\nAnte, at 7. Connick\u2019s counsel, however, saw the matter differently.\n\u201c[A]ny reasonable prosecutor would have recognized blood evidence as\nBrady material,\u201d he said, indeed \u201cthe proper response\u201d was \u201cobvious to\nall.\u201d Record 1663, 1665.\n   5 The majority assails as \u201chighly suspect\u201d the suggestion that prose\n\ncutors violated Brady by failing to disclose the blood-stained swatch.\nSee ante, at 17, n. 11. But the parties stipulated in Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983\naction, and the jury was so informed, that, \u201c[p]rior to the armed robbery\ntrial, Mr. Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the existence\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. 952\u2013954.\nWhittaker received the lab report, addressed to his atten\ntion, two days before trial commenced. Immediately\nthereafter, he placed the lab report on Williams\u2019 desk.\nRecord EX151, EX589. Although the lab report conclu\nsively identified the perpetrator\u2019s blood type, id., at\nEX151, the District Attorney\u2019s Office never revealed the\nreport to the defense.6\n   Third, Deegan checked the swatch out of the property\nroom on the morning of the first day of trial, but the\nprosecution did not produce the swatch at trial. Id., at\nEX43. Deegan did not return the swatch to the property\nroom after trial, and the swatch has never been found. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37.\n   \u201c[B]ased solely on the descriptions\u201d provided by the\nthree victims, Record 683, the jury convicted Thompson of\nattempted armed robbery. The court sentenced him to\n49.5 years without possibility of parole\u2014the maximum\navailable sentence.\n                          D\n  Prosecutors continued to disregard Brady during the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof the blood evidence, that the evidence had been tested, [or] that a\nblood type was determined definitively from the swatch . . . .\u201d Tr. 46.\nConsistent with this stipulation, Thompson\u2019s trial counsel testified that\nhe spoke to \u201c[t]he clerk who maintain[ed] the evidence\u201d and learned\nthat \u201c[t]hey didn\u2019t have any blood evidence.\u201d Id., at 401. And the\nDistrict Court instructed the jury, with no objection from Connick, \u201cthat\nthe nonproduced blood evidence . . . violated [Thompson\u2019s] constitu\ntional rights as a matter of law.\u201d Id., at 1095.\n   6 JUSTICE SCALIA questions petitioners\u2019 concession that Brady was\n\nviolated when the prosecution failed to inform Thompson of the blood\nevidence. He considers the evidence outside Brady because the prose\ncution did not endeavor to test Thompson\u2019s blood, and therefore avoided\nknowing that the evidence was in fact exculpatory. Ante, at 6\u20137. Such\na \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d view of a prosecutor\u2019s Brady obligations garners\nno support from precedent. See also supra, at 6, n. 4; infra, at 21, n. 13.\n8                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmurder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution\u2019s\norder-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.7 By prosecuting\nThompson for armed robbery first\u2014and withholding blood\nevidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that\ncharge\u2014the District Attorney\u2019s Office disabled Thompson\nfrom testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.8 As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5, impeaching use of the\nprior conviction would have severely undermined Thomp\nson\u2019s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively\nstopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony\nof the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecu\ntion\u2019s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached\nthose witnesses helped to seal Thompson\u2019s fate.\n   First, the prosecution undermined Thompson\u2019s efforts to\nimpeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered\ninformation to the police with no knowledge of reward\nmoney. Record EX366, EX372\u2013EX373. Because prosecu\ntors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins\u2019 conversa\ntions with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the\ntapes), Thompson\u2019s attorneys could do little to cast doubt\non Perkins\u2019 credibility. In closing argument, the prosecu\ntion emphasized that Thompson presented no \u201cdirect\nevidence\u201d that reward money had motivated any of the\nwitnesses. Id., at EX3171\u2013EX3172.\n   Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson\u2019s impeach\nment of key witness Kevin Freeman. It did so by failing to\ndisclose a police report containing Perkins\u2019 account of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 During jury deliberations in the armed robbery case, Williams, the\n\nonly Orleans Parish trial attorney common to the two prosecutions, told\nThompson of his objective in no uncertain terms: \u201cI\u2019m going to fry you.\nYou will die in the electric chair.\u201d Tr. 252\u2013253.\n  8 The Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded, and Connick does not\n\ndispute, that Thompson \u201cwould have testified in the absence of the\nattempted armed robbery conviction.\u201d State v. Thompson, 2002\u20130361,\np. 7 (7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552, 556. But cf. ante, at 1, 3 (Thompson\n\u201celected\u201d not to testify).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Freeman\u2019s trial testimony was materially\ninconsistent with that report. Tr. 382\u2013384, 612\u2013614;\nRecord EX270\u2013EX274. Lacking any knowledge of the police\nreport, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.\n   Third, and most vital, the eyewitness\u2019 initial description\nof the assailant\u2019s hair, see supra, at 3, was of prime rele\nvance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson,\nmurdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the\neyewitness\u2019 contemporaneous description of the murderer\nshould have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.\nFailure to produce the police reports setting out what the\neyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im\npeach that witness and the police officer who initially\ninterviewed him. The omission left defense counsel with\nout knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the\nkiller\u2019s \u201cclose cut hair\u201d into an \u201cAfro.\u201d\n   Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eye\nwitness\u2019 initial description and Thompson\u2019s appearance.\nThey asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to\nagree on the stand that the perpetrator\u2019s hair was \u201cafro\ntype,\u201d yet \u201cstraight back.\u201d Record EX322\u2013EX323. Cor\nroboratively, the police officer\u2014after refreshing his recol\nlection by reviewing material at the prosecution\u2019s table\u2014\ngave artful testimony. He characterized the witness\u2019\ninitial description of the perpetrator\u2019s hair as \u201cblack and\nshort, afro style.\u201d Id., at EX265 (emphasis added). As\nprosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police\nreports, which described the murderer\u2019s hair simply as\n\u201cclose cut,\u201d portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro\nstyle hair.\n   The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.\nHaving prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman\nwas the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate\nargument. Because Thompson was already serving a\n10                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nnear-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prose\ncution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was\nto execute him. The strategy worked as planned; Thomp\nson was sentenced to death.\n                             E\n   Thompson discovered the prosecutors\u2019 misconduct\nthrough a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine\nyears after Thompson\u2019s convictions, Deegan, the assistant\nprosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was\nterminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his\nfriend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood\nevidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.\nDeegan did not heed Riehlmann\u2019s counsel to reveal what\nhe had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former\nOrleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan\u2019s confession to\nhimself. Id., at EX712\u2013EX713.\n   On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled\nThompson\u2019s execution. Id., at EX1366\u2013EX1367. In an\neleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson\u2019s attorneys\nhired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab ar\nchives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the\nlab report identifying the robber\u2019s blood type. The copy\nshowed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.\nSee supra, at 7.         Thompson\u2019s attorneys contacted\nWhittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report\nhad been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker\nthat Deegan \u201chad failed to turn over stuff that might have\nbeen exculpatory.\u201d Tr. 718.

A full hearing\nwas unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con\nfessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery\ncharges. See, e.g., id., at EX617.

A.\u2019s . . . sitting in this courtroom watching\n    this, and I hope they take home . . . and take to heart\n    the message that this kind of conduct cannot go on in\n    this Parish if this Criminal Justice System is going to\n    work.\u201d Id., at EX883.\n  The District Attorney\u2019s Office then initiated grand jury\nproceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the\nlab report. Connick terminated the grand jury after just\none day. He maintained that the lab report would not be\nBrady material if prosecutors did not know Thompson\u2019s\nblood type. Tr. 986; cf. supra, at 7, n. 6. And he told the\ninvestigating prosecutor that the grand jury \u201cw[ould]\nmake [his] job more difficult.\u201d Tr. 978\u2013979. In protest,\nthat prosecutor tendered his resignation.\n                             F\n  Thereafter, the Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed\nThompson\u2019s murder conviction. State v. Thompson, 2002\u2013\n0361, p. 10 (7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552, 558. The unlawfully\nprocured robbery conviction, the court held, had violated\n12                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThompson\u2019s right to testify and thus fully present his\ndefense in the murder trial. Id., at 557. The merits of\nseveral Brady claims arising out of the murder trial, the\ncourt observed, had therefore become \u201cmoot.\u201d 825 So. 2d,\nat 555; see also Record 684.9 But cf. ante, at 10\u201311, n. 7,\n16\u201317, n. 11 (suggesting that there were no Brady viola\ntions in the murder prosecution because no court had\nadjudicated any violations).10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Thompson argued that \u201cthe State failed to produce police reports\n\n\u2018and other information\u2019 which would have identified \u2018eye- and ear\nwitnesses\u2019 whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated\n[Freeman], . . . and would have shown that [Perkins,] . . . who stated\n[he] heard [Thompson] admit to committing the murder[,] had been\npromised reward money for [his] testimony.\u201d Thompson, 825 So. 2d, at\n555. In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of\nAppeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s earlier assessment\nof those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161\nF. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp\nson was \u201cbelatedly tr[ying] to reverse\u201d the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision. But\ncf. ante, at 17, n. 11.\n   10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re\n\njected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those\nclaims as \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161\nF. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the\ndate of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of\nthe Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had\nthe opportunity for discovery in his \u00a71983 suit, and before Thompson or\nany court was aware of the \u201cclose cut hair\u201d police reports. See Thomp\nson, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little\nThompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth\nCircuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins\u2019 statement recorded in the police\nreport did not \u201cdiffer from Freeman\u2019s trial testimony.\u201d Id., at 808. But\nevidence put before the jury in 2007 in the \u00a71983 trial showed that the\npolice report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with\nFreeman\u2019s trial testimony. Tr. 382\u2013383.\n   Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the \u00a71983\ntrial was bound by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s 1998 Brady rulings. That court\n\u201cafford[ed] great deference to\u201d the state trial court\u2019s findings, made\nafter a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at\n805. The jury in the \u00a71983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and\naccurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   13\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Undeterred by his assistants\u2019 disregard of Thompson\u2019s\nrights, Connick retried him for the Liuzza murder.\nThompson\u2019s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier\nunavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not\ndisclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly\nproduced items included police reports describing the\nassailant in the murder case as having \u201cclose cut\u201d hair, the\npolice report recounting Perkins\u2019 meetings with the Liuzza\nfamily, see supra, at 3\u20134, audio recordings of those meet\nings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After\ndeliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson\nnot guilty.\n  On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years\nin prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was\nreleased.\n                              II\n   On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 alleging that Connick, other\nofficials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office,\nand the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights\nby wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson\nsought to hold Connick and the District Attorney\u2019s Office\nliable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern\ning their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I\nagree with the Court, only when the failure \u201camount[s] to\n\u2018deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom\nthe [untrained employees] come into contact.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9\n(quoting Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388 (1989)). I\ndisagree, however, with the Court\u2019s conclusion that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nearlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in\n1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered Brady violations and by\nConnick\u2019s reluctance to bring those violations to light. See supra, at\n10\u201311. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that\nassessed Connick\u2019s deliberate indifference in the \u00a71983 trial to defer to\nfindings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.\n14                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.\n   Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the \u00a71983\ncase found for Thompson, concluding that the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office had been deliberately indifferent to\nThompson\u2019s Brady rights and to the need for training and\nsupervision to safeguard those rights. \u201cViewing the evi\ndence in the light most favorable to [Thompson], as appro\npriate in light of the verdic[t] rendered by the jury,\u201d Pat\nrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 98, n. 3 (1988), I see no cause\nto upset the District Court\u2019s determination, affirmed by\nthe Fifth Circuit, that \u201cample evidence . . . adduced at\ntrial\u201d supported the jury\u2019s verdict. Record 1917.\n   Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality\u2019s\nfailure to provide training may be so egregious that, even\nwithout notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure\n\u201ccould properly be characterized as \u2018deliberate indiffer\nence\u2019 to constitutional rights.\u201d Canton, 489 U. S., at 390,\nn. 10. \u201c[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers\nor employees,\u201d Canton recognized, \u201cit may happen that . . .\nthe need for more or different training is so obvious, and\nthe inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of consti\ntutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably\nbe said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.\u201d\nId., at 390. Thompson presented convincing evidence to\nsatisfy this standard.\n                             A\n  Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two\ntheories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office\u2019s\nofficial Brady policy was unconstitutional; and second,\nConnick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to\ntrain his prosecutors about their Brady obligations. Con\nnick\u2019s Brady policy directed prosecutors to \u201cturn over what\nwas required by state and federal law, but no more.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 6\u20137.

Ante, at 5.\n  The jury found, however, that Connick was deliberately\nindifferent to the need to train prosecutors about Brady\u2019s\ncommand. On the special verdict form, the jury answered\nyes to the following question:\n     \u201cWas the Brady violation in the armed robbery case or\n     any infringements of John Thompson\u2019s rights in the\n     murder trial substantially caused by [Connick\u2019s] fail\n     ure, through deliberate indifference, to establish poli\n     cies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime\n     from these constitutional violations?\u201d Record 1585.\n  Consistent with the question put to the jury, and with\nout objection, the court instructed the jurors: \u201c[Y]ou are\nnot limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the\nresulting infringement of Mr. Thompson\u2019s right to testify\nat the murder trial. You may consider all of the evidence\npresented during this trial.\u201d Tr. 1099; Record 1620.11 But\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The   court permitted Thompson to introduce evidence of other\nBrady violations, but because \u201cthe blood evidence alone proved the\nviolation [of Thompson\u2019s constitutional rights],\u201d the court declined\nspecifically \u201cto ask the jury [whether] this other stuff [was] also Brady.\u201d\nTr. 1003. The court allowed Thompson to submit proof of other viola\ntions to \u201csho[w] the cumulative nature . . . and impact [of] evidence . . .\nas to . . . the training and deliberate indifference . . . .\u201d Ibid. But cf.\nante, at 17, n. 11 (questioning how \u201cthese violations are relevant\u201d to\nthis case). Far from indulging in my own factfindings, but cf. ante, at\n16\u201317, n. 11, I simply recite the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict\nin Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983 trial.\n   The Court misleadingly states that \u201cthe District Court instructed the\njury that the \u2018only issue\u2019 was whether the nondisclosure [of the crime\nlab report] was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the dis\ntrict attorney\u2019s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the\noffice\u2019s prosecutors.\u201d Ante, at 4. The jury instruction the majority cites\nsimply directed the jury that, with regard to the blood evidence, as a\nmatter of law, Thompson\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\nRecord 1614\u20131615. The court did not preclude the jury from assessing\nevidence of other infringements of Thompson\u2019s rights. Id., at 1585; see\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995) (\u201c[T]he state\u2019s obligation\n16                   CONNICK v.

That evidence included a stipulation that in his\nretrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced\nten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by\nthe prosecution in 1985. See supra, at 13.\n   Abundant evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that\nadditional Brady training was obviously necessary to\nensure that Brady violations would not occur: (1) Connick,\nthe Office\u2019s sole policymaker, misunderstood Brady. (2)\nOther leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility\nfor training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly\nuninformed about Brady. (3) Prosecutors in the Office\nreceived no Brady training. (4) The Office shirked its\nresponsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal\ndevelopments concerning Brady requirements. As a result\nof these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that\nBrady violations in fact occurred, severely undermining\nthe integrity of Thompson\u2019s trials.\n                             1\n  Connick was the Office\u2019s sole policymaker, and his\ntestimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecu\ntor\u2019s Brady obligations. First, Connick admitted to the\njury that his earlier understanding of Brady, conveyed in\nprior sworn testimony, had been too narrow. Tr. 181\u2013182.\nSecond, Connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab\nreport \u201cone time as a prosecutor and I got indicted by the\nU. S. Attorney over here for doing it.\u201d Id., at 872. Third,\neven at trial Connick persisted in misstating Brady\u2019s\nrequirements. For example, Connick urged that there\ncould be no Brady violation arising out of \u201cthe inadvertent\nconduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nunder Brady . . . turns on the cumulative effect of all . . . evidence \n\nsuppressed by the government . . . .\u201d). \n\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The court, however, correctly in\nstructed the jury that, in determining whether there has\nbeen a Brady violation, the \u201cgood or bad faith of the prose\ncution does not matter.\u201d Tr. 1094\u20131095.\n                               2\n  The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice revealed similar misunderstandings. Those misun\nderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part re\nsponsible for the gross disregard of Brady rights Thomp\nson experienced.       Dubelier admitted that he never\nreviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag\nany potential Brady information. Tr. 542. The court,\nhowever, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor\nhas a \u201cduty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known\nto others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case,\nincluding the police.\u201d Id., at 1095; Record 1614. Williams\nwas asked whether \u201cBrady material includes documents in\nthe possession of the district attorney that could be used to\nimpeach a witness, to show that he\u2019s lying\u201d; he responded\nsimply, and mistakenly, \u201cNo.\u201d Tr. 381. The testimony of\n\u201chigh-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District\nAttorney\u2019s Office,\u201d Thompson\u2019s expert explained,12 exposed\n\u201ccomplete errors . . . as to what Brady required [prosecu\ntors] to do.\u201d Id., at 427, 434. \u201cDubelier had no under\nstanding of his obligations under Brady whatsoever,\u201d id.,\nat 458, the expert observed, and Williams \u201cis still not sure\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 With no objection from petitioners, the court found Thompson\u2019s\n\nexpert, Joseph Lawless, qualified to testify as an expert in criminal law\nand procedure. Tr. 419, 426. Lawless has practiced criminal law for 30\nyears; from 1976 to 1979, he was an assistant district attorney, and\nthereafter he entered private practice. Id., at 412.

But\ncf. ante, at 4\u20135 (\u201c[I]t was undisputed at trial that the\nprosecutors were familiar with the general Brady re\nquirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence\nin its possession that is favorable to the accused.\u201d).\n   The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\u2019s\nrights directly to prosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady.\nThe prosecution had no obligation to produce the \u201cclose-cut\nhair\u201d police reports, Williams maintained, because news\npaper reports had suggested that witness descrip\ntions were not consistent with Thompson\u2019s appearance.\nTherefore, Williams urged, the defense already \u201chad every\nthing.\u201d Tr. 139. Dubelier tendered an alternative ex\nplanation for the nondisclosure. In Dubelier\u2019s view, the\ndescriptions were not \u201cinconsistent with [Thompson\u2019s]\nappearance,\u201d as portrayed in a police photograph showing\nThompson\u2019s hair extending at least three inches above his\nforehead. Id., at 171\u2013172; Record EX73. Williams in\nsisted that he had discharged the prosecution\u2019s duty to\ndisclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion\nhearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood\nsample from Thompson. Tr. 393\u2013394. During the armed\nrobbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the\nresults of the blood test made on the swatch had been\n\u201cinconclusive.\u201d Id., at 962. And he testified in the \u00a71983\naction that the lab report was not Brady material \u201cbecause\nI didn\u2019t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.\u201d\nTr. 393. But see supra, at 6\u20137, n. 5 (District Court in\nstructed the jury that the lab report was Brady material).\n                             3\n  Connick should have comprehended that Orleans Parish\nprosecutors lacked essential guidance on Brady and its\napplication. In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that\nBrady training in his Office was inadequate. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 60. Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors\u2019\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

But the jury\nheard ample evidence that Connick\u2019s Office gave prosecu\ntors no Brady guidance, and had installed no procedures\nto monitor Brady compliance.\n  In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors\n\u201cwere coming fresh out of law school,\u201d and the Office\u2019s\n\u201c[h]uge turnover\u201d allowed attorneys with little experience\nto advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853\u2013\n854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the\nhighest ranking attorneys in the Office, id., at 342, 356\u2013\n357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as\na prosecutor, see supra, at 5, n. 3; Record EX746; Tr. 55,\n571\u2013576.\n  Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in\nConnick\u2019s Office, and, as earlier observed, see supra, at\n17\u201318, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient\nunderstanding of Brady. Dubelier and Williams told the\njury that they did not recall any Brady training in the\nOffice. Tr. 170\u2013171, 364.\n  Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, includ\ning Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were\nfamiliar with their Brady obligations. Tr. 805\u2013806. Yet\nConnick did not inquire whether the supervisors them\nselves understood the importance of teaching newer prose\ncutors about Brady. Riehlmann could not \u201crecall that [he]\nwas ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his]\nBrady obligations,\u201d on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728\u2013729.\nWhittaker agreed it was possible for \u201cinexperienced law\nyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,\u201d\nto bear responsibility for \u201cdecisions on . . . whether mate\nrial was Brady material and had to be produced.\u201d Id., at\n319.\n  Thompson\u2019s expert characterized Connick\u2019s supervision\nregarding Brady as \u201cthe blind leading the blind.\u201d Tr. 458.\n20                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, in 1985 trial attorneys \u201csometimes . . . went\nto Mr. Connick\u201d with Brady questions, \u201cand he would tell\nthem\u201d how to proceed. Tr. 892. But Connick acknowl\nedged that he had \u201cstopped reading law books . . . and\nlooking at opinions\u201d when he was first elected District\nAttorney in 1974. Id., at 175\u2013176.\n   As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly at\ntended a pretrial conference with the Office\u2019s chief of trials\nbefore taking a case to trial. Connick intended the prac\ntice to provide both training and accountability. But it\nachieved neither aim in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions, for\nDubelier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office,\nwere free to take cases to trial without pretrying them,\nand that is just how they proceeded in Thompson\u2019s prose\ncutions.

But cf. ante, at 13\n(\u201c[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\u201d).\n   Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office, overall, was deficient.

Tr. 361. But cf. ante, at\n12\u201313. Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors au\ncourant with developments in the law, therefore, resided\nin the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Over the course of Con\nnick\u2019s tenure as District Attorney, the jury learned, the\nOffice\u2019s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when ap\npellate courts issued important opinions.

But cf.\nante, at 7 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (questioning how Connick could have\nbeen on notice of the need to train prosecutors about the Brady viola\ntions conceded in this case).\n   14 The Court can scarcely disagree with respect to Dubelier, Williams,\n\nand Whittaker, for it acknowledges the \u201cflagran[cy]\u201d of Deegan\u2019s con\nduct, see ante, at 7, n. 5, and does not dispute that, pretrial, other\nprosecutors knew of the existence of the swatch and lab report.\n   15 Section 5.25 of the manual, titled \u201cBrady Material,\u201d states in full:\n\n\u201cIn most cases, in response to the request of defense attorneys, the\nJudge orders the State to produce so called Brady material\u2014that is,\ninformation in the possession of the State which is exculpatory regard\ning the defendant.

For\nexample, the manual did not acknowledge what Giglio v.\nUnited States, 405 U.

In all cases, a review of\nBrady issues, including apparently self-serving statements made by the\ndefendant, must be included in a pre-trial conference and each Assis\ntant must be familiar with the law regarding exculpatory information\npossessed by the State.\u201d Record EX427.\n   16 During the relevant time period, there were many significant de\n\nvelopments in this Court\u2019s Brady jurisprudence. Among the Brady\nrelated decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (\u201cThis Court has rejected any . . . distinction\nbetween impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady\ncontext].\u201d); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559\u2013560 (1977)\n(\u201cBrady is not implicated . . . where the only claim is that the State\nshould have revealed that it would present the eyewitness testimony of\na particular agent against the defendant at trial.\u201d); and United States v.\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103, 104, 106\u2013107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise\nwhen \u201cthe undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution\u2019s\ncase includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or\nshould have known, of the perjury,\u201d when defense counsel makes \u201ca\npretrial request for specific evidence\u201d and the government fails to\naccede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and\nthe government fails to disclose \u201cobviously exculpatory\u201d evidence).\nThese decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled\ncirculated memoranda.\n   In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of\nopinions discussing Brady, including State v.

First, Connick did not ensure that\nprosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he\nneither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he\nhired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his\nwatch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor\ning was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,\nConnick\u2019s cavalier approach to his staff\u2019s knowledge and\nobservation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul\nture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an\neffort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli\nance because he felt the effort would \u201cmake [his] job more\ndifficult.\u201d Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single\nprosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182\u2013183. The jury was\ntold of this Court\u2019s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick\u2019s Office\nthat garnered attention because it featured \u201cso many\ninstances of the state\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory\nevidence.\u201d Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When\nquestioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was\nsatisfied with his Office\u2019s practices and saw no need,\noccasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184\u2013185.\nIn both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed\nhere was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi\nnation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under\nhim were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,\nthey were deliberately indifferent to what the law\nrequires.\n                           B\n  In Canton, this Court spoke of circumstances in which\nthe need for training may be \u201cso obvious,\u201d and the lack of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nprosecution fails, even inadvertently, to disclose bargain with a wit\nness).\n\n24                    CONNICK v.

This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category\nCanton marked out.\n   Canton offered an often-cited illustration. \u201c[C]ity poli\ncymakers know to a moral certainty that their police\nofficers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.\u201d Ibid.,\nn. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police\nofficers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The\nneed to instruct armed officers about \u201cconstitutional limi\ntations on the use of deadly force,\u201d Canton said, is \u201c \u2018so\nobvious,\u2019 that failure to [train the officers] could properly\nbe characterized as \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to constitu\ntional rights.\u201d Ibid.\n   The District Court, tracking Canton\u2019s language, in\nstructed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his\n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d claim only if the evidence per\nsuaded the jury on three points. First, Connick \u201cwas\ncertain that prosecutors would confront the situation\nwhere they would have to decide which evidence was\nrequired by the Constitution to be provided to the ac\ncused.\u201d Tr. 1099. Second, \u201cthe situation involved a diffi\ncult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of\nmishandling, such that additional training, supervision or\nmonitoring was clearly needed.\u201d Ibid. Third, \u201cthe wrong\nchoice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently\ncause a deprivation of an accused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d\nIbid.; Record 1619\u20131620; see Canton, 489 U.

The District Court\u2019s charge, how\never, cautiously cabined the jury\u2019s assessment of Connick\u2019s deliberate\nindifference. See, e.g., Tr. 1100 (\u201cMr. Thompson must prove that more\nlikely than not the Brady material would have been produced if the\nprosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly\ntrained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of Brady\nevidence.\u201d). See also id., at 1096\u20131097, 1099\u20131100.\n   The deliberate indifference jury instruction in this case was based on\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in Walker v. New York, 974 F. 2d 293, 297\u2013\n298 (1992), applying Canton to a \u00a71983 complaint alleging that a\ndistrict attorney failed to train prosecutors about Brady. JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s fears should be calmed by post-Walker experience in the\nSecond Circuit. There has been no \u201clitigation flood or even rainfall,\u201d\nSkinner v. Switzer, 562 U.

See Brief for National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 39 (\u201cTellingly, in the Second Cir\ncuit, in the nearly 20 years since the court decided Walker, there have\nbeen no successful lawsuits for non-Brady constitutional violations\ncommitted by prosecutors at trial (and no reported \u2018single violation\u2019\nBrady case).\u201d (citation omitted)); Brief for Center on the Administration\nof Criminal Law, New York University School of Law, et al. as Amici\nCuriae 35\u201336 (Walker has prompted \u201cno flood of \u00a71983 liability\u201d).\n   18 The instruction Connick proposed resembled the charge given by\n\nthe District Court. See supra, at 24. Connick\u2019s proposed instruction\nread: \u201cBefore a district attorney\u2019s failure to train or supervise consti\ntutes deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens: (1)\nthe plaintiff must show that Harry Connick knew \u2018to a moral certainty\u2019\nthat his employees will confront a given situation; (2) the plaintiff must\nshow that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult\nchoice . . . such that training or supervision will make the choice less\ndifficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situa\ntion; and (3) the plaintiff must show that the wrong choice by the\nassistant district attorney will frequently cause the deprivation of a\ncitizen\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Record 992 (citing Canton, 489 U.

See\nCanton, 489 U. S., at 390, n. 10.\n   The jury, furthermore, could reasonably find that Brady\nrights may involve choices so difficult that Connick obvi\nously knew or should have known prosecutors needed\nmore than perfunctory training to make the correct\nchoices. See Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10.19 As\ndemonstrated earlier, see supra, at 16\u201318, even at trial\nprosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their\nBrady obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see\nsupra, at 18\u201320, the evidence permitted the jury to con\nclude that Connick should have known Brady training in\nhis office bordered on \u201czero.\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\nMoreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors\nneeded \u201cvery clear\u201d guidance and should not be left to\ngrapple with Brady on their own. Tr. 834\u2013835. It was\nthus \u201cobvious\u201d to him, the jury could find, that constitu\ntional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received\nslim to no Brady training.\n   Based on the evidence presented, the jury could con\nclude that Brady errors by untrained prosecutors would\nfrequently cause deprivations of defendants\u2019 constitutional\nrights. The jury learned of several Brady oversights in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Petitioners, it is true, argued all along that \u201c[t]o prove deliberate\nindifference, Thompson had to demonstrate a pattern of violations,\u201d\nBrief for Appellants in No. 07\u201330443 (CA5), p. 41; see ante, at 3\u20134\n(SCALIA, J., concurring), but the court rejected their categorical position.\nPetitioners did not otherwise assail the District Court\u2019s formulation of\nthe deliberate indifference instruction. E.g., Record 1662.\n  19 Courts have noted the often trying nature of a prosecutor\u2019s Brady\n\nobligation. See, e.g., State v. Whitlock, 454 So. 2d 871, 874 (La.

Because prosecutors faced considerable pressure\nto get convictions, id., at 317, 341, and were instructed to\n\u201cturn over what was required by state and federal law, but\nno more,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 6\u20137, the risk was all too\nreal that they would err by withholding rather than re\nvealing information favorable to the defense.\n   In sum, despite JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s protestations to the\ncontrary, ante, at 1, 5, the Brady violations in Thompson\u2019s\nprosecutions were not singular and they were not aberra\ntional. They were just what one would expect given the\nattitude toward Brady pervasive in the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice. Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five\nprosecutors\u2014the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann\u2014\ndisregarded his Brady rights. He established that they\nkept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his de\nfense. Their conduct, he showed with equal force, was a\nforeseeable consequence of lax training in, and absence of\nmonitoring of, a legal requirement fundamental to a fair\ntrial.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 The jury could draw a direct, causal connection between Connick\u2019s\n\ndeliberate indifference, prosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady, and the\nBrady violations in Thompson\u2019s case. See, e.g., supra, at 17 (prosecu\ntors\u2019 misunderstandings of Brady \u201cwere in large part responsible for the\ngross disregard of Brady rights Thompson experienced\u201d); supra, at 18\n(\u201cThe jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\u2019s rights directly to\nprosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady.\u201d); supra, at 17\u201318 (Williams did\nnot believe Brady required disclosure of impeachment evidence and did\nnot believe he had any obligation to turn over the impeaching \u201cclose-cut\nhair\u201d police reports); supra, at 18 (At the time of the armed robbery\ntrial, Williams reported that the results of the blood test on the swatch\nwere \u201cinconclusive\u201d); ibid.

Vigilance in\nsuperintending prosecutors\u2019 attention to Brady\u2019s require\nment is all the more important for this reason: A Brady\nviolation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence\nbeyond the defendant\u2019s capacity to ferret out. Because the\nabsence of the withheld evidence may result in the convic\ntion of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to\nimpose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring\nthe information to light.\n   The Court nevertheless holds Canton\u2019s example inappo\nsite. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics\nrules, and training\u2014including on-the-job training\u2014set\nattorneys apart from other municipal employees, including\nrookie police officers. Ante, at 12\u201315. Connick \u201chad every\nincentive at trial to attempt to establish\u201d that he could\nreasonably rely on the professional education and status of\nhis staff.

Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the\npresent, Brady questions have not accounted for even\n10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure\nsection of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Exami\nnation.22 A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examina\ntion, moreover, need pass only five of the exam\u2019s nine\nsections.23 One can qualify for admission to the profession\nwith no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal\nlaw and procedure.\n   The majority\u2019s suggestion that lawyers do not need\nBrady training because they \u201care equipped with the tools\nto find, interpret, and apply legal principles,\u201d ante, at 17\u2013\n18, \u201cblinks reality\u201d and is belied by the facts of this case.\nSee Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and\nProsecutors as Amici Curiae 13. Connick himself recog\nnized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience,\nwere not so equipped. Indeed, \u201cunderstanding and com\nplying with Brady obligations are not easy tasks, and the\nappropriate way to resolve Brady issues is not always self\nevident.\u201d Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials\nand Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 6. \u201cBrady compliance,\u201d\ntherefore, \u201cis too much at risk, and too fundamental to the\nfairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for\ngranted,\u201d and \u201ctraining remains critical.\u201d Id., at 3, 7.\n   The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations is necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence to defendants\u2019 Brady rights.

Con\nducting this inquiry, the Court has acknowledged, \u201cmay not be an easy\ntask for the factfinder.\u201d Canton v. Harris, 489 U.

But cf. ante, at 16\u201318\n(suggesting that under no set of facts could a plaintiff establish deliber\nate indifference for failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligation\nwithout showing a prior pattern of violations).\n    25 When Congress sought to render a claim for relief contingent on\n\nshowing a pattern or practice, it did so expressly. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a714141(a) (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any governmental authority . . . to\nengage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\n. . . that deprives persons of rights . . . protected by the Constitution\n. . . .\u201d); 15 U.

See\nante, at 14\u201315. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See\nsupra, at 18\u201320.\n    27 For example, a prosecutor\u2019s office could be deliberately indifferent if\n\nit had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed\nto provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their Brady\nobligations in the altered circumstances. Or a district attorney could be\ndeliberately indifferent if he had a practice of paring well-trained\nprosecutors with untrained prosecutors, knew that such supervision\n32                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncase is one such instance. Connick, who himself had been\nindicted for suppression of evidence, created a tinderbox in\nOrleans Parish in which Brady violations were nigh inevi\ntable. And when they did occur, Connick insisted there\nwas no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to\nhold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so\nwould make his job more difficult.\n   A District Attorney aware of his office\u2019s high turnover\nrate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and\npromotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsi\nbility for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place. In\nshort, the buck stops with him.28 As the Court recognizes,\n\u201cthe duty to produce Brady evidence to the defense\u201d is\n\u201c[a]mong prosecutors\u2019 unique ethical obligations.\u201d Ante, at\n13. The evidence in this case presents overwhelming\nsupport for the conclusion that the Orleans Parish Office\nslighted its responsibility to the profession and to the\nState\u2019s system of justice by providing no on-the-job Brady\ntraining. Connick was not \u201centitled to rely on prosecutors\u2019\nprofessional training,\u201d ante, at 14, for Connick himself\nshould have been the principal insurer of that training.\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe U.

Canton recognized that deliberate indifference\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same.\n489 U. S., at 385, 388\u2013389.

Argued October 6, 2010\u2014Decided March 29, 2011\nPetitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office concedes that,\n  in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery,\n  prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to\n  disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction,\n  Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was\n  convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report\n  was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and\n  Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He\n  then filed suit against the district attorney\u2019s office under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the\n  office\u2019s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors\n  to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that,\n  to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a\n  pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that\n  the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attor\n  ney\u2019s office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson dam\n  ages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.\nHeld: A district attorney\u2019s office may not be held liable under \u00a71983 for\n  failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation. Pp.\n  6\u201320.\n     (a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose \u00a71983 liability on local governments\n  must prove that their injury was caused by \u201caction pursuant to offi\n  cial municipal policy,\u201d which includes the decisions of a government\u2019s\n  lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so\n  persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\n  Monell v.

Har\n    ris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context re\n    quires proof that city policymakers disregarded the \u201cknown or obvi\n    ous consequence\u201d that a particular omission in their training\n    program would cause city employees to violate citizens\u2019 constitutional\n    rights. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.\n    Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained em\n    ployees is \u201cordinarily necessary\u201d to demonstrate deliberate indiffer\n    ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of\n    training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have delib\n    erately chosen a training program that will cause violations of consti\n    tutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern\n    of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for\n    dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial\n    could not have put the district attorney\u2019s office on notice of the need\n    for specific training. Pp. 9\u201310.\n       (c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the \u201csingle-incident\u201d liability\n    hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his\n    case was the \u201cobvious\u201d consequence of failing to provide specific\n    Brady training and that this \u201cobviousness\u201d showing can substitute\n    for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish munici\n    pal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed\n    its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing\n    felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on\n    the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city\u2019s de\n    liberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely,\n    violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in\n    their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Can\n    ton\u2019s hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\n    cific legal training present in Canton\u2019s scenario\u2014police academy ap\n    plicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on\n    deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge\u2014is\n    absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\n    tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitu\n    tional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training be\n    fore entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing educa\n    tion requirements, often train on the job with more experienced\n    attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical\n    obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically\n    bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations\n  are not the \u201cobvious consequence\u201d of failing to provide prosecutors\n  with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary\n  training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.\n  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.\n  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with\n  constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but\n  must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady\n  evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.\n  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate\n  indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow\n  that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif\n  ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing\n  to train them amounts, as it must, to \u201ca decision by the city itself to\n  violate the Constitution.\u201d Canton, 489 U.

Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Thompson\nwas convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson\nelected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial\nfor murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent\n18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One\nmonth before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, his inves\ntigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his\narmed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that\nthe evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson\u2019s\nconvictions were vacated.\n   After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner\nHarry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans\nParish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat.\n\u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Thompson alleged that Connick\nhad failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their\nduty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of\n2                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson\u2019s rob\nbery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million,\nand the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by\nan evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to\ndecide whether a district attorney\u2019s office may be held\nliable under \u00a71983 for failure to train based on a single\nBrady violation. We hold that it cannot.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the\nmurder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Pub\nlicity following the murder charge led the victims of an\nunrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their\nattacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with\nattempted armed robbery.\n   As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene\ntechnician took from one of the victims\u2019 pants a swatch of\nfabric stained with the robber\u2019s blood. Approximately one\nweek before Thompson\u2019s armed robbery trial, the swatch\nwas sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the\ntrial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received\nthe crime lab\u2019s report, which stated that the perpetrator\nhad blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecu\ntors ever had Thompson\u2019s blood tested or that they knew\nwhat his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the\nreport on assistant district attorney James Williams\u2019 desk,\nbut Williams denied seeing it. The report was never dis\nclosed to Thompson\u2019s counsel.\n   Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant\ndistrict attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial,\nDeegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out\nof the police property room, including the blood-stained\nswatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the\nswatch into the courthouse property room. The prosecu\ntors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at\n                   Cite as: 563 U.

The only\nclaim that proceeded to trial was Thompson\u2019s claim under\n\u00a71983 that the district attorney\u2019s office had violated Brady\nby failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed\nrobbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged\nliability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was\ncaused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor\nney\u2019s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick\u2019s\ndeliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the\nprosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu\ntional violations.\n   Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro\nduce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3\nSee Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that the \u201conly issue\u201d was whether the\nnondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or\ncustom of the district attorney\u2019s office or a deliberately\nindifferent failure to train the office\u2019s prosecutors. Record\n1615.\n   Although no prosecutor remembered any specific train\ning session regarding Brady prior to 1985, it was undis\nputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and pre\n\nsented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.\nThat man, the government\u2019s key witness at the first murder trial, had\ndied in the interval between the first and second trials.\n  3 Because Connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab\n\nreport violated Brady, that question is not presented here, and we do\nnot address it.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Prosecutors testified that office policy was to\nturn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over\nto the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery\nof the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors\ndisagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under\nBrady absent knowledge of Thompson\u2019s blood type.\n   The jury rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that an unconstitu\ntional office policy caused the Brady violation, but found\nthe district attorney\u2019s office liable for failing to train the\nprosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in\ndamages, and the District Court added more than $1\nmillion in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\n   After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection\u2014which\nhe had raised on summary judgment\u2014that he could not\nhave been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for\nmore or different Brady training because there was no\nevidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar Brady\nviolations. The District Court rejected this argument for\nthe reasons that it had given in the summary judgment\norder. In that order, the court had concluded that a pat\ntern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate\nindifference when the need for training is \u201cso obvious.\u201d\nNo. Civ.

Relying on Canton\nv. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989), the court had held that\nThompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by\nproving that \u201cthe DA\u2019s office knew to a moral certainty\nthat assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire Brady\nmaterial, that without training it is not always obvious\nwhat Brady requires, and that withholding Brady mate\nrial will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of\nconstitutional rights.\u201d4 App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 The   District Court rejected Connick\u2019s proposed deliberate indiffer\n6                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nWL 3541035, *13.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not\npresent evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,\n553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not\nneed to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the\npanel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on\nnotice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting\nevidence \u201cthat attorneys, often fresh out of law school,\nwould undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues\nwhile at the DA\u2019s Office, that erroneous decisions regard\ning Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional\nviolations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un\nclear, and that training in Brady would have been help\nful.\u201d 553 F. 3d, at 854.\n   The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel\nopinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby\naffirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)\n(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court\ndisputed whether Thompson could establish municipal\nliability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the\nsingle Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make\nthat showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when\none or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp\nson\u2019s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the\ncrime lab report to Thompson\u2019s counsel. Under Thomp\nson\u2019s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving\nboth (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district\nattorney\u2019s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nence jury instruction\u2014which would have required Thompson to prove a\npattern of similar violations\u2014for the same reasons as the summary\njudgment motion.

Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as\na matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he\nwas on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore\ndeliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different\nBrady training. We agree.5\n                             A\n  Title 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 provides in relevant part:\n       \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordi\n     nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . .\n     subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Because  we conclude that Thompson failed to prove deliberate indif\nference, we need not reach causation. Thus, we do not address whether\nthe alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the \u201c \u2018moving\nforce,\u2019 \u201d Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 389 (1989) (quoting Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), and\nPolk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 326 (1981)), that \u201cactually\ncaused\u201d the failure to disclose the crime lab report, Canton, supra, at\n391.\n   The same cannot be said for the dissent, however. Affirming the\nverdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved\ndeliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsur\nprisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,\nwhich would require showing that the failure to provide particular\ntraining (which the dissent never clearly identifies) \u201cactually caused\u201d\nthe flagrant\u2014and quite possibly intentional\u2014misconduct that occurred\nin this case. See post, at 21 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (assuming that,\n\u201c[h]ad Brady\u2019s importance been brought home to prosecutors,\u201d the\nviolation at issue \u201csurely\u201d would not have occurred). The dissent\nbelieves that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly \u201cmisappre\nhen[ded]\u201d Brady proves causation. Post, at 27, n. 20. Of course, if\nevidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that\nthe lack of training \u201cactually caused\u201d the violation at issue, no causa\ntion requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who\nsatisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily\nsatisfy the causation requirement.\n8                  CONNICK v.

Cincin\nnati, 475 U. S. 469, 479 (1986) (citing Monell, 436 U. S., at\n665\u2013683). They are not vicariously liable under \u00a71983 for\ntheir employees\u2019 actions. See id., at 691; Canton, 489\nU. S., at 392; Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown,\n520 U.

Monell, 436\nU. S., at 691; see id., at 694. Official municipal policy\nincludes the decisions of a government\u2019s lawmakers, the\nacts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persis\ntent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\nSee ibid.; Pembaur, supra, at 480\u2013481; Adickes v.

These are\n\u201caction[s] for which the municipality is actually responsi\nble.\u201d Pembaur, supra, at 479\u2013480.\n  In limited circumstances, a local government\u2019s decision\nnot to train certain employees about their legal duty to\navoid violating citizens\u2019 rights may rise to the level of an\nofficial government policy for purposes of \u00a71983. A mu\nnicipality\u2019s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its\nmost tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Thus, when city policymakers are on\nactual or constructive notice that a particular omission in\ntheir training program causes city employees to violate\ncitizens\u2019 constitutional rights, the city may be deemed\ndeliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to\nretain that program. Id., at 407. The city\u2019s \u201cpolicy of\ninaction\u201d in light of notice that its program will cause\nconstitutional violations \u201cis the functional equivalent of a\ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\u201d\nCanton, 489 U.

Without notice\nthat a course of training is deficient in a particular re\nspect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliber\nately chosen a training program that will cause violations\nof constitutional rights.\n   Although Thompson does not contend that he proved a\npattern of similar Brady violations, 553 F. 3d, at 851,\nvacated, 578 F. 3d 293 (en banc), he points out that, dur\ning the ten years preceding his armed robbery trial, Lou\nisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of\nBrady violations by prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office.6 Those\nfour reversals could not have put Connick on notice that\nthe office\u2019s Brady training was inadequate with respect to\nthe sort of Brady violation at issue here. None of those\ncases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime\nlab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.\nBecause those incidents are not similar to the violation at\nissue here, they could not have put Connick on notice that\nspecific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional\nviolation.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Thompson    had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a\npattern of similar violations, given that the jury instruction allowed\nthe jury to find deliberate indifference based on, among other things,\nprosecutors\u2019 \u201chistory of mishandling\u201d similar situations. Record 1619.\n   7 Thompson also asserts that this case is not about a \u201csingle incident\u201d\n\nbecause up to four prosecutors may have been responsible for the\nnondisclosure of the crime lab report and, according to his allegations,\nwithheld additional evidence in his armed robbery and murder trials.\nBut contemporaneous or subsequent conduct cannot establish a pattern\nof violations that would provide \u201cnotice to the cit[y] and the opportunity\nto conform to constitutional dictates . . . .\u201d Canton, 489 U.

He contends that\nthe Brady violation in his case was the \u201cobvious\u201d conse\nquence of failing to provide specific Brady training, and\nthat this showing of \u201cobviousness\u201d can substitute for the\npattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability.\n   In Canton, the Court left open the possibility that, \u201cin a\nnarrow range of circumstances,\u201d a pattern of similar viola\ntions might not be necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the\nhypothetical example of a city that arms its police force\nwith firearms and deploys the armed officers into the\npublic to capture fleeing felons without training the offi\ncers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly\nforce. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known\nfrequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing\nfelons and the \u201cpredictability that an officer lacking spe\ncific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens\u2019\nrights,\u201d the Court theorized that a city\u2019s decision not to\ntrain the officers about constitutional limits on the use of\ndeadly force could reflect the city\u2019s deliberate indifference\nto the \u201chighly predictable consequence,\u201d namely, violations\nof constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The\nCourt sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,\nthat the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train\ncould be so patently obvious that a city could be liable\nunder \u00a71983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\nviolations.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, no \n\ncourt has ever found any of the other Brady violations that Thompson\n\nalleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials. \n\n12                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations\ndoes not fall within the narrow range of Canton\u2019s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\ncific legal training that was present in the Canton scenario\nis absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split\nsecond decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is\nno reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of\ndeadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no\nway for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they\nrequire. Under those circumstances there is an obvious\nneed for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal\n\u201c[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average\npublic employees.\u201d 578 F. 3d, at 304\u2013305 (opinion of\nClement, J.).\n   Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\ntools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand\nconstitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before\nthey may enter the profession and receive a law license,\nall attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a\nsubstantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of\njurisdictions must do both. See, e.g., La. State Bar Assn.\n(LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a737,\nch. 4, App., Art. 14, \u00a77 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended\nthrough 1985). These threshold requirements are de\nsigned to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how\nto find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984) (noting\nthat the presumption \u201cthat the lawyer is competent to\nprovide the guiding hand that the defendant needs\u201d ap\nplies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their\nfirst jury trial and even when the case is complex).\n   Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most\njurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing\neducation requirements. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of In\ncorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCt. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdic\ntions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education\nrequirements mandate that attorneys represent their\nclients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in\ncontinuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule\nProf. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before\nLouisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it\nimposed similar general competency requirements on its\nstate bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1\u2013\n1, 1\u20132, DR 6\u2013101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).\n   Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in\ndistrict attorney\u2019s offices, also train on the job as they\nlearn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here\nin the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, junior\nprosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super\nvised them as they worked together to prepare cases for\ntrial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\nSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in\nstructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of\nrelevant legal developments.\n   In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy\ncharacter and fitness standards to receive a law license\nand are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to\nreinforce the profession\u2019s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 14, \u00a77 (1985); see generally\nid., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).\nTrial lawyers have a \u201cduty to bring to bear such skill and\nknowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial\ntesting process.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,\n688 (1984). Prosecutors have a special \u201cduty to seek jus\ntice, not merely to convict.\u201d LSBA, Articles of Incorpora\ntion, Art. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice 3\u20131.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors\u2019 unique\nethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence\nto the defense. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of Incorporation,\nArt. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct\n14                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n3.8(d) (1984).8 An attorney who violates his or her ethical\nobligations is subject to professional discipline, including\nsanctions, suspension, and disbarment.

Further, a prose\ncutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because\nhe believes it will damage the prosecution\u2019s case or aid the accused.\u201d\nLSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7\u201313 (1971); see also ABA\nModel Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (\u201cThe prosecutor in a criminal\ncase shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or\ninformation known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of\nthe accused or mitigates the offense . . .\u201d).\n  In addition to these ethical rules, the Louisiana Code of Criminal\nProcedure, with which Louisiana prosecutors are no doubt familiar, in\n1985 required prosecutors, upon order of the court, to permit inspection\nof evidence \u201cfavorable to the defendant . . . which [is] material and\nrelevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,\u201d La.

S., at 391. A licensed attorney making legal judg\nments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about Brady mate\nrial simply does not present the same \u201chighly predictable\u201d\nconstitutional danger as Canton\u2019s untrained officer.\n   A second significant difference between this case and\nthe example in Canton is the nuance of the allegedly\nnecessary training. The Canton hypothetical assumes\nthat the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of\nthe constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it\nis undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office\nwere familiar with the general Brady rule. Thompson\u2019s\ncomplaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an\nability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies\nthe Canton hypothetical, but rather must assert that\nprosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evi\ndence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his\ncase. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an infer\nence of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in\nCanton, \u201c[i]n virtually every instance where a person has\nhad his or her constitutional rights violated by a city\nemployee, a \u00a71983 plaintiff will be able to point to some\nthing the city \u2018could have done\u2019 to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.\u201d 489 U. S., at 392 (citing Tuttle, 471 U. S., at 823\n(plurality opinion)).\n   Thompson suggests that the absence of any formal\ntraining sessions about Brady is equivalent to the com\nplete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, see post, at 31, n. 26 (citing post,\nat 18\u201320), a prosecutor\u2019s youth is not a \u201cspecific reason\u201d not to rely on\nprofessional training and ethical obligations. See supra, at 12 (citing\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984)).\n16                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCanton. But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the\nsubstance of the training, not the particular instructional\nformat. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts\ncarte blanche to micromanage local governments through\nout the United States.\n  We do not assume that prosecutors will always make\ncorrect Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific\nBrady questions would not assist prosecutors. But show\ning merely that additional training would have been\nhelpful in making difficult decisions does not establish\nmunicipal liability. \u201c[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident\ncould have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or\nmore training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particu\nlar injury-causing conduct\u201d will not suffice. Canton, su\npra, at 391. The possibility of single-incident liability that\nthe Court left open in Canton is not this case.10\n                              2\n  The dissent rejects our holding that Canton\u2019s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter,\nencompass failure to train prosecutors in their Brady\nobligation. It would instead apply the Canton hypotheti\ncal to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion\nto explaining why the evidence supports liability under\nthat theory.11 But the dissent\u2019s attempt to address our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by\n\n\u201cdirect evidence of policymaker fault\u201d and so, presumably, did not need\nto rely on circumstantial evidence at all. Brief for Respondent 37. In\nsupport, Thompson contends that Connick created a \u201cculture of indif\nference\u201d in the district attorney\u2019s office, id., at 38, as evidenced by\nConnick\u2019s own allegedly inadequate understanding of Brady, the office\u2019s\nunwritten Brady policy that was later incorporated into a 1987 hand\nbook, and an officewide \u201crestrictive discovery policy,\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 39\u201340. This argument is essentially an assertion that Connick\u2019s\noffice had an unconstitutional policy or custom. The jury rejected this\nclaim, and Thompson does not challenge that finding.\n   11 The dissent spends considerable time finding new Brady violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nholding\u2014by pointing out that not all prosecutors will\nnecessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class\u2014\nmisses the point. See post, at 29\u201330. The reason why the\nCanton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,\nunlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nin Thompson\u2019s trials.

The dissent does not list these violations among the\n\u201c[a]bundant evidence\u201d that it believes supports the jury\u2019s finding that\nBrady training was obviously necessary. Post, at 16. Nor does the\ndissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subse\nquent conduct cannot establish a pattern of violations. The only point\nappears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic, even if\nlegally irrelevant, facts.\n   In any event, the dissent\u2019s findings are highly suspect. In finding two\nof the \u201cnew\u201d violations, the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 1998 decision that those Brady claims were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\nCompare Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806\u2013808 (CA5) (rejecting\nBrady claims regarding the Perkins-Liuzza audiotapes and the Perkins\npolice report), with post, at 8\u20139 (concluding that these were Brady\nviolations). There is no basis to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that materially\nnew facts have called the Court of Appeals\u2019 1998 decision into question.\nCf. State v. Thompson, 2002\u20130361, p. 6 (La.

As our precedent makes clear, proving that a\nmunicipality itself actually caused a constitutional viola\ntion by failing to train the offending employee presents\n\u201cdifficult problems of proof,\u201d and we must adhere to a\n\u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d lest municipal liability under\n\u00a71983 collapse into respondeat superior.12 Bryan County,\n520 U.

This is insufficient.\n  It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas\nand some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so\nobviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them\namounts to \u201ca decision by the city itself to violate the\nConstitution.\u201d Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To prove delib\nerate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick\nwas on notice that, absent additional specified training, it\nwas \u201chighly predictable\u201d that the prosecutors in his office\nwould be confounded by those gray areas and make incor\nrect Brady decisions as a result. In fact, Thompson had to\nshow that it was so predictable that failing to train the\nprosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defen\ndants\u2019 Brady rights. See Bryan Cty., 520 U.

By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried\nThompson\u2019s armed robbery case failed to carry out that\nresponsibility. But the only issue before us is whether\nConnick, as the policymaker for the district attorney\u2019s\noffice, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the\nattorneys under his authority.\n  We conclude that this case does not fall within the\n20                 CONNICK v.

I write separately only\nto address several aspects of the dissent.\n  1. The dissent\u2019s lengthy excavation of the trial record is\na puzzling exertion. The question presented for our re\nview is whether a municipality is liable for a single Brady\nviolation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern\nor practice of prior violations put the municipality on\nnotice of a need for specific training that would have pre\nvented it. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\nThat question is a legal one: whether a Brady violation\npresents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized\nin Canton\u2019s footnote 10, in which the need for training in\nconstitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the\nmunicipality\u2019s failure to provide that training amounts\nto deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390, n. 10 (1989).\n  The dissent defers consideration of this question until\npage 23 of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space\nto allegations that Connick\u2019s prosecutors misunderstood\nBrady when asked about it at trial, see post, at 16\u201318\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.), and to supposed gaps in the\nBrady guidance provided by Connick\u2019s office to prosecu\ntors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific Brady\n2                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nviolation at issue in this case) in a policy manual pub\nlished by Connick\u2019s office three years after Thompson\u2019s\ntrial, see post, at 18\u201321. None of that is relevant. Thomp\nson\u2019s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a\npervasive culture of indifference to Brady, but rather on\nthe inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of\ncriminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it\ncould find Connick deliberately indifferent if:\n       \u201cFirst: The District Attorney was certain that prosecu\n       tors would confront the situation where they would\n       have to decide which evidence was required by the\n       constitution to be provided to an accused[;]\n       \u201cSecond: The situation involved a difficult choice, or\n       one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,\n       such that additional training, supervision, or monitor\n       ing was clearly needed[; and]\n       \u201cThird: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that\n       situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an ac\n       cused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d App. 828.\n  That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the\nlaw of Monell1 in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.\nBrady mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error\nroutinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad\nwarrant; losing a Batson2 claim; crossing the line in clos\ning argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Con\nfrontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have \u201cde facto\nrespondeat superior liability,\u201d Canton, 489 U. S., at 392,\nfor each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train\nsimply because the municipality does not have a profes\nsional educational program covering the specific violation\nin sufficient depth.3 Were Thompson\u2019s theory the law,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Monell\n          v.

S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                        SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthere would have been no need for Canton\u2019s footnote to\nconfine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of\narming police officers with guns without telling them\nabout the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing\nfelons; the District Court\u2019s instructions cover every recur\nring situation in which citizens\u2019 rights can be violated.\n   That result cannot be squared with our admonition that\nfailure-to-train liability is available only in \u201climited cir\ncumstances,\u201d id., at 387, and that a pattern of consti\ntutional violations is \u201cordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability and causation,\u201d Board of Comm\u2019rs of\nBryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 409 (1997). These\nrestrictions are indispensable because without them,\n\u201cfailure to train\u201d would become a talismanic incantation\nproducing municipal liability \u201c[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights\nviolated by a city employee\u201d\u2014which is what Monell re\njects. Canton, 489 U. S., at 392. Worse, it would \u201cengage\nthe federal courts in an endless exercise of second\nguessing municipal employee-training programs,\u201d thereby\ndiminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.\nIbid.\n   2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seri\nously contend that Thompson\u2019s theory of recovery was\nproper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that\ntheory at trial. See post, at 25. The accusation is false.\nConnick\u2019s central claim was and is that failure-to-train\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nBrady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in \n\nhis underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or \n\nmonitored regarding the production of Brady evidence.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 25, \n\nn. 17 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends\nentirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to\ntraining in aspects of Brady that have been repeatedly violated, but\nincludes\u2014as the dissent would have it include here\u2014training that\nwould avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at\nall.\n4                       CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nliability for a Brady violation cannot be premised on a\nsingle incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previ\nous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary\njudgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick\noffered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge\neffectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:\n        \u201c[Connick\u2019s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition\n     in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to\n     include language that says that deliberate indiffer\n     ence to training requires a pattern of similar viola\n     tions and proof of deliberate indifference requires\n     more than a single isolated act.\n        \u201c[Thompson\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s not the law, Your\n     Honor.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: No, I\u2019m not giving that.

But in any event, to recover from a municipality\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, a plaintiff must satisfy a \u201crigor\nous\u201d standard of causation, Bryan Cty., 520 U.

It is meaningless to say that after \u201cthe court\nrejected [Connick\u2019s] categorical position,\u201d as it did, he did not \u201cassail the\nDistrict Court\u2019s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,\u201d\npost, at 26, n. 18. The prior-pattern requirement was part of Connick\u2019s\nrequested formulation of deliberate indifference: \u201cTo prove deliberate\nindifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u2018at least a pattern of similar\nviolations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be\nobviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Record, Doc.\n94, p. 18 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The\nwithholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly\ncaused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific train\ning, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan\u2019s willful\nsuppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in\nan effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan\u2019s\ncolleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to\nhim\u2014in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed\nhe had only a few months to live\u2014that he had \u201csuppressed\nblood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thomp\nson that in some way exculpated the defendant.\u201d App.\n367; see also id., at 362 (\u201c[Deegan] told me . . . that he had\nfailed to inform the defense of exculpatory information\u201d). I\nhave no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly\nsince Riehlmann\u2019s testimony hardly paints a flattering\npicture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan\u2019s\nmisconduct for another five years, as a result of which he\nincurred professional sanctions. See In re Riehlmann,\n2004\u20130680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.              And if\nRiehlmann\u2019s story is true, then the \u201cmoving force,\u201d Bryan\nCty., supra, at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbehind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a\nfailure of continuing legal education.\n  4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting\nthat with proper Brady training, \u201csurely at least one\u201d of\nthe prosecutors in Thompson\u2019s trial would have turned\nover the lab report and blood swatch. Post, at 21. But\ntraining must consist of more than mere broad encomiums\nof Brady: We have made clear that \u201cthe identified defi\nciency in a city\u2019s training program [must be] closely re\nlated to the ultimate injury.\u201d Canton, supra, at 391. So\neven indulging the dissent\u2019s assumption that Thompson\u2019s\nprosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith\u2014\nin a way that could be prevented by training\u2014what sort of\n6                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ntraining would have prevented the good-faith nondisclo\nsure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?\n   Perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate\ntraining would have prevented it. The dissent\u2019s sugges\ntion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of\nBrady limiting prosecutors\u2019 disclosure obligations to evi\ndence that is \u201cfavorable to an accused,\u201d 373 U. S., at 87.\nInstead, the dissent proposes that \u201cConnick could have\ncommunicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncer\ntain terms, that, \u2018[i]f you have physical evidence that, if\ntested, can establish the innocence of the person who is\ncharged, you have to turn it over.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 20, n. 13\n(quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training\nsuggestion, the dissent\u2019s proposal is better described as a\nsub silentio expansion of the substantive law of Brady. If\nany of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have\nnever read it, and the dissent does not cite it.5\n   Since Thompson\u2019s trial, however, we have decided a case\nthat appears to say just the opposite of the training the\ndissent would require: In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.\n51, 58 (1988), we held that \u201cunless a criminal defendant\ncan show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\npreserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a\ndenial of due process of law.\u201d We acknowledged that\n\u201cBrady . . . makes the good or bad faith of the State irrele\nvant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant\nmaterial exculpatory evidence,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 What the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an\n\nunexpected source: Connick\u2019s testimony about what qualifies as Brady\nmaterial. See post, at 20\u201321, n. 13. (\u201cOr Connick could have told\nprosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prose\ncutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the pros\necutor does not know the defendant\u2019s blood type: \u2018Under the law, it\nqualifies as Brady material.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the\ndissent has expended persuading us that Connick\u2019s understanding of\nBrady is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on\nthe subject is, to the say the least, surprising.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDue Process Clause requires a different result when we\ndeal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary\nmaterial of which no more can be said than that it could\nhave been subjected to tests, the results of which might\nhave exonerated the defendant.\u201d Id., at 57. Perhaps one\nday we will recognize a distinction between good-faith\nfailures to preserve from destruction evidence whose\ninculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and\ngood-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the de\nfense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to\nobserve that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indif\nference.\n   5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best\nkept secret of this case: There was probably no Brady\nviolation at all\u2014except for Deegan\u2019s (which, since it was a\nbad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attrib\nuted to lack of training).6 The dissent surely knows this,\nwhich is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick\nconceded that Brady was violated. I can honor that con\ncession in my analysis of the case because even if it ex\ntends beyond Deegan\u2019s deliberate actions, it remains\nirrelevant to Connick\u2019s training obligations. For any\nBrady violation apart from Deegan\u2019s was surely on the\nvery frontier of our Brady jurisprudence; Connick could\nnot possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was\nrequired to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to\nuntested evidence that we had not (and still have not)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent\u2019s only response to this is that the jury must have found\n\notherwise, since it was instructed that \u201c \u2018[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).\nBut this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not\ncommit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury\nfrom finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.\nI not only agree with that; it is part of my point.\n8                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nrecognized. As a consequence, even if I accepted the dis\nsent\u2019s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be\npremised on a single Brady error, I could not agree that\nthe lack of an accurate training regimen caused the viola\ntion Connick has conceded.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

CONNICK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ET AL., \n\n      PETITIONERS v.

Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), this\nCourt held that due process requires the prosecution to\nturn over evidence favorable to the accused and material\nto his guilt or punishment. That obligation, the parties\nhave stipulated, was dishonored in this case; conse\nquently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of\nthem isolated on death row, before the truth came to light:\nHe was innocent of the charge of attempted armed rob\nbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by\nprosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.\n  The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attor\nney\u2019s Office (District Attorney\u2019s Office or Office) cannot be\nheld liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983,\nfor the grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the\nCourt tells us, because Thompson has shown only an\naberrant Brady violation, not a routine practice of giving\nshort shrift to Brady\u2019s requirements. The evidence pre\nsented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thomp\nson, however, points distinctly away from the Court\u2019s\nassessment. As the trial record in the \u00a71983 action re\nveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial trans\ngressions were neither isolated nor atypical.\n  From the top down, the evidence showed, members of\n2                  CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe District Attorney\u2019s Office, including the District At\ntorney himself, misperceived Brady\u2019s compass and there\nfore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.\nThroughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against\nThompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him\nfor armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and\nthe court exculpatory information Thompson requested\nand had a constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors\ndid so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two\ndecades, to set the record straight. Based on the prosecu\ntors\u2019 conduct relating to Thompson\u2019s trials, a fact trier\ncould reasonably conclude that inattention to Brady was\nstandard operating procedure at the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice.\n   What happened here, the Court\u2019s opinion obscures, was\nno momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone offi\ncer\u2019s misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that\nmisperception and disregard of Brady\u2019s disclosure re\nquirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evi\ndence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately\nindifferent conduct for which the District Attorney\u2019s Office\nbears responsibility under \u00a71983.\n   I dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment mindful that Brady\nviolations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected.\nBut for a chance discovery made by a defense team inves\ntigator weeks before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, the\nevidence that led to his exoneration might have remained\nunder wraps. The prosecutorial concealment Thompson\nencountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless\nmunicipal agencies bear responsibility\u2014made tangible by\n\u00a71983 liability\u2014for adequately conveying what Brady\nrequires and for monitoring staff compliance. Failure to\ntrain, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liabil\nity under \u00a71983 \u201cwhere the failure . . . amounts to deliber\nate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the\n[untrained employees] come into contact.\u201d Canton v.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

That standard is well\nmet in this case.\n                              I\n   I turn first to a contextual account of the Brady viola\ntions that infected Thompson\u2019s trials.\n                              A\n  In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an\nassailant shot and killed Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., son of a\nprominent New Orleans business executive, on the street\nfronting the victim\u2019s home. Only one witness saw the\nassailant. As recorded in two contemporaneous police\nreports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant\nas African-American, six feet tall, with \u201cclose cut hair.\u201d\nRecord EX2\u2013EX3, EX9.1 Thompson is five feet eight\ninches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair\nin a large \u201cAfro.\u201d Id., at EX13. The police reports of the\nwitness\u2019 immediate identification were not disclosed to\nThompson or to the court.\n  While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans\nParish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent\ncrime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an\nassailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.\nDuring the struggle, the perpetrator\u2019s blood stained the\noldest child\u2019s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch\nof fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,\nwas eventually tested. The test conclusively established\nthat the perpetrator\u2019s blood was type B. Id., at EX151.\nThompson\u2019s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to\ndisclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Exhibits entered into evidence in Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983 trial are herein\n\ncited by reference to the page number in the exhibit binder compiled by\nthe District Court and included in the record on appeal.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n  One month after the Liuzza murder, Richard Perkins, a\nman who knew Thompson, approached the Liuzza family.\nPerkins did so after the family\u2019s announcement of a\n$15,000 reward for information leading to the murderer\u2019s\nconviction. Police officers surreptitiously recorded the\nPerkins-Liuzza conversations.2 As documented on tape,\nPerkins told the family, \u201cI don\u2019t mind helping [you] catch\n[the perpetrator], . . . but I would like [you] to help me\nand, you know, I\u2019ll help [you].\u201d Id., at EX479, EX481.\nOnce the family assured Perkins, \u201cwe\u2019re on your side, we\nwant to try and help you,\u201d id., at EX481, Perkins inti\nmated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman,\nhad been involved in Liuzza\u2019s murder. Perkins thereafter\ntold the police what he had learned from Freeman about\nthe murder, and that information was recorded in a police\nreport. Based on Perkins\u2019 account, Thompson and Free\nman were arrested on murder charges.\n  Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name \u201cKojak\u201d\nbecause he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp\nwas visible. Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewit\nness\u2019 initial description of the Liuzza assailant\u2019s height\nand hair style. As the Court notes, ante, at 4, n. 2, Free\nman became the key witness for the prosecution at\nThompson\u2019s trial for the murder of Liuzza.\n  After Thompson\u2019s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the\nfather of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper\nphoto of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Themajority endorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that, when\nThompson was tried for murder, no Brady violation occurred with\nrespect to these audio tapes \u201c[b]ecause defense counsel had knowledge\nof such evidence and could easily have requested access from the\nprosecution.\u201d Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806\u2013807 (1998); ante,\nat 17, n. 11. The basis for that asserted \u201cknowledge\u201d is a mystery. The\nrecordings secretly made did not come to light until long after Thomp\nson\u2019s trials.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

He reported to the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice that the children had identified Thompson as their\nattacker, and the children then picked that same photo\nout of a \u201cphotographic lineup.\u201d Record EX120, EX642\u2013\nEX643. Indicting Thompson on the basis of these ques\ntionable identifications, the District Attorney\u2019s Office did\nnot pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpe\ntrator\u2019s blood. This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecu\ntor\u2019s notation that the Office \u201cmay wish to do [a] blood\ntest.\u201d Id., at EX122.\n   The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March\n1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson\nfor robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic\nchoice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceed\ning first on the robbery indictment. Id., at EX128\u2013EX129.\nTheir aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first\nwould serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his\nown defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction\ncould be used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an\narmed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty\nphase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution\u2019s\nplea for the death penalty. Id., at 682.\n   Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,\npetitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the\nParish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric\nDubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases. Dubelier\nenlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to\nassist him in the murder case. Gerry Deegan assisted\nWilliams in the armed robbery case. Bruce Whittaker, the\nfourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved\nThompson\u2019s armed robbery indictment.3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 At the time of their assignment, Dubelier had served in the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office for three and a half years, Williams, for four and a\nhalf years, Deegan, a recent law school graduate, for less than one year,\nand Whittaker, for three years.\n6                      CONNICK v.

Prosecutorial re\nsponses to this motion fell far short of Brady compliance.4\n   First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel\u2019s inspection of\nthe pant leg swatch stained by the robber\u2019s blood. Al\nthough Dubelier\u2019s April 3 response stated, \u201cInspection to\nbe permitted,\u201d id., at EX149, the swatch was signed out\nfrom the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and\nwas not returned until noon on April 10, the day before\ntrial, id., at EX43, EX670. Thompson\u2019s attorney inspected\nthe evidence made available to him and found no blood\nevidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch\nand its recent removal from the property room.

But cf. ante, at 17, n. 11\n(Thompson\u2019s attorney had \u201caccess to the evidence locker\nwhere the swatch was recorded as evidence.\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Connick did not dispute that failure to disclose the swatch and the\n\ncrime lab report violated Brady.

THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmurder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution\u2019s\norder-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.7 By prosecuting\nThompson for armed robbery first\u2014and withholding blood\nevidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that\ncharge\u2014the District Attorney\u2019s Office disabled Thompson\nfrom testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.8 As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5, impeaching use of the\nprior conviction would have severely undermined Thomp\nson\u2019s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively\nstopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony\nof the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecu\ntion\u2019s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached\nthose witnesses helped to seal Thompson\u2019s fate.\n   First, the prosecution undermined Thompson\u2019s efforts to\nimpeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered\ninformation to the police with no knowledge of reward\nmoney. Record EX366, EX372\u2013EX373. Because prosecu\ntors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins\u2019 conversa\ntions with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the\ntapes), Thompson\u2019s attorneys could do little to cast doubt\non Perkins\u2019 credibility. In closing argument, the prosecu\ntion emphasized that Thompson presented no \u201cdirect\nevidence\u201d that reward money had motivated any of the\nwitnesses. Id., at EX3171\u2013EX3172.\n   Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson\u2019s impeach\nment of key witness Kevin Freeman. It did so by failing to\ndisclose a police report containing Perkins\u2019 account of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 During jury deliberations in the armed robbery case, Williams, the\n\nonly Orleans Parish trial attorney common to the two prosecutions, told\nThompson of his objective in no uncertain terms: \u201cI\u2019m going to fry you.\nYou will die in the electric chair.\u201d Tr. 252\u2013253.\n  8 The Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded, and Connick does not\n\ndispute, that Thompson \u201cwould have testified in the absence of the\nattempted armed robbery conviction.\u201d State v.

Lacking any knowledge of the police\nreport, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.\n   Third, and most vital, the eyewitness\u2019 initial description\nof the assailant\u2019s hair, see supra, at 3, was of prime rele\nvance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson,\nmurdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the\neyewitness\u2019 contemporaneous description of the murderer\nshould have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.\nFailure to produce the police reports setting out what the\neyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im\npeach that witness and the police officer who initially\ninterviewed him. The omission left defense counsel with\nout knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the\nkiller\u2019s \u201cclose cut hair\u201d into an \u201cAfro.\u201d\n   Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eye\nwitness\u2019 initial description and Thompson\u2019s appearance.\nThey asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to\nagree on the stand that the perpetrator\u2019s hair was \u201cafro\ntype,\u201d yet \u201cstraight back.\u201d Record EX322\u2013EX323.

As\nprosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police\nreports, which described the murderer\u2019s hair simply as\n\u201cclose cut,\u201d portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro\nstyle hair.\n   The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.\nHaving prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman\nwas the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate\nargument.

The strategy worked as planned; Thomp\nson was sentenced to death.\n                             E\n   Thompson discovered the prosecutors\u2019 misconduct\nthrough a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine\nyears after Thompson\u2019s convictions, Deegan, the assistant\nprosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was\nterminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his\nfriend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood\nevidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.\nDeegan did not heed Riehlmann\u2019s counsel to reveal what\nhe had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former\nOrleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan\u2019s confession to\nhimself. Id., at EX712\u2013EX713.\n   On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled\nThompson\u2019s execution. Id., at EX1366\u2013EX1367. In an\neleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson\u2019s attorneys\nhired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab ar\nchives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the\nlab report identifying the robber\u2019s blood type. The copy\nshowed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.\nSee supra, at 7.         Thompson\u2019s attorneys contacted\nWhittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report\nhad been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker\nthat Deegan \u201chad failed to turn over stuff that might have\nbeen exculpatory.\u201d Tr. 718.

A full hearing\nwas unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con\nfessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery\ncharges. See, e.g., id., at EX617. The court insisted on a\npublic hearing. Given \u201cthe history of this case,\u201d the court\nsaid, it \u201cwas not willing to accept the representations that\n[Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dis\nmiss].\u201d id., at EX882. After a full day\u2019s hearing, the court\nvacated Thompson\u2019s attempted armed robbery conviction\nand dismissed the charges.

In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of\nAppeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s earlier assessment\nof those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161\nF. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp\nson was \u201cbelatedly tr[ying] to reverse\u201d the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision. But\ncf. ante, at 17, n. 11.\n   10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re\n\njected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those\nclaims as \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161\nF. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the\ndate of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of\nthe Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had\nthe opportunity for discovery in his \u00a71983 suit, and before Thompson or\nany court was aware of the \u201cclose cut hair\u201d police reports. See Thomp\nson, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little\nThompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth\nCircuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins\u2019 statement recorded in the police\nreport did not \u201cdiffer from Freeman\u2019s trial testimony.\u201d Id., at 808. But\nevidence put before the jury in 2007 in the \u00a71983 trial showed that the\npolice report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with\nFreeman\u2019s trial testimony. Tr. 382\u2013383.\n   Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the \u00a71983\ntrial was bound by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s 1998 Brady rulings. That court\n\u201cafford[ed] great deference to\u201d the state trial court\u2019s findings, made\nafter a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at\n805. The jury in the \u00a71983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and\naccurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The newly\nproduced items included police reports describing the\nassailant in the murder case as having \u201cclose cut\u201d hair, the\npolice report recounting Perkins\u2019 meetings with the Liuzza\nfamily, see supra, at 3\u20134, audio recordings of those meet\nings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After\ndeliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson\nnot guilty.\n  On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years\nin prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was\nreleased.\n                              II\n   On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 alleging that Connick, other\nofficials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office,\nand the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights\nby wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson\nsought to hold Connick and the District Attorney\u2019s Office\nliable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern\ning their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I\nagree with the Court, only when the failure \u201camount[s] to\n\u2018deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom\nthe [untrained employees] come into contact.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9\n(quoting Canton v.

See supra, at\n10\u201311. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that\nassessed Connick\u2019s deliberate indifference in the \u00a71983 trial to defer to\nfindings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.\n14                 CONNICK v.

Record 1917.\n   Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality\u2019s\nfailure to provide training may be so egregious that, even\nwithout notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure\n\u201ccould properly be characterized as \u2018deliberate indiffer\nence\u2019 to constitutional rights.\u201d Canton, 489 U.

Ante, at 5.\n  The jury found, however, that Connick was deliberately\nindifferent to the need to train prosecutors about Brady\u2019s\ncommand. On the special verdict form, the jury answered\nyes to the following question:\n     \u201cWas the Brady violation in the armed robbery case or\n     any infringements of John Thompson\u2019s rights in the\n     murder trial substantially caused by [Connick\u2019s] fail\n     ure, through deliberate indifference, to establish poli\n     cies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime\n     from these constitutional violations?\u201d Record 1585.\n  Consistent with the question put to the jury, and with\nout objection, the court instructed the jurors: \u201c[Y]ou are\nnot limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the\nresulting infringement of Mr. Thompson\u2019s right to testify\nat the murder trial. You may consider all of the evidence\npresented during this trial.\u201d Tr. 1099; Record 1620.11 But\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The   court permitted Thompson to introduce evidence of other\nBrady violations, but because \u201cthe blood evidence alone proved the\nviolation [of Thompson\u2019s constitutional rights],\u201d the court declined\nspecifically \u201cto ask the jury [whether] this other stuff [was] also Brady.\u201d\nTr. 1003.

But cf.\nante, at 17, n. 11 (questioning how \u201cthese violations are relevant\u201d to\nthis case). Far from indulging in my own factfindings, but cf. ante, at\n16\u201317, n. 11, I simply recite the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict\nin Thompson\u2019s \u00a71983 trial.\n   The Court misleadingly states that \u201cthe District Court instructed the\njury that the \u2018only issue\u2019 was whether the nondisclosure [of the crime\nlab report] was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the dis\ntrict attorney\u2019s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the\noffice\u2019s prosecutors.\u201d Ante, at 4. The jury instruction the majority cites\nsimply directed the jury that, with regard to the blood evidence, as a\nmatter of law, Thompson\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\nRecord 1614\u20131615.

That evidence included a stipulation that in his\nretrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced\nten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by\nthe prosecution in 1985. See supra, at 13.\n   Abundant evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that\nadditional Brady training was obviously necessary to\nensure that Brady violations would not occur: (1) Connick,\nthe Office\u2019s sole policymaker, misunderstood Brady. (2)\nOther leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility\nfor training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly\nuninformed about Brady. (3) Prosecutors in the Office\nreceived no Brady training. (4) The Office shirked its\nresponsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal\ndevelopments concerning Brady requirements. As a result\nof these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that\nBrady violations in fact occurred, severely undermining\nthe integrity of Thompson\u2019s trials.\n                             1\n  Connick was the Office\u2019s sole policymaker, and his\ntestimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecu\ntor\u2019s Brady obligations.

Those misun\nderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part re\nsponsible for the gross disregard of Brady rights Thomp\nson experienced.       Dubelier admitted that he never\nreviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag\nany potential Brady information. Tr. 542. The court,\nhowever, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor\nhas a \u201cduty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known\nto others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case,\nincluding the police.\u201d Id., at 1095; Record 1614.

Tr. 419, 426. Lawless has practiced criminal law for 30\nyears; from 1976 to 1979, he was an assistant district attorney, and\nthereafter he entered private practice. Id., at 412. He is the author of\nProsecutorial Misconduct: Law, Procedure, Forms (4th ed. 2008), first\npublished in 1985. Tr. 414.

But\ncf. ante, at 4\u20135 (\u201c[I]t was undisputed at trial that the\nprosecutors were familiar with the general Brady re\nquirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence\nin its possession that is favorable to the accused.\u201d).\n   The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\u2019s\nrights directly to prosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady.\nThe prosecution had no obligation to produce the \u201cclose-cut\nhair\u201d police reports, Williams maintained, because news\npaper reports had suggested that witness descrip\ntions were not consistent with Thompson\u2019s appearance.\nTherefore, Williams urged, the defense already \u201chad every\nthing.\u201d Tr. 139. Dubelier tendered an alternative ex\nplanation for the nondisclosure. In Dubelier\u2019s view, the\ndescriptions were not \u201cinconsistent with [Thompson\u2019s]\nappearance,\u201d as portrayed in a police photograph showing\nThompson\u2019s hair extending at least three inches above his\nforehead. Id., at 171\u2013172; Record EX73. Williams in\nsisted that he had discharged the prosecution\u2019s duty to\ndisclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion\nhearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood\nsample from Thompson. Tr. 393\u2013394. During the armed\nrobbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the\nresults of the blood test made on the swatch had been\n\u201cinconclusive.\u201d Id., at 962. And he testified in the \u00a71983\naction that the lab report was not Brady material \u201cbecause\nI didn\u2019t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.\u201d\nTr. 393.

In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that\nBrady training in his Office was inadequate. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 60. Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors\u2019\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

But the jury\nheard ample evidence that Connick\u2019s Office gave prosecu\ntors no Brady guidance, and had installed no procedures\nto monitor Brady compliance.\n  In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors\n\u201cwere coming fresh out of law school,\u201d and the Office\u2019s\n\u201c[h]uge turnover\u201d allowed attorneys with little experience\nto advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853\u2013\n854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the\nhighest ranking attorneys in the Office, id., at 342, 356\u2013\n357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as\na prosecutor, see supra, at 5, n. 3; Record EX746; Tr. 55,\n571\u2013576.\n  Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in\nConnick\u2019s Office, and, as earlier observed, see supra, at\n17\u201318, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient\nunderstanding of Brady. Dubelier and Williams told the\njury that they did not recall any Brady training in the\nOffice. Tr. 170\u2013171, 364.\n  Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, includ\ning Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were\nfamiliar with their Brady obligations. Tr. 805\u2013806. Yet\nConnick did not inquire whether the supervisors them\nselves understood the importance of teaching newer prose\ncutors about Brady. Riehlmann could not \u201crecall that [he]\nwas ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his]\nBrady obligations,\u201d on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728\u2013729.\nWhittaker agreed it was possible for \u201cinexperienced law\nyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,\u201d\nto bear responsibility for \u201cdecisions on . . . whether mate\nrial was Brady material and had to be produced.\u201d Id., at\n319.\n  Thompson\u2019s expert characterized Connick\u2019s supervision\nregarding Brady as \u201cthe blind leading the blind.\u201d Tr. 458.\n20                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, in 1985 trial attorneys \u201csometimes . . . went\nto Mr. Connick\u201d with Brady questions, \u201cand he would tell\nthem\u201d how to proceed. Tr. 892. But Connick acknowl\nedged that he had \u201cstopped reading law books . . . and\nlooking at opinions\u201d when he was first elected District\nAttorney in 1974. Id., at 175\u2013176.\n   As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly at\ntended a pretrial conference with the Office\u2019s chief of trials\nbefore taking a case to trial. Connick intended the prac\ntice to provide both training and accountability. But it\nachieved neither aim in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions, for\nDubelier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office,\nwere free to take cases to trial without pretrying them,\nand that is just how they proceeded in Thompson\u2019s prose\ncutions. Id., at 901\u2013902; Record 685. But cf. ante, at 13\n(\u201c[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\u201d).\n   Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District\nAttorney\u2019s Office, overall, was deficient. Soon after Con\nnick retired, a survey of assistant district attorneys in the\nOffice revealed that more than half felt that they had not\nreceived the training they needed to do their jobs. Tr. 178.\n   Thompson, it bears emphasis, is not complaining about\nthe absence of formal training sessions. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n55. But cf. ante, at 15\u201316. His complaint does not demand\nthat Brady compliance be enforced in any particular way.\nHe asks only that Brady obligations be communicated\naccurately and genuinely enforced.13 Because that did not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 To ward off Brady violations of the kind Connick conceded, for ex\n\nample, Connick could have communicated to Orleans Parish prosecu\ntors, in no uncertain terms, that, \u201c[i]f you have physical evidence that,\nif tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you\nhave to turn it over.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 34; id., at 36 (\u201c[I]f you have\nevidence that can conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the\ninnocence of the person being charged, you have to turn it over . . . .\u201d).\nOr Connick could have told prosecutors what he told the jury when he\nwas asked whether a prosecutor must disclose a crime lab report to the\ndefense, even if the prosecutor does not know the defendant\u2019s blood\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Had Brady\u2019s\nimportance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at\nleast one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and\nlab report would have revealed their existence to defense\ncounsel and the court.14\n                              4\n  Louisiana did not require continuing legal education at\nthe time of Thompson\u2019s trials. Tr. 361. But cf. ante, at\n12\u201313. Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors au\ncourant with developments in the law, therefore, resided\nin the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Over the course of Con\nnick\u2019s tenure as District Attorney, the jury learned, the\nOffice\u2019s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when ap\npellate courts issued important opinions. Tr. 751\u2013754,\n798.\n  The 1987 Office policy manual was a compilation of\nmemoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to\nprosecutors from 1974, when Connick became District\nAttorney, through 1987. Id., at 798. The manual con\ntained four sentences, nothing more, on Brady.15 This\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntype: \u201cUnder the law it qualifies as Brady material. Under Louisiana\nlaw we must turn that over. Under Brady we must turn that over. I\n[failed to disclose a crime lab report] one time as a prosecutor and I got\nindicted by the U. S. Attorney over here for doing it.\u201d Tr. 872. But cf.\nante, at 7 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (questioning how Connick could have\nbeen on notice of the need to train prosecutors about the Brady viola\ntions conceded in this case).\n   14 The Court can scarcely disagree with respect to Dubelier, Williams,\n\nand Whittaker, for it acknowledges the \u201cflagran[cy]\u201d of Deegan\u2019s con\nduct, see ante, at 7, n. 5, and does not dispute that, pretrial, other\nprosecutors knew of the existence of the swatch and lab report.\n   15 Section 5.25 of the manual, titled \u201cBrady Material,\u201d states in full:\n\n\u201cIn most cases, in response to the request of defense attorneys, the\nJudge orders the State to produce so called Brady material\u2014that is,\ninformation in the possession of the State which is exculpatory regard\ning the defendant.

But cf.\nante, at 13 (\u201cSenior attorneys also circulated court deci\nsions and instructional memoranda to keep the prose\ncutors abreast of relevant legal developments.\u201d). For\nexample, the manual did not acknowledge what Giglio v.\nUnited States, 405 U.

Failure to produce\nBrady material has resulted in mistrials and reversals, as well as\nextended court battles over jeopardy issues. In all cases, a review of\nBrady issues, including apparently self-serving statements made by the\ndefendant, must be included in a pre-trial conference and each Assis\ntant must be familiar with the law regarding exculpatory information\npossessed by the State.\u201d Record EX427.\n   16 During the relevant time period, there were many significant de\n\nvelopments in this Court\u2019s Brady jurisprudence. Among the Brady\nrelated decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (\u201cThis Court has rejected any . . . distinction\nbetween impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady\ncontext].\u201d); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559\u2013560 (1977)\n(\u201cBrady is not implicated . . . where the only claim is that the State\nshould have revealed that it would present the eyewitness testimony of\na particular agent against the defendant at trial.\u201d); and United States v.\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103, 104, 106\u2013107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise\nwhen \u201cthe undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution\u2019s\ncase includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or\nshould have known, of the perjury,\u201d when defense counsel makes \u201ca\npretrial request for specific evidence\u201d and the government fails to\naccede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and\nthe government fails to disclose \u201cobviously exculpatory\u201d evidence).\nThese decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled\ncirculated memoranda.\n   In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of\nopinions discussing Brady, including State v.

First, Connick did not ensure that\nprosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he\nneither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he\nhired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his\nwatch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor\ning was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,\nConnick\u2019s cavalier approach to his staff\u2019s knowledge and\nobservation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul\nture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an\neffort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli\nance because he felt the effort would \u201cmake [his] job more\ndifficult.\u201d Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single\nprosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182\u2013183. The jury was\ntold of this Court\u2019s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick\u2019s Office\nthat garnered attention because it featured \u201cso many\ninstances of the state\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory\nevidence.\u201d Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When\nquestioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was\nsatisfied with his Office\u2019s practices and saw no need,\noccasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184\u2013185.\nIn both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed\nhere was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi\nnation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under\nhim were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,\nthey were deliberately indifferent to what the law\nrequires.\n                           B\n  In Canton, this Court spoke of circumstances in which\nthe need for training may be \u201cso obvious,\u201d and the lack of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nprosecution fails, even inadvertently, to disclose bargain with a wit\nness).\n\n24                    CONNICK v.

S., at\n390. This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category\nCanton marked out.\n   Canton offered an often-cited illustration. \u201c[C]ity poli\ncymakers know to a moral certainty that their police\nofficers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.\u201d Ibid.,\nn. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police\nofficers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The\nneed to instruct armed officers about \u201cconstitutional limi\ntations on the use of deadly force,\u201d Canton said, is \u201c \u2018so\nobvious,\u2019 that failure to [train the officers] could properly\nbe characterized as \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to constitu\ntional rights.\u201d Ibid.\n   The District Court, tracking Canton\u2019s language, in\nstructed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his\n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d claim only if the evidence per\nsuaded the jury on three points. First, Connick \u201cwas\ncertain that prosecutors would confront the situation\nwhere they would have to decide which evidence was\nrequired by the Constitution to be provided to the ac\ncused.\u201d Tr. 1099. Second, \u201cthe situation involved a diffi\ncult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of\nmishandling, such that additional training, supervision or\nmonitoring was clearly needed.\u201d Ibid. Third, \u201cthe wrong\nchoice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently\ncause a deprivation of an accused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d\nIbid.; Record 1619\u20131620; see Canton, 489 U.

See, e.g., Tr. 1100 (\u201cMr. Thompson must prove that more\nlikely than not the Brady material would have been produced if the\nprosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly\ntrained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of Brady\nevidence.\u201d). See also id., at 1096\u20131097, 1099\u20131100.\n   The deliberate indifference jury instruction in this case was based on\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in Walker v.

See Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10.19 As\ndemonstrated earlier, see supra, at 16\u201318, even at trial\nprosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their\nBrady obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see\nsupra, at 18\u201320, the evidence permitted the jury to con\nclude that Connick should have known Brady training in\nhis office bordered on \u201czero.\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\nMoreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors\nneeded \u201cvery clear\u201d guidance and should not be left to\ngrapple with Brady on their own.

It was\nthus \u201cobvious\u201d to him, the jury could find, that constitu\ntional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received\nslim to no Brady training.\n   Based on the evidence presented, the jury could con\nclude that Brady errors by untrained prosecutors would\nfrequently cause deprivations of defendants\u2019 constitutional\nrights.

They were just what one would expect given the\nattitude toward Brady pervasive in the District Attorney\u2019s\nOffice. Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five\nprosecutors\u2014the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann\u2014\ndisregarded his Brady rights. He established that they\nkept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his de\nfense. Their conduct, he showed with equal force, was a\nforeseeable consequence of lax training in, and absence of\nmonitoring of, a legal requirement fundamental to a fair\ntrial.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 The jury could draw a direct, causal connection between Connick\u2019s\n\ndeliberate indifference, prosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady, and the\nBrady violations in Thompson\u2019s case. See, e.g., supra, at 17 (prosecu\ntors\u2019 misunderstandings of Brady \u201cwere in large part responsible for the\ngross disregard of Brady rights Thompson experienced\u201d); supra, at 18\n(\u201cThe jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\u2019s rights directly to\nprosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of Brady.\u201d); supra, at 17\u201318 (Williams did\nnot believe Brady required disclosure of impeachment evidence and did\nnot believe he had any obligation to turn over the impeaching \u201cclose-cut\nhair\u201d police reports); supra, at 18 (At the time of the armed robbery\ntrial, Williams reported that the results of the blood test on the swatch\nwere \u201cinconclusive\u201d); ibid.

But cf. ante, at 7, n. 5 (\u201cThe dissent believes that evidence\nthat the prosecutors allegedly \u2018misapprehen[ded]\u2019 Brady proves causa\ntion.\u201d).\n   I note, furthermore, that the jury received clear instructions on the\ncausation element, and neither Connick nor the majority disputes the\naccuracy or adequacy of the instruction that, to prevail, Thompson\nmust prove \u201cthat more likely than not the Brady material would have\nbeen produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal\ncases had been properly trained, supervised or monitored regarding the\nproduction of Brady evidence.\u201d Tr. 1100.\n   The jury was properly instructed that \u201c[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.\u201d Id., at 1098. Under that instruction, in\nfinding Connick liable, the jury necessarily rejected the argument\u2014\nechoed by JUSTICE SCALIA\u2014that Deegan \u201cwas the only bad guy.\u201d Id., at\n1074. See also id., at 1057; ante, at 5. If indeed Thompson had shown\nsimply and only that Deegan deliberately withheld evidence, I would\nagree that there would be no basis for liability. But, as reams of\nevidence showed, disregard of Brady occurred, over and over again in\nOrleans Parish, before, during, and after Thompson\u2019s 1985 robbery and\nmurder trials.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                 29\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nent\u201d to the risk to innocent lives.\n   Brady, this Court has long recognized, is among the\nmost basic safeguards brigading a criminal defendant\u2019s\nfair trial right. See Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 1). See also United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S.\n667, 695 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Vigilance in\nsuperintending prosecutors\u2019 attention to Brady\u2019s require\nment is all the more important for this reason: A Brady\nviolation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence\nbeyond the defendant\u2019s capacity to ferret out. Because the\nabsence of the withheld evidence may result in the convic\ntion of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to\nimpose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring\nthe information to light.\n   The Court nevertheless holds Canton\u2019s example inappo\nsite. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics\nrules, and training\u2014including on-the-job training\u2014set\nattorneys apart from other municipal employees, including\nrookie police officers. Ante, at 12\u201315. Connick \u201chad every\nincentive at trial to attempt to establish\u201d that he could\nreasonably rely on the professional education and status of\nhis staff. Cf. ante, at 10, n. 6. But the jury heard and\nrejected his argument to that effect. Tr. 364, 576\u2013577,\n834\u2013835.\n   The Court advances Connick\u2019s argument with greater\nclarity, but with no greater support. On what basis can\none be confident that law schools acquaint students with\nprosecutors\u2019 unique obligation under Brady? Whittaker\ntold the jury he did not recall covering Brady in his crimi\nnal procedure class in law school. Tr. 335. Dubelier\u2019s\nalma mater, like most other law faculties, does not make\ncriminal procedure a required course.21\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 See Tulane University Law School, Curriculum, http://www.law\n\n.tulane.edu (select \u201cAcademics\u201d; select \u201cCurriculum\u201d) (as visited Mar.\n21, 2011, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n30                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Connick suggested that the bar examination ensures\nthat new attorneys will know what Brady demands. Tr.\n835. Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the\npresent, Brady questions have not accounted for even\n10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure\nsection of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Exami\nnation.22 A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examina\ntion, moreover, need pass only five of the exam\u2019s nine\nsections.23 One can qualify for admission to the profession\nwith no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal\nlaw and procedure.\n   The majority\u2019s suggestion that lawyers do not need\nBrady training because they \u201care equipped with the tools\nto find, interpret, and apply legal principles,\u201d ante, at 17\u2013\n18, \u201cblinks reality\u201d and is belied by the facts of this case.\nSee Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and\nProsecutors as Amici Curiae 13. Connick himself recog\nnized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience,\nwere not so equipped. Indeed, \u201cunderstanding and com\nplying with Brady obligations are not easy tasks, and the\nappropriate way to resolve Brady issues is not always self\nevident.\u201d Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials\nand Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 6. \u201cBrady compliance,\u201d\ntherefore, \u201cis too much at risk, and too fundamental to the\nfairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for\ngranted,\u201d and \u201ctraining remains critical.\u201d Id., at 3, 7.\n   The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations is necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence to defendants\u2019 Brady rights.

Con\nducting this inquiry, the Court has acknowledged, \u201cmay not be an easy\ntask for the factfinder.\u201d Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 391 (1989).\nBryan County did not retreat from this Court\u2019s conclusion in Canton\nthat \u201cjudge and jury, doing their respective jobs, will be adequate to the\ntask.\u201d 489 U. S., at 391. See also Bryan County, 520 U. S., at 410\n(absent a pattern, municipal liability may be predicated on \u201ca particu\nlar glaring omission in a training regimen\u201d). But cf. ante, at 16\u201318\n(suggesting that under no set of facts could a plaintiff establish deliber\nate indifference for failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligation\nwithout showing a prior pattern of violations).\n    25 When Congress sought to render a claim for relief contingent on\n\nshowing a pattern or practice, it did so expressly. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a714141(a) (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any governmental authority . . . to\nengage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\n. . . that deprives persons of rights . . . protected by the Constitution\n. . . .\u201d); 15 U. S. C. \u00a76104(a) (\u201cAny person adversely affected by any\npattern or practice of telemarketing . . . may . . . bring a civil action\n. . . .\u201d); 49 U. S. C. \u00a7306(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to bring a\ncivil action when he \u201chas reason to believe that a person is engaged in a\npattern or practice [of] violating this section\u201d). See also 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7532(e)(2)\u2013(3) (authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to\nestablish additional rules when \u201cthe Commission finds that the prior\nadjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of\nviolations\u201d).\n    26 In the end, the majority leaves open the possibility that something\n\nother than \u201ca pattern of violations\u201d could also give a district attorney\n\u201cspecific reason\u201d to know that additional training is necessary. See\nante, at 14\u201315. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See\nsupra, at 18\u201320.\n    27 For example, a prosecutor\u2019s office could be deliberately indifferent if\n\nit had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed\nto provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their Brady\nobligations in the altered circumstances. Or a district attorney could be\ndeliberately indifferent if he had a practice of paring well-trained\nprosecutors with untrained prosecutors, knew that such supervision\n32                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncase is one such instance. Connick, who himself had been\nindicted for suppression of evidence, created a tinderbox in\nOrleans Parish in which Brady violations were nigh inevi\ntable. And when they did occur, Connick insisted there\nwas no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to\nhold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so\nwould make his job more difficult.\n   A District Attorney aware of his office\u2019s high turnover\nrate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and\npromotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsi\nbility for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place. In\nshort, the buck stops with him.28 As the Court recognizes,\n\u201cthe duty to produce Brady evidence to the defense\u201d is\n\u201c[a]mong prosecutors\u2019 unique ethical obligations.\u201d Ante, at\n13. The evidence in this case presents overwhelming\nsupport for the conclusion that the Orleans Parish Office\nslighted its responsibility to the profession and to the\nState\u2019s system of justice by providing no on-the-job Brady\ntraining. Connick was not \u201centitled to rely on prosecutors\u2019\nprofessional training,\u201d ante, at 14, for Connick himself\nshould have been the principal insurer of that training.\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe U.

Canton recognized that deliberate indifference\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same.\n489 U. S., at 385, 388\u2013389. Connick was directly responsible for the\nBrady violations in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions not because he hired\nprosecutors who violated Brady, but because of his own deliberate\nindifference.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.
