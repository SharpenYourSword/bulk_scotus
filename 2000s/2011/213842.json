PINHOLSTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131088. Argued November 9, 2010\u2014Decided April 4, 2011\nA California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first\n  degree murder. At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prose\n  cution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster\u2019s his\n  tory of threatening and violent behavior. Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel,\n  who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the\n  ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice\n  under California law, called only Pinholster\u2019s mother. Counsel did\n  not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg,\n  who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.\n  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sen\n  tenced to death. Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the Califor\n  nia Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had\n  failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence dur\n  ing the penalty phase. He introduced additional evidence to support\n  his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from\n  family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychia\n  trist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure dis\n  orders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg\u2019s report. Each time, the State\n  Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the\n  merits. Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary\n  hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28\n  U. S. C. \u00a72254. Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the\n  new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the\n  State Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable applica\n  tion of . . . clearly established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before\n the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pp. 8\u201314.\n2                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\n    alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a72254 sets several limits on a federal\n    court\u2019s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant\n    here, a claim that has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court\n    proceedings,\u201d \u201cshall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication\u201d \u201c(1)\n    resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason\n    able application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d or \u201c(2) resulted\n    in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n    facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\n    \u00a72254(d). This \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n    ___, ___, and \u201c \u2018highly deferential standard\u2019 . . . demands that state\n    court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Woodford v. Vis\n    ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24. Section 2254(d)(1)\u2019s backward-looking lan\n    guage\u2014\u201cresulted in\u201d and \u201cinvolved\u201d\u2014requires an examination of the\n    state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re\n    cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that\n    same time\u2014i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com\n    pelled by \u201cthe broader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d which dem\n    onstrates Congress\u2019 intent to channel prisoners\u2019 claims first to state\n    courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. It is also con\n    sistent with this Court\u2019s precedents, which emphasize that\n    \u00a72254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,\n    e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372. Moreover, it is consis\n    tent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained\n    that a federal habeas court is \u201cnot required to hold an evidentiary\n    hearing\u201d when the state-court record \u201cprecludes habeas relief\u201d under\n    \u00a72254(d)\u2019s limitations. The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil\n    liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649,\n    as supporting the contrary view. Pp. 8\u201312.\n          (b) This holding does not render superfluous \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2014which\n    limits the federal habeas courts\u2019 discretion to take new evidence in an\n    evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, \u00a72254(e)(2) still restricts their\n    discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\n    court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence\n    in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is designed to strongly\n    discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13\u201314.\n          (c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,\n    because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster\n    merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone. P. 14.\n       2. On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled\n    to federal habeas relief. Pp. 14\u2018\u201331.\n          (a) To satisfy \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong, he\n    must show that \u201cthere was no reasonable basis\u201d for the State Su\n    preme Court\u2019s summary decision.

S. 668, provides the clearly\nestablished federal law here. To overcome the strong presumption\nthat counsel has acted competently, id., at 690, a defendant must\nshow that counsel failed to act \u201creasonabl[y] considering all the cir\ncumstances,\u201d id., at 688, and must prove the \u201creasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed\ning would have been different,\u201d id., at 694. Review here is thus \u201cdou\nbly deferential,\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___, requiring\na \u201chighly deferential\u201d look at counsel\u2019s performance, Strickland, su\npra, at 689, through \u00a72254(d)\u2019s \u201cdeferential lens,\u201d Mirzayance, supra,\nat ___, n. 2. Pp. 16\u201318.\n     (c) Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Court\u2019s de\ncision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his\ntrial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of fed\neral law. Pp. 18\u201326.\n        (1) The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel\nacted strategically to get the prosecution\u2019s aggravation witnesses ex\ncluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a\nmitigation witness. Billing records show that they spent time inves\ntigating mitigating evidence. The record also shows that they had an\nunsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history dur\ning the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.\nIn addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no sig\nnificant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster\u2019s medi\ncal and social history. Given these impediments, it would have been\na reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for\nPinholster\u2019s mother. Pinholster has responded with only a handful of\npost-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers. Pp. 18\u201323.\n        (2) The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from\nthis Court\u2019s recent cases a \u201cconstitutional duty to investigate\u201d and a\nprinciple that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an\ninvestigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster\u2019s back\nground. Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, \u201cspecific\nguidelines are not appropriate\u201d under Strickland. 466 U. S., at 688.\nNor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of\ncompetence mandated by Strickland. Pp. 23\u201326.\n     (d) Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster\nalso has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have un\nreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced. Pp. 26\u201331.\n        (1) To determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that\u201d\ndeath was not warranted, Strickland, supra, at 695, the aggravating\nevidence is reweighed \u201cagainst the totality of available mitigating\nevidence,\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534. Here, the State pre\n4                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    sented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty\n    phases. The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty\n    phase testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother and guilt-phase testimony\n    given by his brother. After considering the evidence, the jury re\n    turned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found sup\n    ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence. Pp. 26\u201329.\n           (2) There is no reasonable probability that the additional evi\n    dence presented at Pinholster\u2019s state proceedings would have\n    changed the verdict. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence largely duplicated the miti\n    gation evidence of his mother and brother at trial. To the extent that\n    there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of ques\n    tionable mitigating value. Dr. Woods\u2019 testimony would have opened\n    the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to\n    Pinholster\u2019s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems\n    could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation. The\n    remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. Given\n    what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in\n    state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court\u2019s\n    determination was unreasonable. Pp. 29\u201330.\n           (3) Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\n    question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and Rom\n    pilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, those cases lack the important \u201cdoubly\n    deferential\u201d standard of Strickland and AEDPA, and thus offer no\n    guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably de\n    termined that prejudice is lacking.

A jury convicted Pinholster of first-degree mur\u00ad\nder, and he was sentenced to death.\n   After the California Supreme Court twice unanimously\ndenied Pinholster habeas relief, a Federal District Court\nheld an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster ha\u00ad\nbeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District Court\nconcluded that Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel had been consti\u00ad\ntutionally ineffective at the penalty phase of trial. Sitting\nen banc, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed. Pinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651 (2009). Consid\u00ad\nering the new evidence adduced in the District Court\nhearing, the Court of Appeals held that the California\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   We granted certiorari and now reverse.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *JUSTICE GINSBURG and JUSTICE KAGAN join only Part II.\n2                  CULLEN v.

On the way, they\nstopped at Lisa Tapar\u2019s house, where Pinholster put his\nbuck knife through her front door and scratched a swas\u00ad\ntika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The\nthree men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no\none at Kumar\u2019s house, broke in, and began ransacking the\nhome. They came across only a small amount of mari\u00ad\njuana before Kumar\u2019s friends, Thomas Johnson and\nRobert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling\nthe police.\n  Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through\nthe rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pinholster\nbacked Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and\nmoney and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson\ndropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.\nBeckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster\nattacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.\nPinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men\u2019s\nwallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Mean\u00ad\nwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, \u201c \u2018bury[ing] his\nknife to the hilt.\u2019 \u201d 35 Reporter\u2019s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).\nJohnson and Beckett died of their wounds.\n  Corona drove the three men to Pinholster\u2019s apartment.\nWhile in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, \u201c \u2018We got\n\u2019em, man, we got \u2019em good.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. At the apartment,\nPinholster washed his knife, and the three split the pro\u00ad\nceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of mari\u00ad\njuana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to \u201clay\nlow,\u201d Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks\nlater. Id., at 4955.

S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState\u2019s primary witness. The prosecution brought numer\u00ad\nous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of\nfirst-degree murder.\n                             B\n  The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and\nWilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first\u00ad\ndegree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap\u00ad\npointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and\ninsisted on representing himself. During that time, the\nState had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him\nthat the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence\nduring the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of\ndeath.\n  The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.\nPinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an\nalibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into\nKumar\u2019s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982,\nand had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.\nPinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,\nwhile he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar\u2019s house to\nsteal more drugs and did not return for three hours.\nPinholster told the jury that he was a \u201cprofessional rob\u00ad\nber,\u201d not a murderer. 43 id., at 6204. He boasted of com\u00ad\nmitting hundreds of robberies over the previous six years\nbut insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The\njury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree\nmurder.\n  Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved\nto exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that\nthe prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence\nto be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar\nargued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was \u201cnot\npresently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.\u201d\n52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecu\u00ad\n4                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ntor \u201cpossibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.\u201d Ibid.\nThe trial court asked whether a continuance might be\nhelpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could\nnot think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster\u2019s\nmother and that additional time would not \u201cmake a great\ndeal of difference.\u201d Id., at 7257\u20137258. Three days later,\nafter hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster\nhad received notice while representing himself and denied\nthe motion to exclude.\n  The penalty phase was held before the same jury that\nhad convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight\nwitnesses, who testified about Pinholster\u2019s history of\nthreatening and violent behavior, including resisting\narrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with\njuvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary\nrecord. Defense counsel called only Pinholster\u2019s mother,\nBurnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster\u2019s\ntroubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin\u00ad\nholster\u2019s siblings, and described Pinholster as \u201ca perfect\ngentleman at home.\u201d Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not\ncall a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John\nStalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted\nPinholster\u2019s \u201cpsychopathic personality traits,\u201d diagnosed\nhim with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded\nthat he \u201cwas not under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance\u201d at the time of the murders. App.\n131.\n  After 2\u00bd days of deliberation, the jury unanimously\nvoted for death on each of the two murder counts. On\nmandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed\nthe judgment.

Represented by new counsel, Pinholster alleged,\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar\nhad failed to adequately investigate and present mitigat\u00ad\ning evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.\nPinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and\nlegal records, as well as declarations from family mem\u00ad\nbers, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who\ndiagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and\nseizure disorders. Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg\u2019s\nreport as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate.

In support of the new\nallegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating\nthat in 1984, Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel had provided him\nwith only some police reports and a 1978 probation report.\nDr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the\nmaterial that had since been gathered by Pinholster\u2019s\nhabeas counsel, he would have conducted \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d\nbefore concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a\npersonality disorder.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas held in abeyance to allow Pinholster to go back to\nstate court.\n   In August 1997, Pinholster filed his second state habeas\npetition, this time including Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration and\nrequesting judicial notice of the documents previously\nsubmitted in support of his first state habeas petition. His\nallegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of coun\u00ad\nsel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court again unanimously and sum\u00ad\nmarily denied the petition \u201con the substantive ground that\nit is without merit.\u201d2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 300.\n   Having presented Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration to the state\ncourt, Pinholster returned to the District Court. In No\u00ad\nvember 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffec\u00ad\ntive assistance of counsel were identical to those in his\nsecond state habeas petition. Both parties moved for\nsummary judgment and Pinholster also moved, in the\nalternative, for an evidentiary hearing.\n   The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.\n1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.\nBefore the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who\nstated that none of the new material he reviewed altered\nhis original diagnosis. Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr.\nWoods\u2019 conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar\ndisorder. Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at\nthe hearing. He presented two new medical experts: Dr.\nSophia Vinogradov, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinhol\u00ad\nster with organic personality syndrome and ruled out\nantisocial personality disorder, and Dr. Donald Olson, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 A majority also \u201c[s]eparately and independently\u201d denied several\n\nclaims, including penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel, as\nuntimely, successive, and barred by res judicata.

After Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S.\n202 (2003), clarified that AEDPA applies to cases like\nPinholster\u2019s, the court amended its order but did not alter\nits conclusion. Over a dissent, a panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.

The en banc court held that the District\nCourt\u2019s evidentiary hearing was not barred by 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(e)(2). The court then determined that new evidence\nfrom the hearing could be considered in assessing whether\nthe California Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\u00ad\nlished Federal law\u201d under \u00a72254(d)(1).

Taking the District Court evidence into\naccount, the en banc court determined that the California\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U.

The State argues that review is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.

Id., at 25.\n   We now hold that review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is limited to\nthe record that was before the state court that adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the\npast tense, to a state-court adjudication that \u201cresulted in\u201d\na decision that was contrary to, or \u201cinvolved\u201d an unrea\u00ad\nsonable application of, established law. This backward\u00ad\nlooking language requires an examination of the state\u00ad\ncourt decision at the time it was made. It follows that the\nrecord under review is limited to the record in existence at\nthat same time\u23afi.e., the record before the state court.\n   This understanding of the text is compelled by \u201cthe\nbroader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d which demon\u00ad\nstrates Congress\u2019 intent to channel prisoners\u2019 claims first\nto the state courts.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas\ncourt and reviewed by that court in the first instance\neffectively de novo.\n  Limiting \u00a72254(d)(1) review to the state-court record is\nconsistent with our precedents interpreting that statu\u00ad\ntory provision. Our cases emphasize that review under\n\u00a72254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did.\nState-court decisions are measured against this Court\u2019s\nprecedents as of \u201cthe time the state court renders its deci\u00ad\nsion.\u201d Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372 (2003). To\ndetermine whether a particular decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d\nthen-established law, a federal court must consider\nwhether the decision \u201capplies a rule that contradicts\n[such] law\u201d and how the decision \u201cconfronts [the] set of\nfacts\u201d that were before the state court. Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 405, 406 (2000) (Terry Williams). If the\nstate-court decision \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal\nprinciple\u201d in existence at the time, a federal court must\nassess whether the decision \u201cunreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Id., at 413. It\nwould be strange to ask federal courts to analyze whether\na state court\u2019s adjudication resulted in a decision that\nunreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the\nstate court.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that there is nothing strange about al\u00ad\n\nlowing consideration of new evidence under \u00a72254(d)(1) because, in her\nview, it would not be \u201cso different\u201d from some other tasks that courts\nundertake. Post, at 13 (dissenting opinion). What makes the consid\u00ad\neration of new evidence strange is not how \u201cdifferent\u201d the task would\nbe, but rather the notion that a state court can be deemed to have\nunreasonably applied federal law to evidence it did not even know\nexisted. We cannot comprehend how exactly a state court would have\nany control over its application of law to matters beyond its knowledge.\nAdopting JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s approach would not take seriously\nAEDPA\u2019s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions\nand would effectively treat the statute as no more than a \u201c \u2018mood\u2019 that\nthe Federal Judiciary must respect,\u201d Terry Williams, 529 U. S., at 386\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our recent decision in Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S.\n465 (2007), is consistent as well with our holding here. We\nexplained that \u201c[b]ecause the deferential standards pre\u00ad\nscribed by \u00a72254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a\nfederal court must take into account those standards in\ndeciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d\nId., at 474. In practical effect, we went on to note, this\nmeans that when the state-court record \u201cprecludes habeas\nrelief\u201d under the limitations of \u00a72254(d), a district court is\n\u201cnot required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 474\n(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recognition that\n\u201can evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can\nbe resolved by reference to the state court record\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420 (2000) (Michael Williams), as sup\u00ad\nporting the contrary view.        The question there was\nwhether the lower court had correctly determined that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) barred the petitioner\u2019s request for a federal\nevidentiary hearing.4 Michael Williams did not concern\nwhether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be\nconsidered under \u00a72254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at\nissue in that case was even subject to \u00a72254(d); the rest\nhad not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court\nproceedings. See id., at 429 (\u201cPetitioner did not develop,\nor raise, his claims . . . until he filed his federal habeas\npetition\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(opinion of Stevens, J.).\n  4 If a prisoner has \u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of a claim in\n\nState court proceedings,\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2) bars a federal court from holding\nan evidentiary hearing, unless the applicant meets certain statutory\nrequirements.\n  5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s suggestion that Michael Williams \u201crejected\u201d\n\nthe conclusion here, see post, at 15, is thus quite puzzling. In the\npassage that she quotes, see ibid., the Court merely explains that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) should be interpreted in a way that does not preclude a\nstate prisoner, who was diligent in state habeas court and who can\n12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   If anything, the decision in Michael Williams supports\nour holding. The lower court in that case had determined\nthat the one claim subject to \u00a72254(d)(1) did not satisfy\nthat statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this\nCourt concluded that it was \u201cunnecessary to reach the\nquestion whether \u00a72254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]\nhearing on th[at] claim.\u201d Id., at 444. That conclusion is\nfully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro\u00ad\nduced in federal court is irrelevant to \u00a72254(d)(1) review.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on Holland v. Jackson,\n542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam), was also mistaken. In\nHolland, we initially stated that \u201cwhether a state court\u2019s\ndecision was unreasonable [under \u00a72254(d)(1)] must be\nassessed in light of the record the court had before it.\u201d Id.,\nat 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu\u00ad\nment what some Courts of Appeals had held\u23afthat\n\u00a72254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does\nnot apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new\nevidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in\nstate court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide\nthat question because regardless, the hearing should have\nbeen barred by \u00a72254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump\u00ad\ntion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court\nhas no bearing on \u00a72254(d)(1) review. If a claim has\nbeen adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed\u00ad\neral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsatisfy \u00a72254(d), from receiving an evidentiary hearing.\n  6 In Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74 (2005) (per curiam), on which\n\nthe Court of Appeals also relied, we made the same assumption. Id., at\n79\u201380 (discussing the State\u2019s \u201cHolland argument\u201d).\n  7 Pinholster and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR place great weight on the fact\n\nthat \u00a72254(d)(2) includes the language \u201cin light of the evidence pre\u00ad\nsented in the State court proceeding,\u201d whereas \u00a72254(d)(1) does not.\nSee post, at 6\u20137. The additional clarity of \u00a72254(d)(2) on this point,\nhowever, does not detract from our view that \u00a72254(d)(1) also is plainly\nlimited to the state-court record.

Section 2254(e)(2)\nimposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas\ncourts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.\nSee Landrigan, supra, at 473 (noting that district courts,\nunder AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an\nevidentiary hearing). Like \u00a72254(d)(1), it carries out\n\u201cAEDPA\u2019s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federal\u00ad\nism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review\n[a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the\nfirst instance.\u201d Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).8\n   Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where\n\u00a72254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For exam\u00ad\nple, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall\nwithin the scope of \u00a72254(d), which applies only to claims\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\u201d At\na minimum, therefore, \u00a72254(e)(2) still restricts the discre\u00ad\ntion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence\nwhen deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the\nmerits in state court. See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529\nU.

The focus of that section is\nnot on \u201cpreserving the opportunity\u201d for hearings, post, at 9, but rather\non limiting the discretion of federal district courts in holding hearings.\nWe see no need in this case to address the proper application of\n\u00a72254(e)(2). See n. 20, infra. But see post, at 12 (suggesting that we\nhave given \u00a72254(e)(2) \u201can unnaturally cramped reading\u201d).\n  9 In all events, of course, the requirements of \u00a7\u00a72254(a) through (c)\n\nremain significant limitations on the power of a federal court to grant\nhabeas relief.\n14                   CULLEN v.

Pinholster disagrees and argues that the evidence\nadduced in the evidentiary hearing simply supports his alleged claim.\nBrief for Respondent 33\u201337.\n  We need not resolve this dispute because, even accepting Pinholster\u2019s\nposition, he is not entitled to federal habeas relief. Pinholster has\nfailed to show that the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied\nclearly established federal law on the record before that court, infra, at\n18\u201323, 26\u201330, which brings our analysis to an end. Even if the evi\u00ad\ndence adduced in the District Court additionally supports his claim, as\nPinholster contends, we are precluded from considering it.

Under California law, the California Supreme Court\u2019s sum\u00ad\nmary denial of a habeas petition on the merits reflects that court\u2019s\ndetermination that \u201cthe claims made in th[e] petition do not state a\nprima facie case entitling the petitioner to relief.\u201d In re Clark, 5\nCal. 4th 750, 770, 855 P. 2d 729, 741\u2013742 (1993). It appears that the\ncourt generally assumes the allegations in the petition to be true, but\ndoes not accept wholly conclusory allegations, People v. Duvall, 9\nCal. 4th 464, 474, 886 P. 2d 1252, 1258 (1995), and will also \u201creview the\nrecord of the trial . . . to assess the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims,\u201d\nClark, supra, at 770, 855 P. 2d, at 742.\n   The specific contents of the state-court record depend on which of the\ntwo state habeas proceedings is at issue. One amicus curiae suggests\nthat both are at issue\u23afthat is, Pinholster must prove that both Cali\u00ad\nfornia Supreme Court proceedings involved an unreasonable applica\u00ad\ntion of law under \u00a72254(d)(1). See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation 26. By contrast, the most favorable approach for Pinholster\nwould be review of only the second state habeas proceeding, the record\nof which includes all of the evidence that Pinholster ever submitted in\nstate habeas. We have not previously ruled on how to proceed in these\ncircumstances, and we need not do so here. Even taking the approach\nmost favorable to Pinholster, and reviewing only whether the California\nSupreme Court was objectively unreasonable in the second state\nhabeas proceeding, we find that Pinholster has failed to satisfy\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Thus, \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any\nclaim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct\nso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial\nprocess that the trial cannot be relied on as having pro\u00ad\nduced a just result.\u201d Id., at 686 (emphasis added).

Pinholster must demonstrate that it was necessarily\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to con\u00ad\nclude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presump\u00ad\ntion of competence; and (2) that he had failed to under\u00ad\nmine confidence in the jury\u2019s sentence of death.\n                              C\n                              1\n   Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient\nperformance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an\nunreasonable application of federal law. In arguing to the\nstate court that his counsel performed deficiently, Pinhol\u00ad\nster contended that they should have pursued and pre\u00ad\nsented additional evidence about: his family members and\ntheir criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his\nschooling; and his medical and mental health history,\nincluding his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation\nthat his trial counsel had \u201cno reasonable tactical basis\u201d for\nthe approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements\nhis counsel made at trial.

The Court of Appeals dissent\ndescribed one possible strategy:\n    \u201c[Pinholster\u2019s attorneys] were fully aware that they\n    would have to deal with mitigation sometime during\n    the course of the trial, did spend considerable time\n    and effort investigating avenues for mitigation[,] and\n    made a reasoned professional judgment that the best\n    way to serve their client would be to rely on the fact\n    that they never got [the required \u00a7190.3] notice and\n    hope the judge would bar the state from putting on\n    their aggravation witnesses.\u201d 590 F. 3d, at 701\u2013702\n    (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.).\nFurther, if their motion was denied, counsel were pre\u00ad\npared to present only Pinholster\u2019s mother in the penalty\nphase to create sympathy not for Pinholster, but for his\nmother. After all, the \u201c \u2018family sympathy\u2019 \u201d mitigation\ndefense was known to the defense bar in California at the\ntime and had been used by other attorneys. Id., at 707.\nRather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dett\u00ad\nmar\u2019s arguments were part of this trial strategy. See\nGentry, supra, at 8 (\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption that\n[counsel took certain actions] for tactical reasons rather\nthan through sheer neglect\u201d (citing Strickland, supra, at\n690)).\n  The state-court record supports the idea that Pinhol\u00ad\nster\u2019s counsel acted strategically to get the prosecution\u2019s\naggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if\nthat failed, to put on Pinholster\u2019s mother. Other state\u00ad\nments made during the argument regarding the motion to\nexclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take\nadvantage of a legal technicality and were not truly sur\u00ad\nprised.

Dettmar admitted that the prosecu\u00ad\ntor, \u201cbeing as thorough as she is, possibly ha[d] met the\nrequirement.\u201d Id., at 7250. But if so, he wanted her \u201cto\nmake that representation to the court.\u201d13 Ibid.\n   Timesheets indicate that Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel\ninvestigated mitigating evidence.14 Long before the guilty\nverdict, Dettmar talked with Pinholster\u2019s mother and\ncontacted a psychiatrist.15 On February 26, two months\nbefore the penalty phase started, he billed six hours\nfor \u201c[p]reparation argument, death penalty phase.\u201d See\nClerk\u2019s Tr. 864.

But during\ncross-examination, Pinholster admitted that he had previ\u00ad\nously been convicted of using a knife in a kidnaping.\nPinholster also said he was a white supremacist and that\nhe frequently carved swastikas into other people\u2019s prop\u00ad\nerty as \u201ca sideline to robbery.\u201d 44 id., at 6246.\n   Trial counsel\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Stalberg, had\nconcluded that Pinholster showed no significant signs or\nsymptoms of mental disorder or defect other than his\n\u201cpsychopathic personality traits.\u201d App. 131. Dr. Stalberg\nwas aware of Pinholster\u2019s hyperactivity as a youngster,\nhospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epilep\u00ad\ntic disorder, and history of drug dependency. Neverthe\u00ad\nless, Dr. Stalberg told counsel that Pinholster did not\nappear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly\nintoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did\nnot have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct.\n   Given these impediments, it would have been a reason\u00ad\nable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy\nfor Pinholster\u2019s mother. In fact, such a family sympathy\n22                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense is precisely how the State understood defense\ncounsel\u2019s strategy. The prosecutor carefully opened her\ncross-examination of Pinholster\u2019s mother with, \u201cI hope you\nunderstand I don\u2019t enjoy cross-examining a mother of\nanybody.\u201d 52 Tr. 7407. And in her closing argument, the\nprosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel\u2019s strat\u00ad\negy by pointing out, \u201cEven the most heinous person born,\neven Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved\nhim.\u201d 53 id., at 7452.\n   Pinholster\u2019s only response to this evidence is a series of\ndeclarations from Brainard submitted with Pinholster\u2019s\nfirst state habeas petition, seven years after the trial.\nBrainard declares that he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of inter\u00ad\nviewing any family members (other than Pinholster\u2019s\nmother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting\nto secure Pinholster\u2019s school or medical records, or of\ninterviewing any former teachers or counselors. Pet. for\nWrit of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616 (Cal.), Exh. 3.\nBrainard also declares that Dettmar was primarily re\u00ad\nsponsible for mental health issues in the case, but he has\n\u201cno recollection\u201d of Dettmar ever having secured Pinhol\u00ad\nster\u2019s medical records.

But it certainly can\nbe reasonable for attorneys to conclude that creating\nsympathy for the defendant\u2019s family is a better idea be\u00ad\ncause the defendant himself is simply unsympathetic.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s approach is flatly inconsistent\nwith Strickland\u2019s recognition that \u201c[t]here are countless\nways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\u201d\n466 U.

There comes a point where a defense\nattorney will reasonably decide that another strategy is in\norder, thus \u201cmak[ing] particular investigations unneces\u00ad\nsary.\u201d Id., at 691; cf. 590 F. 3d, at 692 (Kozinski, C.

S., at 25 (noting\nthat the state habeas court had correctly considered miti\u00ad\ngating evidence introduced during the guilt phase).\n  The State presented extensive aggravating evidence. As\nwe have already discussed, the jury watched Pinholster\nrevel in his extensive criminal history. Supra, at 21.\nThen, during the penalty phase, the State presented evi\u00ad\ndence that Pinholster had threatened to kill the State\u2019s\nlead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and\nkidnaped another person with a knife. The State showed\nthat Pinholster had a history of violent outbursts, includ\u00ad\ning striking and threatening a bailiff after a court proceed\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

The jury also heard about Pinholster\u2019s involve\u00ad\nment in juvenile gangs and his substantial disciplinary\nrecord in both county and state jails, where he had threat\u00ad\nened, assaulted, and thrown urine at guards, and fought\nwith other inmates. While in jail, Pinholster had been\nsegregated for a time due to his propensity for violence\nand placed on a \u201cspecial disciplinary diet\u201d reserved only\nfor the most disruptive inmates. 52 Tr. 7305.\n   The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the\npenalty-phase testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother, Brashear,\nwho gave a detailed account of Pinholster\u2019s troubled child\u00ad\nhood and adolescence. Early childhood was quite difficult.\nThe family \u201cdidn\u2019t have lots of money.\u201d Id., at 7404.\nWhen he was very young, Pinholster suffered two serious\nhead injuries, first at age 2 or 3 when he was run over by a\ncar, and again at age 4 or 5 when he went through the\nwindshield during a car accident. When he was 5, Pinhol\u00ad\nster\u2019s stepfather moved in and was abusive, or nearly so.\n   Pinholster always struggled in school. He was disrup\u00ad\ntive in kindergarten and was failing by first grade. He got\nin fights and would run out of the classroom. In third\ngrade, Pinholster\u2019s teacher suggested that he was more\nthan just a \u201c \u2018disruptive child.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 7394.

Brashear had thought then that \u201c[s]omething was\nnot working right.\u201d Id., at 7396.\n   By age 10 or 11, Pinholster was living in boy\u2019s homes\nand juvenile halls. He spent six months when he was 12\nin a state mental institution for emotionally handicapped\nchildren. By the time he was 18, Pinholster was in county\njail, where he was beaten badly. Brashear suspected that\nthe beating caused Pinholster\u2019s epilepsy, for which he has\nbeen prescribed medication. After a stint in state prison,\nPinholster returned home but acted \u201cunusual\u201d and had\ntrouble readjusting to life. Id., at 7405.\n   Pinholster\u2019s siblings were \u201cbasically very good children,\u201d\nalthough they would get into trouble. Id., at 7401. His\nbrother, Terry, had been arrested for drunk driving and\nhis sister, Tammy, for public intoxication. Tammy also\nwas arrested for drug possession and was self-destructive\nand \u201cwild.\u201d Ibid. Pinholster\u2019s eldest brother, Alvin, died a\nfugitive from California authorities.19\n   In addition to Brashear\u2019s penalty-phase testimony,\nPinholster had previously presented mitigating evidence\nduring the guilt phase from his brother, Terry. Terry\ntestified that Pinholster was \u201cmore or less in institutions\nall his life,\u201d suffered from epilepsy, and was \u201cmore or less\u201d\ndrunk on the night of the murders. 42 id., at 6015, 6036.\n   After considering this aggravating and mitigating evi\u00ad\ndence, the jury returned a sentence of death.

She similarly makes much of the fact\nthat the prosecutor \u201cbelittle[d]\u201d Brashear\u2019s testimony in closing argu\u00ad\nment. Post, at 33. We fail to see the point. Any diligent prosecutor\nwould have challenged whatever mitigating evidence the defense had\nput on. And, we would certainly not expect the prosecutor\u2019s closing\nargument to have described the evidence in the light most favorable to\nPinholster. But see ibid., n. 26.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial court found that the jury\u2019s determination was \u201csup\u00ad\nported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence\u201d and\nadded that \u201cthe factors in aggravation beyond all reason\u00ad\nable doubt outweigh those in mitigation.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Tr.\n1184, 1186.\n                               2\n   There is no reasonable probability that the additional\nevidence Pinholster presented in his state habeas proceed\u00ad\nings would have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. The \u201cnew\u201d\nevidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at\ntrial. School and medical records basically substantiate\nthe testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother and brother. Decla\u00ad\nrations from Pinholster\u2019s siblings support his mother\u2019s\ntestimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain\nthat Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even\nwooden boards.\n   To the extent the state habeas record includes new\nfactual allegations or evidence, much of it is of question\u00ad\nable mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods\nto testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinhol\u00ad\nster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state\nexpert. See, e.g., Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10\u201312) (taking into account\nthat certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the\npetitioner to further aggravating evidence). The new\nevidence relating to Pinholster\u2019s family\u23aftheir more seri\u00ad\nous substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal prob\u00ad\nlems, see post, at 22\u23afis also by no means clearly mitigat\u00ad\ning, as the jury might have concluded that Pinholster was\nsimply beyond rehabilitation. Cf. Atkins v. Virginia, 536\nU. S. 304, 321 (2002) (recognizing that mitigating evidence\ncan be a \u201ctwo-edged sword\u201d that juries might find to show\nfuture dangerousness).\n   The remaining new material in the state habeas record\nis sparse. We learn that Pinholster\u2019s brother Alvin died of\n30                  CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsuicide by drug overdose, and there are passing references\nto Pinholster\u2019s own drug dependency. According to Dr.\nStalberg, Pinholster\u2019s \u201cschool records\u201d apparently evi\u00ad\ndenced \u201csome degree\u201d of brain damage. App. to Brief in\nOpposition 219. Mostly, there are just a few new details\nabout Pinholster\u2019s childhood.       Pinholster apparently\nlooked like his biological father, whom his grandparents\n\u201cloathed.\u201d Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616\n(Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandpar\u00ad\nents \u201cspanked or disciplined\u201d the kids, Pinholster \u201calways\ngot the worst of it.\u201d Ibid. Pinholster was mostly unsuper\u00ad\nvised and \u201cdidn\u2019t get much love,\u201d because his mother and\nstepfather were always working and \u201cwere more concerned\nwith their own lives than the welfare of their kids.\u201d Id., at\n2. Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster\u2019s\nschooling. Finally, Pinholster\u2019s aunt once saw the children\nmixing flour and water to make something to eat, al\u00ad\nthough \u201c[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and\nfoods of that ilk.\u201d Id., at 1.\n   Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol\u00ad\nster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s determination was unreason\u00ad\nable. Having already heard much of what is included in\nthe state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of\ndeath. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely\nhave undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by\nPinholster\u2019s mother. The new material is thus not so\nsignificant that, even assuming Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel\nperformed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for\nthe California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster\nhad failed to show a \u201csubstantial\u201d likelihood of a different\nsentence.

But this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\nquestion of prejudice in those cases; each of them lack the\nimportant \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard of Strickland and\nAEDPA. See Terry Williams, 529 U.

Those cases therefore\noffer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has\nunreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking. We\nhave said time and again that \u201can unreasonable applica\u00ad\ntion of federal law is different from an incorrect applica\u00ad\ntion of federal law.\u201d Richter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) must\ntake into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.\nAs the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence\nreceived in the hearing in federal court gives \u00a72254(e)(2)\nan implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results\nthat Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of\nother provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law\non \u201ccause and prejudice.\u201d See post, at 9\u201312 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.).\n  Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court\nshould be rare. The petitioner generally must have made\na diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence\non which he seeks to rely. See \u00a72254(e)(2); Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420, 433\u2013434 (2000). If that requirement\nis not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual\npredicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if,\namong other things, \u201cthe facts underlying the claim would\nbe sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\n2                 CULLEN v.

Taylor, supra, a hearing\nshould not be held in federal court unless the new evi\ndence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and\ncould not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.\nSection 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but\nit does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other\nsituations. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473\u2013\n474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to\nreserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the\nstate courts acted unreasonably. See \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1), (2),\n(e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas\nrelief on the basis of evidence that could have been but\nwas not offered in state court would upset this scheme.\n   In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the\ndissent from the Court of Appeals\u2019 en banc decision, see\nPinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 688\u2013691 (CA9 2009)\n(opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal\ncourt hearing should not have been held because respon\ndent did not diligently present his new evidence to the\nCalifornia courts.

C. \u00a72254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA\u2019s hearing\nsection, \u00a72254(e), without work to do. An offender who\nbelieves he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a\nclaim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the\nstate courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court\nmay review that rejection on the basis of the materials\nconsidered by the state court. If the federal habeas court\nfinds that the state-court decision fails (d)\u2019s test (or if (d)\ndoes not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.\n   For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s facts (deciding that, even if those facts\nwere true, federal law was not violated), then (after find\ning the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing\nmight be needed to determine whether the facts alleged\nwere indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on\na state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade\n2                  CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nquate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the\npetitioner\u2019s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or\nif the state-court rejection rested on only one of several\nrelated federal grounds (e.g., that counsel\u2019s assistance was\nnot \u201cinadequate\u201d), then, if the federal court found that the\nstate court\u2019s decision in respect to the ground it decided\nviolated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider\nother related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,\nwhether the counsel\u2019s \u201cinadequate\u201d assistance was also\nprejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)\nhearing is needed as well.\n   In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)\nhearing is needed until we know whether the state court,\nin rejecting Pinholster\u2019s claim on the basis presented to\nthat state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower\ncourts\u2019 analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)\n   There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to\nintroduce evidence that was not first presented to the\nstate courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is\nwithout recourse to present new evidence. He can always\nreturn to state court presenting new evidence not previ\nously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he\nmight be able to return to federal court to make claims\nrelated to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA\u2019s limita\ntions on successive petitions. See \u00a72244.\n   I am not trying to predict the future course of these\nproceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is\nnot designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas\npetitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to con\nsider most matters and to insist that federal courts prop\nerly respect state-court determinations.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Congress recognized as much when it en\nacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the\nintroduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceed\nings in certain limited circumstances. See 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(e)(2). Under the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1), however, federal courts must turn a blind eye\nto new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s threshold obstacle to federal habeas\nrelief\u2014even when it is clear that the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief in light of that evidence. In reading\nthe statute to \u201ccompe[l]\u201d this harsh result, ante, at 9,\nthe Court ignores a key textual difference between\n\u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous\nunderstanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in\nfact, inform the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry. I therefore dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s first holding.\n   I also disagree with the Court that, even if the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record,\nrespondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision denying his ineffec\n2                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). There is no reason for the majority to decide\nwhether the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state\ncourt record because Pinholster satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on\neither the state- or federal-court record.\n                             I\n  The Court first holds that, in determining whether a\nstate-court decision is an unreasonable application of\nSupreme Court precedent under \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201creview . . . is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d Ante, at 9. New\nevidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is\nnow irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). This holding is unnecessary to pro\nmote AEDPA\u2019s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the\nprovision\u2019s text, the structure of the statute, and our\nprecedents.\n                              A\n   To understand the significance of the majority\u2019s holding,\nit is important to view the issue in context. AEDPA\u2019s\nentire structure\u2014which gives state courts the opportunity\nto decide factual and legal questions in the first instance\u2014\nensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas pro\nceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B.\nOstrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in\nU. S. District Courts 35\u201336 (2007) (evidentiary hearings\nunder AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and\n9.5 percent of capital cases). Even absent the new restric\ntion created by today\u2019s holding, AEDPA erects multiple\nhurdles to a state prisoner\u2019s ability to introduce new evi\ndence in a federal habeas proceeding.\n   First, \u201c[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas\npetitioner challenging a state conviction must first at\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

With certain narrow exceptions, federal\ncourts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new\nevidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted\nin state court.1 The exhaustion requirement thus reserves\nto state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual\ndisputes relevant to a state prisoner\u2019s claim.            See\nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999).\n  Second, the exhaustion requirement is \u201ccomplement[ed]\u201d\nby the standards set forth in \u00a72254(d). Harrington, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Under this provision, a fed\neral court may not grant habeas relief on any \u201cclaim that\nwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d\nunless the adjudication\n        \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n     involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n     lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States; or\n        \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n     reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n     evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nThese standards \u201ccontrol whether to grant habeas relief.\u201d\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474 (2007). Accord\ningly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner\nseeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy\nthese standards, there is no reason for a hearing. See id.,\nat 481. In such a case, the district court may exercise its\n\u201cdiscretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Ibid.; see also\ninfra, at 13\u201314. This approach makes eminent sense: If\ndistrict courts held evidentiary hearings without first\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Relatedly,a state prisoner must, as a general matter, properly ex\nhaust his federal claims in state court to avoid having his claim de\nfaulted on procedural grounds. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 750 (1991).\n4                     CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nasking whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to pre\nsent would satisfy AEDPA\u2019s demanding standards, they\nwould needlessly prolong federal habeas proceedings.\n  Third, even when a petitioner seeks to introduce new\nevidence that would entitle him to relief, AEDPA prohibits\nhim from doing so, except in a narrow range of cases,\nunless he \u201cmade a reasonable attempt, in light of the\ninformation available at the time, to investigate and pur\nsue claims in state court.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n420, 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). Thus, \u00a72254(e)(2)\nprovides:\n     \u201cIf the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis\n     of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall\n     not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless\n     the applicant shows that\u2014\n        \u201c(A) the claim relies on\u2014\n        \u201c(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroac\n     tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme\n     Court, that was previously unavailable; or\n        \u201c(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been\n     previously discovered through the exercise of due dili\n     gence; and\n        \u201c(B) the facts underlying the claim would be suffi\n     cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\n     that but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact\n     finder would have found the applicant guilty of the\n     underlying offense.\u201d\nIn Michael Williams, we construed the opening clause of\nthis provision\u2014which triggers the bar on evidentiary\nhearings\u2014to apply when \u201cthere is lack of diligence, or\nsome greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the\nprisoner\u2019s counsel.\u201d2 Id., at 432. AEDPA thus bars an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Section 2254(e)(2) also governs an attempt to obtain relief \u201cbased on\n\nnew evidence without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Holland v.

See ante, at 2 (ALITO,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \u201cWhen\nCongress codified new rules governing this previously\njudicially managed area of law, it did so without losing\nsight of the fact that the \u2018writ of habeas corpus plays a\nvital role in protecting constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d Holland v.\nFlorida, 560 U.

Allowing a\npetitioner to introduce new evidence at a hearing in the\nlimited circumstance permitted by \u00a72254(e)(2) does not\nupset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA be\ntween the state and federal courts.           By construing\n\u00a72254(d)(1) to do the work of other provisions in AEDPA,\nthe majority has subverted Congress\u2019 careful balance of\nresponsibilities.

The majority\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a72254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Con\ngress\u2019 decision to include language referring to the evi\ndence presented to the state court in \u00a72254(d)(2). Cf.\nBates v. United States, 522 U.

In particular, Con\ngress\u2019 decision to include in AEDPA a provision,\n\u00a72254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in\ncertain circumstances provides further evidence that\nCongress did not intend to limit the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry to\nthe state-court record in every case.\n  We have long recognized that some diligent habeas\npetitioners are unable to develop all of the facts support\ning their claims in state court.4 As discussed above, in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529 U.

Michael Williams,\n529 U. S., at 436; see also \u00a72254(e)(2). Importantly, it did\nnot impose any express limit on evidentiary hearings for\npetitioners who had been diligent in state court. See id.,\nat 436 (\u201c[T]he statute does not equate prisoners who exer\ncise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do\nnot\u201d). For those petitioners, Congress left the decision to\nhold a hearing \u201cto the sound discretion of district courts.\u201d\nLandrigan, 550 U. S., at 473.\n   Faced with situations in which a diligent petitioner\noffers additional evidence in federal court, the courts of\nappeals have taken two approaches to applying\n\u00a72254(d)(1). Some courts have held that when a federal\ncourt admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated\non the merits in state court, \u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall and the federal court may review the claim de novo.\nSee ante, at 12; Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649, 653\n(2004) (per curiam); see, e.g., Winston v. Kelly, 592 F. 3d\n535, 555\u2013556 (CA4 2010). I agree with the majority\u2019s\nrejection of this approach. See ante, at 12. It would un\ndermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to de\ncline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim\nbecause the state court, through no fault of its own,\nlacked all the relevant evidence.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Of\n       course, \u00a72254(d)(1) only applies when a state court has adjudi\ncated a claim on the merits. There may be situations in which new\nevidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits gives rise to an\naltogether different claim. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311\n(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give rise\nto a separate claim under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)). The\nmajority opinion does not foreclose this possibility.\n  I assume that the majority does not intend to suggest that review is\nlimited to the state-court record when a petitioner\u2019s inability to develop\nthe facts supporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself.

These courts have held\nthat \u00a72254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence\nproperly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the\nreasonableness of the state-court decision. See Pinholster\nv. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (\u201cIf the\nevidence is admissible under Michael Williams or\n\u00a72254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner\u2019s\nclaims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in\nevaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the\nstate habeas court was a reasonable application of Su\npreme Court law\u201d); accord, Wilson v.

This approach accommodates the competing goals,\nreflected in \u00a7\u00a72254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according defer\nence to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving\nthe opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence\nto the federal court when they were unable to do so in\nstate court.\n  The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I\nam aware, no court of appeals has adopted: \u00a72254(d)(1)\ncontinues to apply when a petitioner has additional evi\ndence that he was unable to present to the state court, but\nthe district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding\nwhether the petitioner has satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). The\nproblem with this approach is its potential to bar federal\nhabeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot\npresent new evidence to a state court.\n   Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently at\ntempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness\nstatements in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that\nthe withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level\nof materiality required under Brady. Before the time for\n10                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfiling a federal habeas petition has expired, however, a\nstate court orders the State to disclose additional docu\nments the petitioner had timely requested under the\nState\u2019s public records Act. The disclosed documents reveal\nthat the State withheld other exculpatory witness state\nments, but state law would not permit the petitioner to\npresent the new evidence in a successive petition.6\n   Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented\nhis Brady claim to the state court at all, his claim would\nbe deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to\nshow cause and prejudice to overcome the default. See\nMichael Williams, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1, supra.\nIf, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a Brady\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it\nis unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas\nrelief after today\u2019s holding. What may have been a rea\nsonable decision on the state-court record may no longer\nbe reasonable in light of the new evidence. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 436 (1995) (materiality of Brady\nevidence is viewed \u201ccollectively, not item by item\u201d). Be\ncause the state court adjudicated the petitioner\u2019s Brady\nclaim on the merits, \u00a72254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet,\nunder the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1), a fed\neral court is now prohibited from considering the new\nevidence in determining the reasonableness of the state\ncourt decision.\n   The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1) thus sug\ngests the anomalous result that petitioners with new\nclaims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain fed\neral habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for\ntheir default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence\nsupporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See, e.g., id., at 37\u201338 (statement by counsel for the respondent\n\nwarden that Virginia law bars all successive habeas applications, even\nin cases where the petitioner has new evidence).\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

That the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good\nreason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong. See\nKeeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1992) (\u201c[I]t is\n. . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly\nassert a federal claim in state court and failing in state\ncourt to properly develop such a claim\u201d).\n    The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting\nthat my hypothetical petitioner \u201cmay well [have] a new\nclaim.\u201d7 Ante, at 14, n. 10. This suggestion is puzzling.\nNew evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it\nmerely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudi\ncated on the merits.8 The majority presumably means\nto suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain\nfederal-court review of his new evidence if he can show\ncause and prejudice for his failure to present the \u201cnew\u201d\nclaim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the\nfederal court would review the purportedly \u201cnew\u201d claim de\nnovo. The majority\u2019s approach thus threatens to replace\ndeferential review of new evidence under \u00a72254(d)(1) with\nde novo review of new evidence in the form of \u201cnew\u201d\nclaims.9 Because it is unlikely that Congress intended\nde novo review\u2014the result suggested by the majority\u2019s\nopinion\u2014it must have intended for district courts to\nconsider newly discovered evidence in conducting the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The majority declines, however, to provide any guidance to the lower\n\ncourts on how to distinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new\nclaims.\n  8 Even if it can fairly be argued that my hypothetical petitioner has a\n\nnew claim, the majority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with\nnew evidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evi\ndence to a federal court.\n  9 In this vein, it is the majority\u2019s approach that \u201cwould not take seri\n\nously AEDPA\u2019s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court\ndecisions.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 3.\n12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority\u2019s reading of \u00a72254(d)(1) appears ultimately\nto rest on its understanding that state courts must have\nthe first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners\u2019\nclaims. See ante, at 9\u201310 (\u201cIt would be contrary to\n[AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to\novercome an adverse state-court decision with new evi\ndence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed\nby that court in the first instance effectively de novo\u201d).10\nJUSTICE BREYER takes the same position. See ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(AEDPA is designed \u201cto give the State a first opportunity\nto consider most matters\u201d). I fully agree that habeas\npetitioners must attempt to present evidence to state\ncourts in the first instance, as does JUSTICE ALITO, see\nante, at 2. Where I disagree with the majority is in my\nunderstanding that \u00a72254(e)(2) already accomplishes this\nresult.    By reading \u00a72254(d)(1) to do the work of\n\u00a72254(e)(2), the majority gives \u00a72254(e)(2) an unnaturally\ncramped reading. As a result, the majority either has\nforeclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who,\nthrough no fault of their own, were unable to present\nexculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated\ntheir claims or has created a new set of procedural com\nplexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the\navailability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.\n                             3\n  These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of\nappeals that have concluded that a federal court should\nassess the reasonableness of a state court\u2019s application of\nclearly established federal law under \u00a72254(d)(1) in light\nof evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary\nhearing. There is nothing \u201cstrange\u201d about this approach.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Under my reading of \u00a72254(d)(1), of course, the district court would\n\nreview properly admitted new evidence through the deferential lens of\n\u00a72254(d)(1), not de novo.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Under \u00a72254(d)(1), federal courts routinely\nengage in analysis that the state court itself might never\nhave conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a\nstate court summarily denies a claim without explanation,\nas the California Supreme Court did here, district courts\nmust deny habeas relief pursuant to \u00a72254(d)(1) so long as\n\u201cthere is any reasonable argument\u201d supporting the denial\nof the petitioner\u2019s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court\ndecision unreasonably applied clearly established federal\nlaw when the state court issued a reasoned decision but\nfailed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,\n537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a\nstate court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief\nin light of newly discovered evidence is not so different\nthan determining whether there is any reasonable basis\nfor a state court\u2019s unreasoned decision.\n   Admittedly, the text of \u00a72254(d)(1), standing alone, does\nnot compel either reading of that provision. But constru\ning \u00a72254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop\nerly introduced in federal court best accords with the text\nof \u00a72254(d)(2) and AEDPA\u2019s structure as a whole. By\ninterpreting \u00a72254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners\nfrom gaming the system\u2014the very purpose of\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2014the majority potentially has put habeas relief\nout of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious\nclaims based on new evidence.\n                            C\n  The majority claims that its holding is \u201cconsistent\u201d with\nour case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our\ncases reflect our previous understanding that evidence\nproperly admitted pursuant to \u00a72254(e)(2) is relevant to\nthe \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.\n  In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today\u2019s\nopinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay\n14                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbetween \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we\nadmonished district courts to consider whether a peti\ntioner\u2019s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy \u00a72254(d)\nin determining whether to grant a hearing. After high\nlighting the deference owed to state courts under\n\u00a7\u00a72254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:\n     \u201cIn deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,\n     a federal court must consider whether such a hearing\n     could enable an applicant to prove the petition\u2019s fac\n     tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\n     applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer\n     ential standards prescribed by \u00a72254 control whether\n     to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into\n     account those standards in deciding whether an evi\n     dentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d 550 U. S., at 474 (ci\n     tation omitted).\nBy instructing district courts to consider the \u00a72254(d)\nstandards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must\nhave understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing\ncould be considered in the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9\n(\u201cThe whole point of Landrigan\u2019s admonition that the\ncourt must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye\non \u00a72254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not\njustify federal fact-finding in view of \u00a72254(d)(1), but that\nother proffers of proof will\u201d).11\n   In Michael Williams, the warden argued that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti\ntioner was unable to develop the factual record in state\ncourt, \u201cwhether or not through his own fault or neglect.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan. It quotes Landri\n\ngan\u2019s observation that \u201cif the record refutes the applicant\u2019s factual\nallegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not\nrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing,\u201d 550 U. S., at 474, but that\nstatement has no bearing on the question decided by the Court today.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

Under the warden\u2019s argument, a peti\ntioner who did not develop the record in state court, what\never the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence\nto the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we\nobserved:\n     \u201cA prisoner who developed his claim in state court and\n     can prove the state court\u2019s decision was \u2018contrary to,\n     or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es\n     tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States,\u2019 is not barred from obtain\n     ing relief by \u00a72254(d)(1). If the opening clause of\n     \u00a72254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear\n     ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but\n     remained undeveloped in state court because, for in\n     stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner\n     lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence\n     could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he\n     could satisfy \u00a72254(d).\u201d Id., at 434 (citation omitted;\n     emphasis added).\nA petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly\nbe unable to \u201csatisfy \u00a72254(d)\u201d without introducing the\nconcealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects\nour understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti\ntioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court\nto prove the facts necessary to satisfy \u00a72254(d). To avoid\nforeclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded\nthat \u00a72254(e)(2) could not bear the warden\u2019s \u201charsh read\ning,\u201d which essentially would have held petitioners strictly\nat fault for their inability to develop the facts in state\ncourt. Ibid. The majority today gives an equally \u201charsh\nreading\u201d to \u00a72254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in\nMichael Williams.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The majority claims that Michael Williams supports its reading of\n\n\u00a72254(d)(1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we\nobserved that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits\n16                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   None of the other cases cited by the majority supports\nits result. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)\n(Terry Williams), we interpreted \u00a72254(d)(1) to ask\nwhether the state-court decision \u201cidentifies the correct\ngoverning legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\nprisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Id., at 413. However, we had no reason\nto decide whether the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to\nthe state-court record, as the District Court did not hold\nan evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.\n   In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that \u201cwe have made\nclear that whether a state court\u2019s decision was unreason\nable must be assessed in light of the record the court had\nbefore it.\u201d 542 U. S., at 652. In the next sentence, how\never, we observed that the evidence at issue \u201ccould have\nbeen the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District\nCourt, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to\ndevelop that evidence in state court.\u201d Id., at 652\u2013653. We\nproceeded to find that the evidence was not properly ad\nmitted under \u00a72254(e)(2) before concluding that the Court\nof Appeals had erred in its \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis. Id., at\n653; see also Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74, 79 (2005)\n(per curiam).\n   In sum, our cases reflect our recognition that it is some\ntimes appropriate to consider new evidence in deciding\nwhether a petitioner can satisfy \u00a72254(d)(1). In reading\nour precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the ma\njority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision\nin Michael Williams: Some petitioners, even if diligent,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunder \u00a72254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether\n\u00a72254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.\u201d 529 U. S., at 444.\nThat statement merely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had\nrejected that claim under \u00a72254(d)(1) without considering whether the\npetitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not\nrequested a hearing on that claim. See Williams v. Taylor, 189 F. 3d\n421, 425, 428\u2013429 (CA4 1999).\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation as Amicus Curiae 26. This argument is based on amicus\u2019\nunderstanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second\npetition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has\nnot argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural\nground. See ante, at 6, n. 2. When a state court denies two petitions on\nthe merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second\npetition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim,\nI see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the\nfirst decision was unreasonable.\n18                 CULLEN v.

He also observed\nthat Pinholster\u2019s \u201cgrossly dysfunctional family, the abuse\nhe received as a child, his history of suffering from sub\nstantial seizure and mood disorders, his frequently un\ntreated psychiatric and psychological disabilities and his\neducational handicaps were relevant circumstances which\nwould extenuate the gravity of the crime.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013171.\n   On the basis of Pinholster\u2019s submission, the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective-assistance\nof-counsel claim.\n   Pinholster then filed a habeas petition in Federal Dis\ntrict Court.

The only documents they provided to him\nwere police reports relating to the case and a 1978 probation report. In\na two-page report that focused primarily on Pinholster\u2019s mental state at\nthe time of the offenses, Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had\n\u201cpsychopathic personality traits.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013187.\n24                    CULLEN v.

Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 20) (quoting Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n526\u2013527 (2003)). The majority\u2019s explanation for counsel\u2019s\nconduct contradicts the best available evidence of counsel\u2019s\nactions: Dettmar\u2019s frank, contemporaneous statement to\nthe trial judge that he \u201chad not prepared any evidence by\nway of mitigation.\u201d 52 Tr. 7250. The majority\u2019s conjecture\nthat counsel had in fact prepared a mitigation defense,\nbased primarily on isolated entries in counsel\u2019s billing\nrecords, requires it to assume that Dettmar was lying to\nthe trial judge.20\n   In any event, even if Pinholster\u2019s counsel had a strategic\nreason for their actions, that would not automatically\nrender their actions reasonable. For example, had counsel\ndecided their best option was to move to exclude the ag\ngravating evidence, it would have been unreasonable to\nforgo a mitigation investigation on the hope that the mo\ntion would be granted. With a client\u2019s life at stake, it\nwould \u201cflou[t] prudence,\u201d Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.

The cited\nentries predating that event show only that counsel conducted about\none day\u2019s worth of investigation\u2014consisting of talking to Brashear and\nresearching epilepsy\u2014two months before the penalty phase.

There is no evidence in the records that counsel\nactually planned to present mitigating evidence.

As we stated in Strickland:\n    \u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made af\n    ter less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n    investigations or to make a reasonable decision that\n    makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\n    ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to inves\n    tigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in\n    all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n    deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d 466 U.

S., at 528.23\n   This case is remarkably similar to Wiggins. As the\nmajority reads the record, counsel\u2019s mitigation investiga\ntion consisted of talking to Pinholster\u2019s mother, consulting\nwith Dr. Stalberg, and researching epilepsy.24 Ante, at 20.\nWhat little information counsel gleaned from this \u201crudi\nmentary\u201d investigation, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 524, would\nhave led any reasonable attorney \u201cto investigate further,\u201d\nid., at 527. Counsel learned from Pinholster\u2019s mother that\nhe attended a class for educationally handicapped chil\ndren, that a psychologist had recommended placing him in\na mental institution, and that he spent time in a state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 As the majority notes, see ante, at 24\u201325, Wiggins\u2019 trial counsel\n\nacknowledged that the investigation he conducted was inconsistent\nwith standard practice in Maryland. See 539 U. S., at 524. We inde\npendently concluded, however, that the investigation \u201cwas also unrea\nsonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in the . . . records.\u201d\nId., at 525 (emphasis added).\n  24 The majority also posits that Brainard likely spent time preparing\n\nPinholster\u2019s brother Terry. However, Terry averred in a declaration\nthat Pinholster\u2019s attorneys \u201cnever asked [him] any questions relating to\nScott\u2019s background or [their] family history.\u201d Record ER\u2013313.\n30                CULLEN v.

Yet counsel\nmade no effort to obtain the readily available evidence\nsuggested by the information they learned, such as Pin\nholster\u2019s schooling or medical records, or to contact\nPinholster\u2019s school authorities. They did not contact Dr.\nDubin or the many other health-care providers who had\ntreated Pinholster.

S., at 526. Dettmar told the trial judge\nthat he was unprepared to present any mitigation evi\ndence. The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on\ncan be described, at best, as \u201chalfhearted.\u201d Ibid. Counsel\nmade no effort to bolster Brashear\u2019s self-interested testi\nmony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor\neffectively emphasized in closing argument. And because\nthey did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize\nthat Brashear\u2019s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad\napple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.\n   In denying Pinholster\u2019s claim, the California Supreme\nCourt necessarily overlooked Strickland\u2019s clearly estab\nlished admonition that \u201cstrategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to\nthe extent that reasonable professional judgments support\nthe limitations.\u201d 466 U. S., at 690\u2013691. As in Wiggins, in\nlight of the information available to Pinholster\u2019s counsel, it\nis plain that \u201creasonable professional judgments\u201d could not\nhave supported their woefully inadequate investigation.25\n466 U. S., at 691. Accordingly, the California Supreme\nCourt could not reasonably have concluded that Pinholster\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 The majority chastises the Court of Appeals for \u201cattributing strict\nrules to this Court\u2019s recent case law.\u201d Ante, at 24. I agree that courts\nshould not interpret our cases to prescribe strict rules regarding the\nrequired scope of mitigation investigations. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545\nU. S. 374, 394 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (noting \u201cour longstand\ning case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney\u2019s per\nformance was unconstitutionally deficient under Strickland\u201d). The\nNinth Circuit, however, did no such thing. It appropriately gave\nthoughtful consideration to the guideposts contained in these cases,\njust as we have previously done. See, e.g., Bobby v. Van Hook, 558\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8).\n32                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhad failed to allege that his counsel\u2019s investigation was\ninadequate under Strickland.\n                             D\n   The majority also concludes that the California Supreme\nCourt could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did\nnot state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of\nthe overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before\nthe jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant\nmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro\nceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. When a\nhabeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, \u201cthe ques\ntion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\nabsent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded\nthat the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum\nstances did not warrant death.\u201d Id., at 695. This inquiry\nrequires evaluating \u201cthe totality of the available mitiga\ntion evidence\u2014both that adduced at trial, and the evi\ndence adduced in the habeas proceeding\u2014in reweighing it\nagainst the evidence in aggravation.\u201d Terry Williams, 529\nU. S., at 397\u2013398. The ultimate question in this case is\nwhether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra\nvating evidence, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict\nto impose a death sentence).\n                              1\n  Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its\nverdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded\nthat Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the\nmajority states, the jury saw Pinholster \u201crevel\u201d in his\nhistory of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

He threatened to kill the State\u2019s lead\nwitness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in\njail.\n  Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently\nintended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19\u201320; see also\nante, at 27\u201328.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,\nBrashear was not a neutral witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (\u201cA\nmother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.\nClearly not the most unbiased witness in the world\u201d).\nNotwithstanding Brashear\u2019s obvious self-interest, counsel\nfailed to offer readily available, objective evidence that\nwould have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.\nTheir failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her\ntestimony in closing argument. See supra, at 19\u201320. And\nBrashear\u2019s statement that Pinholster would not be alive\nmuch longer because he had \u201ca chip in his head floating\naround,\u201d 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her\ncredibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447\n(\u201cDoes she want you to believe sometime before he got to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear\u2019s testi\n\nmony. Although Brashear testified that the family \u201cdidn\u2019t have lots of\nmoney,\u201d she followed up that comment by stating that Pinholster did\nnot bring friends to the house because \u201cit was too nice a house.\u201d 52 Tr.\n7404. The prosecutor did not understand Brashear to have testified\nthat Pinholster\u2019s childhood was deprived. See 53 id., at 7442 (\u201cYou\nheard that he was not a deprived child\u201d). Nor did the California Su\npreme Court on direct appeal. People v. Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 910,\n824 P. 2d 571, 587 (1992).\n  Brashear did testify that Pinholster\u2019s stepfather tried to \u201cdiscipline\u201d\nhim and that he was \u201cat times\u201d \u201cabusive or near abusive.\u201d 52 Tr. 7392\u2013\n7393. She suggested, however, that Pinholster deserved the \u201cdisci\npline\u201d he received. See, e.g., id., at 7392 (\u201cScott was always\u2014he had a\nmind of his own\u201d). It is unlikely the jury understood Brashear to be\nsuggesting that her husband routinely beat Pinholster. The prosecutor\ndid not come away with this understanding. See 53 id., at 7442.\n34                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncountry jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball and\nsaid, \u2018In three years you are going to die\u2019? That\u2019s ridicu\nlous\u201d). The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with\nBrashear\u2019s testimony. See supra, at 20.\n   Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster\u2019s state\ncourt petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her\ntestimony in ways that undermined Pinholster\u2019s mitiga\ntion case. As in Sears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the\nprosecutor used Brashear\u2019s testimony that Pinholster\ncame from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.\n   In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating\nevidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their half\nhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate\nfor the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days\nto reach a decision to impose a death sentence.\n                             2\n  The additional mitigating evidence presented to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201cadds up to a mitigation case\nthat bears no relation\u201d to Brashear\u2019s unsubstantiated\ntestimony. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 393.\n  Assuming the evidence presented to the California\nSupreme Court to be true, as that court was required to\ndo, the new mitigating evidence presented to that court\nwould have shown that Pinholster was raised in \u201cchaos\nand poverty.\u201d Record ER\u2013312. The family home was filled\nwith violence. Pinholster\u2019s siblings had extremely trou\nbled pasts.

The available records con\nfirmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure\ndisorders, which may have been caused by his childhood\nhead injuries.\n   On this record, I do not see how it can be said that \u201c[t]he\n\u2018new\u2019 evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence\nat trial.\u201d Ante, at 29; see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S.\n279, 298\u2013299 (1991) (evidence is not \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d\nif it corroborates other evidence that is \u201cunbelievable\u201d on\nits own). Brashear\u2019s self-interested testimony was not\nconfirmed with objective evidence, as the prosecutor high\nlighted. The new evidence would have \u201cdestroyed the\n[relatively] benign conception of [Pinholster\u2019s] upbringing\u201d\npresented by his mother. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391. The\njury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suf\nfered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and\ncounsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand\nthe likely effect of Pinholster\u2019s head injuries or his bizarre\nbehavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no\ntestimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinhol\nster\u2019s likely neurological problems. And it heard no medi\ncal evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.\n   The majority responds that \u201cmuch\u201d of Pinholster\u2019s new\nmitigating evidence \u201cis of questionable mitigating value.\u201d\nAnte, at 29. By presenting psychiatric testimony, it con\ntends, \u201cPinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal\nby a state expert.\u201d Ibid. But, because the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster\u2019s petition on the plead\nings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might\nhave said. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is rea\nsonably probable that at least one juror would have cred\nited his expert. In any event, even if a rebuttal expert\ntestified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personal\nity disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to\nthe jury. See ante, at 22 (describing Pinholster as a \u201cpsy\nchotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared\n36                     CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhim to the jury\u201d). It is for this reason that it was espe\ncially important for counsel to present the available evi\ndence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See Sears,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the\njudge and jury would have heard credible evidence show\ning that Pinholster\u2019s criminal acts and aggressive tenden\ncies were \u201cattributable to a disadvantaged background, or\nto emotional and mental problems.\u201d Penry, 492 U. S., at\n319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would have\nlearned that Pinholster had the \u201c \u2018kind of troubled history\nwe have declared relevant to assessing a defendant\u2019s\nmoral culpability.\u2019 \u201d Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). Applying Strickland,\nwe have repeatedly found \u201ca reasonable probability,\u201d 466\nU. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have reached a\ndifferent result had counsel presented similar evidence.\nSee, e.g., Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\u201313) (evi\ndence of the defendant\u2019s childhood history of physical\nabuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic\nmilitary service); Rompilla, 545 U.

S., at 398 (evidence of childhood\nmistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic\nmental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).\n   The majority does not dispute the similarity between\nthis case and the cited cases. However, it criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for relying on Rompilla and Terry Wil\nliams on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice ques\ntion de novo in those cases. See ante, at 31. I do not read\nTerry Williams to review the prejudice question de novo.27\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 27 Terry   Williams held that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cunreason\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

In each of these cases, we did not purport to\ncreate new law; we simply applied the same clearly estab\nlished precedent, Strickland, to a different set of facts.\nBecause these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation\nevidence that suffice to establish prejudice under Strick\nland, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for\ncourts to consider when determining whether a state court\nhas unreasonably applied Strickland.\n   In many cases, a state court presented with additional\nmitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is\nno \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This is not such\na case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and\nkilled two people, and his history of violent outbursts and\nburglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the\nhomicides did not appear premeditated. And the State\u2019s\naggravation case was no stronger than in Rompilla and\nTerry Williams. See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant\ncommitted murder by torture and had a significant history\nof violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418\n(Rehnquist, C.

Even on the trial record, it took the jury two\ndays to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the \u201cnot\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nable in at least two respects\u201d: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard,\n\nsee 529 U.

Given these considerations, it\nis not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that\na juror familiar with his troubled background and psychi\natric issues would have reached the same conclusion\nregarding Pinholster\u2019s culpability. Fairminded jurists\ncould not doubt that, on the record before the California\nSupreme Court, \u201cthere [was] a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d\nWiggins, 539 U.

The additional\nevidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only\nconfirms that conclusion.\n                              A\n   At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same\ndocuments that were before the state habeas court. He\nalso offered his trial attorneys\u2019 billing records, which were\nbefore the state habeas court as part of the trial record. Of\nthe seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six\nhad previously executed declarations in support of Pinhol\nster\u2019s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster\u2019s\nuncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)\n   Two experts testified on Pinholster\u2019s behalf; neither had\npresented declarations to the state habeas court. The first\nwas Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology\nand neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric\nEpilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.\nIt appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the\ntestimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the fed\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Relying in part on Pinholster\u2019s abnormal\nEEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster\u2019s childhood acci\ndents \u201clikely result[ed] in brain injury\u201d and that these\ninjuries \u201cconferred a risk of epilepsy.\u201d Record ER\u2013699 to\nER\u2013700.

She highlighted\nPinholster\u2019s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy,\nabusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance\nabuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.\nShe opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from\nchildhood head traumas:\n    \u201cAll data indicates that there were severe effects of\n    the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and\n    age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to\n    dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and\n    learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggres\n    sivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, sei\n    zure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013\n    731.\nShe also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinhol\nster was in an \u201capparently hallucinatory state [that] was\nlikely the result of his intoxication with multiple sub\nstances.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013707\n   The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the\n40                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npsychiatrist who had examined Pinholster in the middle of\ntrial,28 and Dr. David Rudnick. Although Dr. Stalberg\nmaintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial per\nsonality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the\nmiddle of trial, he again emphasized that there was \u201cvo\nluminous\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d mitigation evidence that had\nnot previously been made available to him or presented to\nthe jury. Id., at ER\u2013926, ER\u2013953. He stated that conver\nsations with Pinholster\u2019s family revealed that he and his\nsiblings were \u201craised like animals, wild animals,\u201d id., at\nER\u2013948, and he opined that Pinholster\u2019s upbringing was a\nrisk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See ibid.\n(Pinholster\u2019s upbringing \u201cwould speak volumes, looking at\nit from a mitigation point of view\u201d). And he agreed that\nthe mitigation evidence presented at trial was \u201cprofoundly\nmisleading.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013966. Dr. Rudnick testified that\nPinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.\n   The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 proba\ntion report that Pinholster\u2019s counsel had in their posses\nsion at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that\ncounsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for\neducationally handicapped children, that he was commit\nted to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped chil\ndren, and that he suffered two \u201csevere head injuries.\u201d Id.,\nat SER\u2013243.\n                             B\n     Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   28 Before the hearing, Dr. Stalberg had opined that Pinholster was\n\n\u201csubstantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergis\ntically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the crime\nwas committed.\u201d Record ER\u2013587. At a prehearing deposition, however,\nDr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe\nthat Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the\ndeposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, pre\nsumably in light of Dr. Stalberg\u2019s unexpected change in position. The\nState then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    41\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwas duplicative of the evidence submitted to the California\nSupreme Court. The additional evidence presented at the\nhearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court\ncould not reasonably have rejected Pinholster\u2019s claim.29\n   For example, the probation report presented by the\nState confirmed that counsel had in their possession in\nformation that would have led any reasonable attorney \u201cto\ninvestigate further.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Counsel\nnevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.\n   Pinholster\u2019s experts opined that his childhood head\ntraumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a\nrisk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony\nthat Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was\nnot clear error for the District Court to conclude that\njurors could have credited Pinholster\u2019s experts. Even the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 The  State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on\nthe evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not dili\ngent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was there\nfore barred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat\nimprecise. Pinholster\u2019s allegations in his amended federal petition\nwere \u201cidentical\u201d to the allegations he presented to the California\nSupreme Court, ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in\nstate court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster\u2019s\nnew expert testimony changed \u201cthe factual basis\u201d of his claim such that,\nby the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied\n\u00a72254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that\nPinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, \u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural\ndefault. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim\nto the District Court.\n  In any event, Pinholster satisfied \u00a72254(e)(2) in this case. He made\n\u201ca reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time,\nto investigate and pursue claims in state court.\u201d Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I\ncannot read \u00a72254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners\nmust use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule\nwould result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of\nthe unanticipated death of an expert.\n42                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nState\u2019s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the \u201cvolumi\nnous\u201d mitigation evidence in Pinholster\u2019s case. Record ER\u2013\n926.\n  In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap\nparent from the state-court record: Pinholster\u2019s counsel\nfailed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,\nand there was a reasonable probability that at least one\njuror confronted with the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigating evi\ndence counsel should have discovered would have voted to\nspare Pinholster\u2019s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the\nbasis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below\ncorrectly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision reflected an unrea\nsonable application of Strickland.30\n                        *     *     *\n  I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court\u2019s ruling. I\nfear the consequences of the Court\u2019s novel interpretation\nof \u00a72254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with\ncompelling evidence supporting their claims who were\nunable, through no fault of their own, to present that\nevidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.\nAnd the Court\u2019s conclusion that the California Supreme\nCourt reasonably denied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel\u2019s failure to\ninvestigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast\nbetween the woefully inadequate mitigation case they\npresented and the evidence they should and would have\ndiscovered. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 The State\u2019s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions\n\nwhether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi\ntional evidence in the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not\nchallenged the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had\nproved that he was \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws\nor treaties of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(a).\n",

PINHOLSTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131088. Argued November 9, 2010\u2014Decided April 4, 2011\nA California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first\n  degree murder. At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prose\n  cution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster\u2019s his\n  tory of threatening and violent behavior. Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel,\n  who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the\n  ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice\n  under California law, called only Pinholster\u2019s mother. Counsel did\n  not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg,\n  who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.\n  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sen\n  tenced to death. Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the Califor\n  nia Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had\n  failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence dur\n  ing the penalty phase. He introduced additional evidence to support\n  his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from\n  family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychia\n  trist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure dis\n  orders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg\u2019s report. Each time, the State\n  Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the\n  merits. Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary\n  hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28\n  U. S. C. \u00a72254. Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the\n  new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the\n  State Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable applica\n  tion of . . . clearly established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before\n the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pp. 8\u201314.\n2                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\n    alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a72254 sets several limits on a federal\n    court\u2019s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant\n    here, a claim that has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court\n    proceedings,\u201d \u201cshall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication\u201d \u201c(1)\n    resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason\n    able application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d or \u201c(2) resulted\n    in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n    facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\n    \u00a72254(d). This \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n    ___, ___, and \u201c \u2018highly deferential standard\u2019 . . . demands that state\n    court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Woodford v. Vis\n    ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24. Section 2254(d)(1)\u2019s backward-looking lan\n    guage\u2014\u201cresulted in\u201d and \u201cinvolved\u201d\u2014requires an examination of the\n    state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re\n    cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that\n    same time\u2014i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com\n    pelled by \u201cthe broader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d which dem\n    onstrates Congress\u2019 intent to channel prisoners\u2019 claims first to state\n    courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. It is also con\n    sistent with this Court\u2019s precedents, which emphasize that\n    \u00a72254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,\n    e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372. Moreover, it is consis\n    tent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained\n    that a federal habeas court is \u201cnot required to hold an evidentiary\n    hearing\u201d when the state-court record \u201cprecludes habeas relief\u201d under\n    \u00a72254(d)\u2019s limitations. The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil\n    liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649,\n    as supporting the contrary view. Pp. 8\u201312.\n          (b) This holding does not render superfluous \u00a72254(e)(2)\u2014which\n    limits the federal habeas courts\u2019 discretion to take new evidence in an\n    evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, \u00a72254(e)(2) still restricts their\n    discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\n    court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence\n    in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is designed to strongly\n    discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13\u201314.\n          (c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,\n    because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster\n    merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone. P. 14.\n       2. On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled\n    to federal habeas relief.

S. 668, provides the clearly\nestablished federal law here. To overcome the strong presumption\nthat counsel has acted competently, id., at 690, a defendant must\nshow that counsel failed to act \u201creasonabl[y] considering all the cir\ncumstances,\u201d id., at 688, and must prove the \u201creasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed\ning would have been different,\u201d id., at 694. Review here is thus \u201cdou\nbly deferential,\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___, requiring\na \u201chighly deferential\u201d look at counsel\u2019s performance, Strickland, su\npra, at 689, through \u00a72254(d)\u2019s \u201cdeferential lens,\u201d Mirzayance, supra,\nat ___, n. 2. Pp. 16\u201318.\n     (c) Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Court\u2019s de\ncision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his\ntrial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of fed\neral law. Pp. 18\u201326.\n        (1) The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel\nacted strategically to get the prosecution\u2019s aggravation witnesses ex\ncluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a\nmitigation witness. Billing records show that they spent time inves\ntigating mitigating evidence. The record also shows that they had an\nunsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history dur\ning the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.\nIn addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no sig\nnificant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster\u2019s medi\ncal and social history. Given these impediments, it would have been\na reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for\nPinholster\u2019s mother. Pinholster has responded with only a handful of\npost-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers. Pp. 18\u201323.\n        (2) The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from\nthis Court\u2019s recent cases a \u201cconstitutional duty to investigate\u201d and a\nprinciple that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an\ninvestigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster\u2019s back\nground. Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, \u201cspecific\nguidelines are not appropriate\u201d under Strickland. 466 U. S., at 688.\nNor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of\ncompetence mandated by Strickland. Pp. 23\u201326.\n     (d) Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster\nalso has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have un\nreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced. Pp. 26\u201331.\n        (1) To determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that\u201d\ndeath was not warranted, Strickland, supra, at 695, the aggravating\nevidence is reweighed \u201cagainst the totality of available mitigating\nevidence,\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534. Here, the State pre\n4                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    sented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty\n    phases. The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty\n    phase testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother and guilt-phase testimony\n    given by his brother. After considering the evidence, the jury re\n    turned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found sup\n    ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence. Pp. 26\u201329.\n           (2) There is no reasonable probability that the additional evi\n    dence presented at Pinholster\u2019s state proceedings would have\n    changed the verdict. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence largely duplicated the miti\n    gation evidence of his mother and brother at trial. To the extent that\n    there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of ques\n    tionable mitigating value. Dr. Woods\u2019 testimony would have opened\n    the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to\n    Pinholster\u2019s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems\n    could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation. The\n    remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. Given\n    what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in\n    state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court\u2019s\n    determination was unreasonable. Pp. 29\u201330.\n           (3) Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\n    question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and Rom\n    pilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, those cases lack the important \u201cdoubly\n    deferential\u201d standard of Strickland and AEDPA, and thus offer no\n    guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably de\n    termined that prejudice is lacking.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  On the evening of January 8, 1982, Pinholster solicited\nArt Corona and Paul David Brown to help him rob Mi\u00ad\nchael Kumar, a local drug dealer. On the way, they\nstopped at Lisa Tapar\u2019s house, where Pinholster put his\nbuck knife through her front door and scratched a swas\u00ad\ntika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The\nthree men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no\none at Kumar\u2019s house, broke in, and began ransacking the\nhome. They came across only a small amount of mari\u00ad\njuana before Kumar\u2019s friends, Thomas Johnson and\nRobert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling\nthe police.\n  Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through\nthe rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pinholster\nbacked Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and\nmoney and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson\ndropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.\nBeckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster\nattacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.\nPinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men\u2019s\nwallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Mean\u00ad\nwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, \u201c \u2018bury[ing] his\nknife to the hilt.\u2019 \u201d 35 Reporter\u2019s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).\nJohnson and Beckett died of their wounds.\n  Corona drove the three men to Pinholster\u2019s apartment.\nWhile in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, \u201c \u2018We got\n\u2019em, man, we got \u2019em good.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. At the apartment,\nPinholster washed his knife, and the three split the pro\u00ad\nceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of mari\u00ad\njuana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to \u201clay\nlow,\u201d Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks\nlater. Id., at 4955.

The prosecution brought numer\u00ad\nous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of\nfirst-degree murder.\n                             B\n  The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and\nWilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first\u00ad\ndegree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap\u00ad\npointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and\ninsisted on representing himself. During that time, the\nState had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him\nthat the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence\nduring the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of\ndeath.\n  The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.\nPinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an\nalibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into\nKumar\u2019s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982,\nand had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.\nPinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,\nwhile he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar\u2019s house to\nsteal more drugs and did not return for three hours.\nPinholster told the jury that he was a \u201cprofessional rob\u00ad\nber,\u201d not a murderer. 43 id., at 6204. He boasted of com\u00ad\nmitting hundreds of robberies over the previous six years\nbut insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The\njury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree\nmurder.\n  Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved\nto exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that\nthe prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence\nto be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar\nargued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was \u201cnot\npresently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.\u201d\n52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecu\u00ad\n4                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ntor \u201cpossibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.\u201d Ibid.\nThe trial court asked whether a continuance might be\nhelpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could\nnot think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster\u2019s\nmother and that additional time would not \u201cmake a great\ndeal of difference.\u201d Id., at 7257\u20137258. Three days later,\nafter hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster\nhad received notice while representing himself and denied\nthe motion to exclude.\n  The penalty phase was held before the same jury that\nhad convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight\nwitnesses, who testified about Pinholster\u2019s history of\nthreatening and violent behavior, including resisting\narrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with\njuvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary\nrecord. Defense counsel called only Pinholster\u2019s mother,\nBurnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster\u2019s\ntroubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin\u00ad\nholster\u2019s siblings, and described Pinholster as \u201ca perfect\ngentleman at home.\u201d Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not\ncall a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John\nStalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted\nPinholster\u2019s \u201cpsychopathic personality traits,\u201d diagnosed\nhim with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded\nthat he \u201cwas not under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance\u201d at the time of the murders. App.\n131.\n  After 2\u00bd days of deliberation, the jury unanimously\nvoted for death on each of the two murder counts. On\nmandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed\nthe judgment.

Represented by new counsel, Pinholster alleged,\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar\nhad failed to adequately investigate and present mitigat\u00ad\ning evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.\nPinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and\nlegal records, as well as declarations from family mem\u00ad\nbers, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who\ndiagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and\nseizure disorders. Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg\u2019s\nreport as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court unanimously and summarily1\ndenied Pinholster\u2019s penalty-phase ineffective-assistance\nclaim \u201con the substantive ground that it is without merit.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 302.\n  Pinholster filed a federal habeas petition in April 1997.\nHe reiterated his previous allegations about penalty-phase\nineffective assistance and also added new allegations that\nhis trial counsel had failed to furnish Dr. Stalberg with\nadequate background materials. In support of the new\nallegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating\nthat in 1984, Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel had provided him\nwith only some police reports and a 1978 probation report.\nDr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the\nmaterial that had since been gathered by Pinholster\u2019s\nhabeas counsel, he would have conducted \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d\nbefore concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a\npersonality disorder.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas held in abeyance to allow Pinholster to go back to\nstate court.\n   In August 1997, Pinholster filed his second state habeas\npetition, this time including Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration and\nrequesting judicial notice of the documents previously\nsubmitted in support of his first state habeas petition. His\nallegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of coun\u00ad\nsel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court again unanimously and sum\u00ad\nmarily denied the petition \u201con the substantive ground that\nit is without merit.\u201d2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 300.\n   Having presented Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration to the state\ncourt, Pinholster returned to the District Court. In No\u00ad\nvember 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffec\u00ad\ntive assistance of counsel were identical to those in his\nsecond state habeas petition. Both parties moved for\nsummary judgment and Pinholster also moved, in the\nalternative, for an evidentiary hearing.\n   The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.\n1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.\nBefore the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who\nstated that none of the new material he reviewed altered\nhis original diagnosis. Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr.\nWoods\u2019 conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar\ndisorder. Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at\nthe hearing. He presented two new medical experts: Dr.\nSophia Vinogradov, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinhol\u00ad\nster with organic personality syndrome and ruled out\nantisocial personality disorder, and Dr. Donald Olson, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 A majority also \u201c[s]eparately and independently\u201d denied several\n\nclaims, including penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel, as\nuntimely, successive, and barred by res judicata. Id., at 300. The State\nhas not argued that these procedural rulings constitute adequate and\nindependent state grounds that bar federal habeas review.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The State\ncalled Dr. F.

Applying pre-\nAEDPA standards, the court granted the habeas petition\n\u201cfor inadequacy of counsel by failure to investigate and\npresent mitigation evidence at the penalty hearing.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 262. After Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S.\n202 (2003), clarified that AEDPA applies to cases like\nPinholster\u2019s, the court amended its order but did not alter\nits conclusion. Over a dissent, a panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Pinholster v.\nAyers, 525 F. 3d 742 (2008).\n   On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals vacated the\npanel opinion and affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of\nhabeas relief. The en banc court held that the District\nCourt\u2019s evidentiary hearing was not barred by 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(e)(2). The court then determined that new evidence\nfrom the hearing could be considered in assessing whether\nthe California Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\u00ad\nlished Federal law\u201d under \u00a72254(d)(1). See 590 F. 3d, at\n666 (\u201cCongress did not intend to restrict the inquiry under\n\u00a72254(d)(1) only to the evidence introduced in the state\nhabeas court\u201d). Taking the District Court evidence into\naccount, the en banc court determined that the California\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in denying Pinholster\u2019s claim\nof penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   Three judges dissented and rejected the majority\u2019s\nconclusion that the District Court hearing was not barred\nby \u00a72254(e)(2). 590 F. 3d, at 689 (opinion of Kozinski,\n8                 CULLEN v.

S. ___ (2010). First, whether review under \u00a72254(d)(1)\npermits consideration of evidence introduced in an eviden\u00ad\ntiary hearing before the federal habeas court. Second,\nwhether the Court of Appeals properly granted Pinholster\nhabeas relief on his claim of penalty-phase ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\n                            II\n  We first consider the scope of the record for a\n\u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry. The State argues that review is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits. Pinholster contends\nthat evidence presented to the federal habeas court may\nalso be considered. We agree with the State.\n                              A\n   As amended by AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 sets several\nlimits on the power of a federal court to grant an applica\u00ad\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a state pris\u00ad\noner. Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain\nonly those applications alleging that a person is in state\ncustody \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.\u201d Sections 2254(b) and (c) provide\nthat a federal court may not grant such applications\nunless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has ex\u00ad\nhausted state remedies.\n   If an application includes a claim that has been \u201cadjudi\u00ad\ncated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d \u00a72254(d),\nan additional restriction applies.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12), and \u201chighly deferen\u00ad\ntial standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which\ndemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of\nthe doubt,\u201d Woodford v.

Id., at 25.\n   We now hold that review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is limited to\nthe record that was before the state court that adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the\npast tense, to a state-court adjudication that \u201cresulted in\u201d\na decision that was contrary to, or \u201cinvolved\u201d an unrea\u00ad\nsonable application of, established law. This backward\u00ad\nlooking language requires an examination of the state\u00ad\ncourt decision at the time it was made. It follows that the\nrecord under review is limited to the record in existence at\nthat same time\u23afi.e., the record before the state court.\n   This understanding of the text is compelled by \u201cthe\nbroader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d which demon\u00ad\nstrates Congress\u2019 intent to channel prisoners\u2019 claims first\nto the state courts.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas\ncourt and reviewed by that court in the first instance\neffectively de novo.\n  Limiting \u00a72254(d)(1) review to the state-court record is\nconsistent with our precedents interpreting that statu\u00ad\ntory provision. Our cases emphasize that review under\n\u00a72254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did.\nState-court decisions are measured against this Court\u2019s\nprecedents as of \u201cthe time the state court renders its deci\u00ad\nsion.\u201d Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372 (2003). To\ndetermine whether a particular decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d\nthen-established law, a federal court must consider\nwhether the decision \u201capplies a rule that contradicts\n[such] law\u201d and how the decision \u201cconfronts [the] set of\nfacts\u201d that were before the state court. Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 405, 406 (2000) (Terry Williams). If the\nstate-court decision \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal\nprinciple\u201d in existence at the time, a federal court must\nassess whether the decision \u201cunreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Id., at 413. It\nwould be strange to ask federal courts to analyze whether\na state court\u2019s adjudication resulted in a decision that\nunreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the\nstate court.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that there is nothing strange about al\u00ad\n\nlowing consideration of new evidence under \u00a72254(d)(1) because, in her\nview, it would not be \u201cso different\u201d from some other tasks that courts\nundertake. Post, at 13 (dissenting opinion). What makes the consid\u00ad\neration of new evidence strange is not how \u201cdifferent\u201d the task would\nbe, but rather the notion that a state court can be deemed to have\nunreasonably applied federal law to evidence it did not even know\nexisted. We cannot comprehend how exactly a state court would have\nany control over its application of law to matters beyond its knowledge.\nAdopting JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s approach would not take seriously\nAEDPA\u2019s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions\nand would effectively treat the statute as no more than a \u201c \u2018mood\u2019 that\nthe Federal Judiciary must respect,\u201d Terry Williams, 529 U. S., at 386\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our recent decision in Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S.\n465 (2007), is consistent as well with our holding here. We\nexplained that \u201c[b]ecause the deferential standards pre\u00ad\nscribed by \u00a72254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a\nfederal court must take into account those standards in\ndeciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d\nId., at 474. In practical effect, we went on to note, this\nmeans that when the state-court record \u201cprecludes habeas\nrelief\u201d under the limitations of \u00a72254(d), a district court is\n\u201cnot required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 474\n(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recognition that\n\u201can evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can\nbe resolved by reference to the state court record\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420 (2000) (Michael Williams), as sup\u00ad\nporting the contrary view.        The question there was\nwhether the lower court had correctly determined that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) barred the petitioner\u2019s request for a federal\nevidentiary hearing.4 Michael Williams did not concern\nwhether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be\nconsidered under \u00a72254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at\nissue in that case was even subject to \u00a72254(d); the rest\nhad not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court\nproceedings. See id., at 429 (\u201cPetitioner did not develop,\nor raise, his claims . . . until he filed his federal habeas\npetition\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(opinion of Stevens, J.).\n  4 If a prisoner has \u201cfailed to develop the factual basis of a claim in\n\nState court proceedings,\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2) bars a federal court from holding\nan evidentiary hearing, unless the applicant meets certain statutory\nrequirements.\n  5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s suggestion that Michael Williams \u201crejected\u201d\n\nthe conclusion here, see post, at 15, is thus quite puzzling. In the\npassage that she quotes, see ibid., the Court merely explains that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) should be interpreted in a way that does not preclude a\nstate prisoner, who was diligent in state habeas court and who can\n12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   If anything, the decision in Michael Williams supports\nour holding. The lower court in that case had determined\nthat the one claim subject to \u00a72254(d)(1) did not satisfy\nthat statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this\nCourt concluded that it was \u201cunnecessary to reach the\nquestion whether \u00a72254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]\nhearing on th[at] claim.\u201d Id., at 444. That conclusion is\nfully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro\u00ad\nduced in federal court is irrelevant to \u00a72254(d)(1) review.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on Holland v. Jackson,\n542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam), was also mistaken. In\nHolland, we initially stated that \u201cwhether a state court\u2019s\ndecision was unreasonable [under \u00a72254(d)(1)] must be\nassessed in light of the record the court had before it.\u201d Id.,\nat 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu\u00ad\nment what some Courts of Appeals had held\u23afthat\n\u00a72254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does\nnot apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new\nevidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in\nstate court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide\nthat question because regardless, the hearing should have\nbeen barred by \u00a72254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump\u00ad\ntion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court\nhas no bearing on \u00a72254(d)(1) review. If a claim has\nbeen adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed\u00ad\neral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsatisfy \u00a72254(d), from receiving an evidentiary hearing.\n  6 In Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74 (2005) (per curiam), on which\n\nthe Court of Appeals also relied, we made the same assumption. Id., at\n79\u201380 (discussing the State\u2019s \u201cHolland argument\u201d).\n  7 Pinholster and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR place great weight on the fact\n\nthat \u00a72254(d)(2) includes the language \u201cin light of the evidence pre\u00ad\nsented in the State court proceeding,\u201d whereas \u00a72254(d)(1) does not.\nSee post, at 6\u20137.

Section 2254(e)(2)\nimposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas\ncourts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.\nSee Landrigan, supra, at 473 (noting that district courts,\nunder AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an\nevidentiary hearing). Like \u00a72254(d)(1), it carries out\n\u201cAEDPA\u2019s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federal\u00ad\nism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review\n[a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the\nfirst instance.\u201d Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).8\n   Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where\n\u00a72254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For exam\u00ad\nple, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall\nwithin the scope of \u00a72254(d), which applies only to claims\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\u201d At\na minimum, therefore, \u00a72254(e)(2) still restricts the discre\u00ad\ntion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence\nwhen deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the\nmerits in state court. See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 427\u2013429.9\n   Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfrom \u00a72254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress\u2019 belief that such lan\u00ad\nguage was unnecessary as it does anything else.\n  8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s argument that \u00a72254(d)(1) must be read in a\n\nway that \u201caccommodates\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2), see post, at 9, rests on a funda\u00ad\nmental misunderstanding of \u00a72254(e)(2). The focus of that section is\nnot on \u201cpreserving the opportunity\u201d for hearings, post, at 9, but rather\non limiting the discretion of federal district courts in holding hearings.\nWe see no need in this case to address the proper application of\n\u00a72254(e)(2). See n. 20, infra. But see post, at 12 (suggesting that we\nhave given \u00a72254(e)(2) \u201can unnaturally cramped reading\u201d).\n  9 In all events, of course, the requirements of \u00a7\u00a72254(a) through (c)\n\nremain significant limitations on the power of a federal court to grant\nhabeas relief.\n14                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is\ndesigned to strongly discourage them from doing so.\nProvisions like \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and (e)(2) ensure that\n\u201c[f]ederal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative\nforum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made\ninsufficient effort to pursue in state proceedings.\u201d Id., at\n437; see also Richter, 562 U.

No party disputes that Pinholster\u2019s federal\npetition alleges an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nthat had been included in both of Pinholster\u2019s state habeas\npetitions.

In these circumstances, Pinholster can satisfy the\n\u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of \u00a72254(d)(1) only by\nshowing that \u201cthere was no reasonable basis\u201d for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision.

See Brief for Petitioner 28\u201331; Reply Brief for Petitioner 4\u20135; Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 18. Pinholster disagrees and argues that the evidence\nadduced in the evidentiary hearing simply supports his alleged claim.\nBrief for Respondent 33\u201337.\n  We need not resolve this dispute because, even accepting Pinholster\u2019s\nposition, he is not entitled to federal habeas relief. Pinholster has\nfailed to show that the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied\nclearly established federal law on the record before that court, infra, at\n18\u201323, 26\u201330, which brings our analysis to an end.

By contrast, the most favorable approach for Pinholster\nwould be review of only the second state habeas proceeding, the record\nof which includes all of the evidence that Pinholster ever submitted in\nstate habeas. We have not previously ruled on how to proceed in these\ncircumstances, and we need not do so here. Even taking the approach\nmost favorable to Pinholster, and reviewing only whether the California\nSupreme Court was objectively unreasonable in the second state\nhabeas proceeding, we find that Pinholster has failed to satisfy\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The Court of Appeals dissent\ndescribed one possible strategy:\n    \u201c[Pinholster\u2019s attorneys] were fully aware that they\n    would have to deal with mitigation sometime during\n    the course of the trial, did spend considerable time\n    and effort investigating avenues for mitigation[,] and\n    made a reasoned professional judgment that the best\n    way to serve their client would be to rely on the fact\n    that they never got [the required \u00a7190.3] notice and\n    hope the judge would bar the state from putting on\n    their aggravation witnesses.\u201d 590 F. 3d, at 701\u2013702\n    (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.).\nFurther, if their motion was denied, counsel were pre\u00ad\npared to present only Pinholster\u2019s mother in the penalty\nphase to create sympathy not for Pinholster, but for his\nmother. After all, the \u201c \u2018family sympathy\u2019 \u201d mitigation\ndefense was known to the defense bar in California at the\ntime and had been used by other attorneys. Id., at 707.\nRather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dett\u00ad\nmar\u2019s arguments were part of this trial strategy. See\nGentry, supra, at 8 (\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption that\n[counsel took certain actions] for tactical reasons rather\nthan through sheer neglect\u201d (citing Strickland, supra, at\n690)).\n  The state-court record supports the idea that Pinhol\u00ad\nster\u2019s counsel acted strategically to get the prosecution\u2019s\naggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if\nthat failed, to put on Pinholster\u2019s mother.

But during\ncross-examination, Pinholster admitted that he had previ\u00ad\nously been convicted of using a knife in a kidnaping.\nPinholster also said he was a white supremacist and that\nhe frequently carved swastikas into other people\u2019s prop\u00ad\nerty as \u201ca sideline to robbery.\u201d 44 id., at 6246.\n   Trial counsel\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Stalberg, had\nconcluded that Pinholster showed no significant signs or\nsymptoms of mental disorder or defect other than his\n\u201cpsychopathic personality traits.\u201d App. 131. Dr. Stalberg\nwas aware of Pinholster\u2019s hyperactivity as a youngster,\nhospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epilep\u00ad\ntic disorder, and history of drug dependency. Neverthe\u00ad\nless, Dr. Stalberg told counsel that Pinholster did not\nappear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly\nintoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did\nnot have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct.\n   Given these impediments, it would have been a reason\u00ad\nable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy\nfor Pinholster\u2019s mother. In fact, such a family sympathy\n22                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense is precisely how the State understood defense\ncounsel\u2019s strategy.

And in her closing argument, the\nprosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel\u2019s strat\u00ad\negy by pointing out, \u201cEven the most heinous person born,\neven Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved\nhim.\u201d 53 id., at 7452.\n   Pinholster\u2019s only response to this evidence is a series of\ndeclarations from Brainard submitted with Pinholster\u2019s\nfirst state habeas petition, seven years after the trial.\nBrainard declares that he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of inter\u00ad\nviewing any family members (other than Pinholster\u2019s\nmother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting\nto secure Pinholster\u2019s school or medical records, or of\ninterviewing any former teachers or counselors. Pet. for\nWrit of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616 (Cal.), Exh. 3.\nBrainard also declares that Dettmar was primarily re\u00ad\nsponsible for mental health issues in the case, but he has\n\u201cno recollection\u201d of Dettmar ever having secured Pinhol\u00ad\nster\u2019s medical records.

The \u201cnew\u201d\nevidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at\ntrial. School and medical records basically substantiate\nthe testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother and brother. Decla\u00ad\nrations from Pinholster\u2019s siblings support his mother\u2019s\ntestimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain\nthat Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even\nwooden boards.\n   To the extent the state habeas record includes new\nfactual allegations or evidence, much of it is of question\u00ad\nable mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods\nto testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinhol\u00ad\nster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state\nexpert. See, e.g., Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10\u201312) (taking into account\nthat certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the\npetitioner to further aggravating evidence).

Cf. Atkins v. Virginia, 536\nU. S. 304, 321 (2002) (recognizing that mitigating evidence\ncan be a \u201ctwo-edged sword\u201d that juries might find to show\nfuture dangerousness).\n   The remaining new material in the state habeas record\nis sparse.

Mostly, there are just a few new details\nabout Pinholster\u2019s childhood.       Pinholster apparently\nlooked like his biological father, whom his grandparents\n\u201cloathed.\u201d Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616\n(Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandpar\u00ad\nents \u201cspanked or disciplined\u201d the kids, Pinholster \u201calways\ngot the worst of it.\u201d Ibid. Pinholster was mostly unsuper\u00ad\nvised and \u201cdidn\u2019t get much love,\u201d because his mother and\nstepfather were always working and \u201cwere more concerned\nwith their own lives than the welfare of their kids.\u201d Id., at\n2. Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster\u2019s\nschooling. Finally, Pinholster\u2019s aunt once saw the children\nmixing flour and water to make something to eat, al\u00ad\nthough \u201c[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and\nfoods of that ilk.\u201d Id., at 1.\n   Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol\u00ad\nster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s determination was unreason\u00ad\nable. Having already heard much of what is included in\nthe state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of\ndeath. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely\nhave undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by\nPinholster\u2019s mother.

S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) must\ntake into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.\nAs the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence\nreceived in the hearing in federal court gives \u00a72254(e)(2)\nan implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results\nthat Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of\nother provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law\non \u201ccause and prejudice.\u201d See post, at 9\u201312 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.).\n  Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court\nshould be rare. The petitioner generally must have made\na diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence\non which he seeks to rely. See \u00a72254(e)(2); Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420, 433\u2013434 (2000). If that requirement\nis not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual\npredicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if,\namong other things, \u201cthe facts underlying the claim would\nbe sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\n2                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense.\u201d \u00a72254(e)(2)(B).\n   Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence\nstandard adopted in Williams v. Taylor, supra, a hearing\nshould not be held in federal court unless the new evi\ndence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and\ncould not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.\nSection 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but\nit does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other\nsituations. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473\u2013\n474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to\nreserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the\nstate courts acted unreasonably. See \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1), (2),\n(e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas\nrelief on the basis of evidence that could have been but\nwas not offered in state court would upset this scheme.\n   In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the\ndissent from the Court of Appeals\u2019 en banc decision, see\nPinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 688\u2013691 (CA9 2009)\n(opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal\ncourt hearing should not have been held because respon\ndent did not diligently present his new evidence to the\nCalifornia courts. And I join all but Part II of the opinion\nof the Court, as I agree that the decision of the state court\nrepresented a reasonable application of clearly established\nSupreme Court precedent in light of the state-court record.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

I do not join\nPart III, for I would send this case back to the Court of\nAppeals so that it can apply the legal standards that Part\nII announces to the complex facts of this case. Compare\nante, at 14\u201331 (majority opinion), with post, at 17\u201342\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Like the Court, I believe that its understanding of\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA\u2019s hearing\nsection, \u00a72254(e), without work to do. An offender who\nbelieves he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a\nclaim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the\nstate courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court\nmay review that rejection on the basis of the materials\nconsidered by the state court. If the federal habeas court\nfinds that the state-court decision fails (d)\u2019s test (or if (d)\ndoes not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.\n   For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s facts (deciding that, even if those facts\nwere true, federal law was not violated), then (after find\ning the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing\nmight be needed to determine whether the facts alleged\nwere indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on\na state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade\n2                  CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nquate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the\npetitioner\u2019s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or\nif the state-court rejection rested on only one of several\nrelated federal grounds (e.g., that counsel\u2019s assistance was\nnot \u201cinadequate\u201d), then, if the federal court found that the\nstate court\u2019s decision in respect to the ground it decided\nviolated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider\nother related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,\nwhether the counsel\u2019s \u201cinadequate\u201d assistance was also\nprejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)\nhearing is needed as well.\n   In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)\nhearing is needed until we know whether the state court,\nin rejecting Pinholster\u2019s claim on the basis presented to\nthat state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower\ncourts\u2019 analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)\n   There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to\nintroduce evidence that was not first presented to the\nstate courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is\nwithout recourse to present new evidence. He can always\nreturn to state court presenting new evidence not previ\nously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he\nmight be able to return to federal court to make claims\nrelated to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA\u2019s limita\ntions on successive petitions. See \u00a72244.\n   I am not trying to predict the future course of these\nproceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is\nnot designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas\npetitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to con\nsider most matters and to insist that federal courts prop\nerly respect state-court determinations.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Congress recognized as much when it en\nacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the\nintroduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceed\nings in certain limited circumstances. See 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(e)(2). Under the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of\n\u00a72254(d)(1), however, federal courts must turn a blind eye\nto new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s threshold obstacle to federal habeas\nrelief\u2014even when it is clear that the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief in light of that evidence. In reading\nthe statute to \u201ccompe[l]\u201d this harsh result, ante, at 9,\nthe Court ignores a key textual difference between\n\u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous\nunderstanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in\nfact, inform the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry. I therefore dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s first holding.\n   I also disagree with the Court that, even if the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record,\nrespondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision denying his ineffec\n2                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). There is no reason for the majority to decide\nwhether the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state\ncourt record because Pinholster satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on\neither the state- or federal-court record.\n                             I\n  The Court first holds that, in determining whether a\nstate-court decision is an unreasonable application of\nSupreme Court precedent under \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201creview . . . is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d Ante, at 9. New\nevidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is\nnow irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). This holding is unnecessary to pro\nmote AEDPA\u2019s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the\nprovision\u2019s text, the structure of the statute, and our\nprecedents.\n                              A\n   To understand the significance of the majority\u2019s holding,\nit is important to view the issue in context. AEDPA\u2019s\nentire structure\u2014which gives state courts the opportunity\nto decide factual and legal questions in the first instance\u2014\nensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas pro\nceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B.\nOstrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in\nU. S. District Courts 35\u201336 (2007) (evidentiary hearings\nunder AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and\n9.5 percent of capital cases). Even absent the new restric\ntion created by today\u2019s holding, AEDPA erects multiple\nhurdles to a state prisoner\u2019s ability to introduce new evi\ndence in a federal habeas proceeding.\n   First, \u201c[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas\npetitioner challenging a state conviction must first at\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

With certain narrow exceptions, federal\ncourts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new\nevidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted\nin state court.1 The exhaustion requirement thus reserves\nto state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual\ndisputes relevant to a state prisoner\u2019s claim.            See\nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999).\n  Second, the exhaustion requirement is \u201ccomplement[ed]\u201d\nby the standards set forth in \u00a72254(d). Harrington, 562\nU.

Under this provision, a fed\neral court may not grant habeas relief on any \u201cclaim that\nwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d\nunless the adjudication\n        \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n     involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n     lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States; or\n        \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n     reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n     evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nThese standards \u201ccontrol whether to grant habeas relief.\u201d\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474 (2007). Accord\ningly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner\nseeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy\nthese standards, there is no reason for a hearing. See id.,\nat 481. In such a case, the district court may exercise its\n\u201cdiscretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Ibid.; see also\ninfra, at 13\u201314.

See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 750 (1991).\n4                     CULLEN v.

Taylor, 529 U. S.\n420, 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). Thus, \u00a72254(e)(2)\nprovides:\n     \u201cIf the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis\n     of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall\n     not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless\n     the applicant shows that\u2014\n        \u201c(A) the claim relies on\u2014\n        \u201c(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroac\n     tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme\n     Court, that was previously unavailable; or\n        \u201c(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been\n     previously discovered through the exercise of due dili\n     gence; and\n        \u201c(B) the facts underlying the claim would be suffi\n     cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\n     that but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact\n     finder would have found the applicant guilty of the\n     underlying offense.\u201d\nIn Michael Williams, we construed the opening clause of\nthis provision\u2014which triggers the bar on evidentiary\nhearings\u2014to apply when \u201cthere is lack of diligence, or\nsome greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the\nprisoner\u2019s counsel.\u201d2 Id., at 432.

In particular, Con\ngress\u2019 decision to include in AEDPA a provision,\n\u00a72254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in\ncertain circumstances provides further evidence that\nCongress did not intend to limit the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry to\nthe state-court record in every case.\n  We have long recognized that some diligent habeas\npetitioners are unable to develop all of the facts support\ning their claims in state court.4 As discussed above, in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529 U.

Michael Williams,\n529 U. S., at 436; see also \u00a72254(e)(2). Importantly, it did\nnot impose any express limit on evidentiary hearings for\npetitioners who had been diligent in state court. See id.,\nat 436 (\u201c[T]he statute does not equate prisoners who exer\ncise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do\nnot\u201d).

S., at 473.\n   Faced with situations in which a diligent petitioner\noffers additional evidence in federal court, the courts of\nappeals have taken two approaches to applying\n\u00a72254(d)(1). Some courts have held that when a federal\ncourt admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated\non the merits in state court, \u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall and the federal court may review the claim de novo.\nSee ante, at 12; Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649, 653\n(2004) (per curiam); see, e.g., Winston v. Kelly, 592 F. 3d\n535, 555\u2013556 (CA4 2010). I agree with the majority\u2019s\nrejection of this approach. See ante, at 12. It would un\ndermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to de\ncline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim\nbecause the state court, through no fault of its own,\nlacked all the relevant evidence.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Of\n       course, \u00a72254(d)(1) only applies when a state court has adjudi\ncated a claim on the merits. There may be situations in which new\nevidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits gives rise to an\naltogether different claim. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311\n(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give rise\nto a separate claim under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)). The\nmajority opinion does not foreclose this possibility.\n  I assume that the majority does not intend to suggest that review is\nlimited to the state-court record when a petitioner\u2019s inability to develop\nthe facts supporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself.

These courts have held\nthat \u00a72254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence\nproperly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the\nreasonableness of the state-court decision. See Pinholster\nv. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (\u201cIf the\nevidence is admissible under Michael Williams or\n\u00a72254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner\u2019s\nclaims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in\nevaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the\nstate habeas court was a reasonable application of Su\npreme Court law\u201d); accord, Wilson v. Mazzuca, 570 F. 3d\n490, 500 (CA2 2009); Pecoraro v. Walls, 286 F. 3d 439, 443\n(CA7 2002); Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F. 3d 941, 952 (CA5\n2001). This approach accommodates the competing goals,\nreflected in \u00a7\u00a72254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according defer\nence to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving\nthe opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence\nto the federal court when they were unable to do so in\nstate court.\n  The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I\nam aware, no court of appeals has adopted: \u00a72254(d)(1)\ncontinues to apply when a petitioner has additional evi\ndence that he was unable to present to the state court, but\nthe district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding\nwhether the petitioner has satisfied \u00a72254(d)(1). The\nproblem with this approach is its potential to bar federal\nhabeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot\npresent new evidence to a state court.\n   Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently at\ntempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness\nstatements in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that\nthe withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level\nof materiality required under Brady. Before the time for\n10                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfiling a federal habeas petition has expired, however, a\nstate court orders the State to disclose additional docu\nments the petitioner had timely requested under the\nState\u2019s public records Act. The disclosed documents reveal\nthat the State withheld other exculpatory witness state\nments, but state law would not permit the petitioner to\npresent the new evidence in a successive petition.6\n   Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented\nhis Brady claim to the state court at all, his claim would\nbe deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to\nshow cause and prejudice to overcome the default. See\nMichael Williams, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1, supra.\nIf, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a Brady\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it\nis unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas\nrelief after today\u2019s holding. What may have been a rea\nsonable decision on the state-court record may no longer\nbe reasonable in light of the new evidence. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 436 (1995) (materiality of Brady\nevidence is viewed \u201ccollectively, not item by item\u201d). Be\ncause the state court adjudicated the petitioner\u2019s Brady\nclaim on the merits, \u00a72254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet,\nunder the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1), a fed\neral court is now prohibited from considering the new\nevidence in determining the reasonableness of the state\ncourt decision.\n   The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72254(d)(1) thus sug\ngests the anomalous result that petitioners with new\nclaims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain fed\neral habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for\ntheir default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence\nsupporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See, e.g., id., at 37\u201338 (statement by counsel for the respondent\n\nwarden that Virginia law bars all successive habeas applications, even\nin cases where the petitioner has new evidence).\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

That the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good\nreason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong. See\nKeeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1992) (\u201c[I]t is\n. . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly\nassert a federal claim in state court and failing in state\ncourt to properly develop such a claim\u201d).\n    The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting\nthat my hypothetical petitioner \u201cmay well [have] a new\nclaim.\u201d7 Ante, at 14, n. 10. This suggestion is puzzling.\nNew evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it\nmerely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudi\ncated on the merits.8 The majority presumably means\nto suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain\nfederal-court review of his new evidence if he can show\ncause and prejudice for his failure to present the \u201cnew\u201d\nclaim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the\nfederal court would review the purportedly \u201cnew\u201d claim de\nnovo. The majority\u2019s approach thus threatens to replace\ndeferential review of new evidence under \u00a72254(d)(1) with\nde novo review of new evidence in the form of \u201cnew\u201d\nclaims.9 Because it is unlikely that Congress intended\nde novo review\u2014the result suggested by the majority\u2019s\nopinion\u2014it must have intended for district courts to\nconsider newly discovered evidence in conducting the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The majority declines, however, to provide any guidance to the lower\n\ncourts on how to distinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new\nclaims.\n  8 Even if it can fairly be argued that my hypothetical petitioner has a\n\nnew claim, the majority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with\nnew evidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evi\ndence to a federal court.\n  9 In this vein, it is the majority\u2019s approach that \u201cwould not take seri\n\nously AEDPA\u2019s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court\ndecisions.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 3.\n12                    CULLEN v.

See ante, at 9\u201310 (\u201cIt would be contrary to\n[AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to\novercome an adverse state-court decision with new evi\ndence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed\nby that court in the first instance effectively de novo\u201d).10\nJUSTICE BREYER takes the same position. See ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(AEDPA is designed \u201cto give the State a first opportunity\nto consider most matters\u201d). I fully agree that habeas\npetitioners must attempt to present evidence to state\ncourts in the first instance, as does JUSTICE ALITO, see\nante, at 2. Where I disagree with the majority is in my\nunderstanding that \u00a72254(e)(2) already accomplishes this\nresult.    By reading \u00a72254(d)(1) to do the work of\n\u00a72254(e)(2), the majority gives \u00a72254(e)(2) an unnaturally\ncramped reading. As a result, the majority either has\nforeclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who,\nthrough no fault of their own, were unable to present\nexculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated\ntheir claims or has created a new set of procedural com\nplexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the\navailability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.\n                             3\n  These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of\nappeals that have concluded that a federal court should\nassess the reasonableness of a state court\u2019s application of\nclearly established federal law under \u00a72254(d)(1) in light\nof evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary\nhearing.

Under \u00a72254(d)(1), federal courts routinely\nengage in analysis that the state court itself might never\nhave conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a\nstate court summarily denies a claim without explanation,\nas the California Supreme Court did here, district courts\nmust deny habeas relief pursuant to \u00a72254(d)(1) so long as\n\u201cthere is any reasonable argument\u201d supporting the denial\nof the petitioner\u2019s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court\ndecision unreasonably applied clearly established federal\nlaw when the state court issued a reasoned decision but\nfailed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,\n537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a\nstate court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief\nin light of newly discovered evidence is not so different\nthan determining whether there is any reasonable basis\nfor a state court\u2019s unreasoned decision.\n   Admittedly, the text of \u00a72254(d)(1), standing alone, does\nnot compel either reading of that provision. But constru\ning \u00a72254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop\nerly introduced in federal court best accords with the text\nof \u00a72254(d)(2) and AEDPA\u2019s structure as a whole. By\ninterpreting \u00a72254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners\nfrom gaming the system\u2014the very purpose of\n\u00a72254(e)(2)\u2014the majority potentially has put habeas relief\nout of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious\nclaims based on new evidence.\n                            C\n  The majority claims that its holding is \u201cconsistent\u201d with\nour case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our\ncases reflect our previous understanding that evidence\nproperly admitted pursuant to \u00a72254(e)(2) is relevant to\nthe \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis.\n  In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today\u2019s\nopinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay\n14                    CULLEN v.

As noted above, we\nadmonished district courts to consider whether a peti\ntioner\u2019s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy \u00a72254(d)\nin determining whether to grant a hearing. After high\nlighting the deference owed to state courts under\n\u00a7\u00a72254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:\n     \u201cIn deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,\n     a federal court must consider whether such a hearing\n     could enable an applicant to prove the petition\u2019s fac\n     tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\n     applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer\n     ential standards prescribed by \u00a72254 control whether\n     to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into\n     account those standards in deciding whether an evi\n     dentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d 550 U. S., at 474 (ci\n     tation omitted).\nBy instructing district courts to consider the \u00a72254(d)\nstandards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must\nhave understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing\ncould be considered in the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9\n(\u201cThe whole point of Landrigan\u2019s admonition that the\ncourt must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye\non \u00a72254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not\njustify federal fact-finding in view of \u00a72254(d)(1), but that\nother proffers of proof will\u201d).11\n   In Michael Williams, the warden argued that\n\u00a72254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti\ntioner was unable to develop the factual record in state\ncourt, \u201cwhether or not through his own fault or neglect.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan.

Under the warden\u2019s argument, a peti\ntioner who did not develop the record in state court, what\never the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence\nto the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we\nobserved:\n     \u201cA prisoner who developed his claim in state court and\n     can prove the state court\u2019s decision was \u2018contrary to,\n     or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es\n     tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States,\u2019 is not barred from obtain\n     ing relief by \u00a72254(d)(1). If the opening clause of\n     \u00a72254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear\n     ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but\n     remained undeveloped in state court because, for in\n     stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner\n     lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence\n     could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he\n     could satisfy \u00a72254(d).\u201d Id., at 434 (citation omitted;\n     emphasis added).\nA petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly\nbe unable to \u201csatisfy \u00a72254(d)\u201d without introducing the\nconcealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects\nour understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti\ntioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court\nto prove the facts necessary to satisfy \u00a72254(d). To avoid\nforeclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded\nthat \u00a72254(e)(2) could not bear the warden\u2019s \u201charsh read\ning,\u201d which essentially would have held petitioners strictly\nat fault for their inability to develop the facts in state\ncourt.

S. 362 (2000)\n(Terry Williams), we interpreted \u00a72254(d)(1) to ask\nwhether the state-court decision \u201cidentifies the correct\ngoverning legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\nprisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Id., at 413. However, we had no reason\nto decide whether the \u00a72254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to\nthe state-court record, as the District Court did not hold\nan evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.\n   In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that \u201cwe have made\nclear that whether a state court\u2019s decision was unreason\nable must be assessed in light of the record the court had\nbefore it.\u201d 542 U.

See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation as Amicus Curiae 26. This argument is based on amicus\u2019\nunderstanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second\npetition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has\nnot argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural\nground. See ante, at 6, n. 2. When a state court denies two petitions on\nthe merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second\npetition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim,\nI see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the\nfirst decision was unreasonable.\n18                 CULLEN v.

This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding\nwhether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer\naggravating evidence. Pinholster\u2019s court-appointed attor\nney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be\nprecluded from offering aggravating evidence:\n     \u201cI am not presently prepared to offer anything by way\n     of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation,\n     the people would have the right to rebuttal with or\n     without notice.\n        \u201cI took the position, since the people had not given\n     notice, I had not prepared any evidence by way of miti\n     gation.

(emphasis added).\nUndoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need addi\ntional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the\ncourt asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be\nhelpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the\noffer on the spot, stating: \u201cI think we would probably still\ngo forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes\nto mind is the defendant\u2019s mother.

After\nhearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster\u2019s motion to\npreclude aggravating evidence.\n   At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one\nwitness: Pinholster\u2019s mother, Burnice Brashear.

His counsel later\nmoved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In\ndenying the motion, the trial judge stated, \u201cThe evidence\nwhich the defense offered concerning the defendant\u2019s\nextenuation was merely some testimony from his mother\nthat was not persuasive. His mother did not, in the court\u2019s\nopinion, present any evidence which the court would find\nto be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.\nNo witness supplied such evidence.\u201d 54 id., at 7514.\n                                 2\n  After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on\nappeal, Pinholster filed a habeas petition in the California\nSupreme Court alleging, among other things, that his\ncounsel had \u201cunreasonably failed to investigate, prepare\nand present available mitigating evidence during penalty\nphase.\u201d Record ER\u2013103.\n  Pinholster\u2019s state-court petition included 121 exhibits.\nIn a series of declarations, his trial attorney Harry\nBrainard (who had by then been disbarred) confirmed\nwhat Dettmar had forthrightly told the trial court:\nBrainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to\npresent mitigation evidence.15 See id., at ER\u2013333 (\u201cMr.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 15 By the time of Pinholster\u2019s state-court habeas petition, Dettmar\n\nwas deceased.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Pinholster\u2019s elder brother was ar\nrested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a\n14-year-old with a deadly weapon.

The majority\u2019s conjecture\nthat counsel had in fact prepared a mitigation defense,\nbased primarily on isolated entries in counsel\u2019s billing\nrecords, requires it to assume that Dettmar was lying to\nthe trial judge.20\n   In any event, even if Pinholster\u2019s counsel had a strategic\nreason for their actions, that would not automatically\nrender their actions reasonable. For example, had counsel\ndecided their best option was to move to exclude the ag\ngravating evidence, it would have been unreasonable to\nforgo a mitigation investigation on the hope that the mo\ntion would be granted. With a client\u2019s life at stake, it\nwould \u201cflou[t] prudence,\u201d Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.

The cited\nentries predating that event show only that counsel conducted about\none day\u2019s worth of investigation\u2014consisting of talking to Brashear and\nresearching epilepsy\u2014two months before the penalty phase.

There is no evidence in the records that counsel\nactually planned to present mitigating evidence. Indeed, their complete\nfailure to follow up on any of the information they learned in their\nminimal investigation only confirms that they were not planning to\npresent mitigating evidence.

No rea\nsonable attorney would pursue such a risky strategy. I do\nnot understand the majority to suggest otherwise.\n  Instead, I understand the majority\u2019s conclusion that\ncounsel\u2019s actions were reasonable to rest on its belief that\nthey did have a backup plan: a family-sympathy defense.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the majority commits the\nsame Strickland error that we corrected, applying\n\u00a72254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds a purportedly \u201ctactical\njudgment\u201d to be reasonable without assessing \u201cthe ade\nquacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that] judgmen[t],\u201d\n539 U.

As we stated in Strickland:\n    \u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made af\n    ter less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n    investigations or to make a reasonable decision that\n    makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\n    ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to inves\n    tigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in\n    all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n    deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d 466 U. S., at 690\u2013\n    691.\nWe have repeatedly applied this principle since Strick\nland. See Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 9); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.

There, counsel\u2019s in\nvestigation was limited to three sources: psychological\ntesting, a presentencing report, and Department of Social\nServices records. 539 U. S., at 523\u2013524. The records\nrevealed that the petitioner\u2019s mother was an alcoholic,\nthat he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that\nhe was frequently absent from school, and that on one\noccasion, his mother left him alone for days without food.\nId., at 525. In these circumstances, we concluded, \u201cany\nreasonably competent attorney would have realized that\npursuing these leads was necessary to making an in\nformed choice among possible defenses.\u201d Ibid. Accord\ningly, we held, the state court\u2019s assumption that counsel\u2019s\ninvestigation was adequate was an unreasonable applica\ntion of Strickland. 539 U. S., at 528.23\n   This case is remarkably similar to Wiggins. As the\nmajority reads the record, counsel\u2019s mitigation investiga\ntion consisted of talking to Pinholster\u2019s mother, consulting\nwith Dr. Stalberg, and researching epilepsy.24 Ante, at 20.\nWhat little information counsel gleaned from this \u201crudi\nmentary\u201d investigation, Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 524, would\nhave led any reasonable attorney \u201cto investigate further,\u201d\nid., at 527. Counsel learned from Pinholster\u2019s mother that\nhe attended a class for educationally handicapped chil\ndren, that a psychologist had recommended placing him in\na mental institution, and that he spent time in a state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 As the majority notes, see ante, at 24\u201325, Wiggins\u2019 trial counsel\n\nacknowledged that the investigation he conducted was inconsistent\nwith standard practice in Maryland. See 539 U. S., at 524. We inde\npendently concluded, however, that the investigation \u201cwas also unrea\nsonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in the . . . records.\u201d\nId., at 525 (emphasis added).\n  24 The majority also posits that Brainard likely spent time preparing\n\nPinholster\u2019s brother Terry. However, Terry averred in a declaration\nthat Pinholster\u2019s attorneys \u201cnever asked [him] any questions relating to\nScott\u2019s background or [their] family history.\u201d Record ER\u2013313.\n30                CULLEN v.

Yet counsel\nmade no effort to obtain the readily available evidence\nsuggested by the information they learned, such as Pin\nholster\u2019s schooling or medical records, or to contact\nPinholster\u2019s school authorities. They did not contact Dr.\nDubin or the many other health-care providers who had\ntreated Pinholster. Put simply, counsel \u201cfailed to act while\npotentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in\nthe face.\u201d Bobby, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citing\nWiggins, 539 U.

S., at 526. Dettmar told the trial judge\nthat he was unprepared to present any mitigation evi\ndence. The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on\ncan be described, at best, as \u201chalfhearted.\u201d Ibid. Counsel\nmade no effort to bolster Brashear\u2019s self-interested testi\nmony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor\neffectively emphasized in closing argument. And because\nthey did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize\nthat Brashear\u2019s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad\napple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.\n   In denying Pinholster\u2019s claim, the California Supreme\nCourt necessarily overlooked Strickland\u2019s clearly estab\nlished admonition that \u201cstrategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to\nthe extent that reasonable professional judgments support\nthe limitations.\u201d 466 U. S., at 690\u2013691. As in Wiggins, in\nlight of the information available to Pinholster\u2019s counsel, it\nis plain that \u201creasonable professional judgments\u201d could not\nhave supported their woefully inadequate investigation.25\n466 U. S., at 691. Accordingly, the California Supreme\nCourt could not reasonably have concluded that Pinholster\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 The majority chastises the Court of Appeals for \u201cattributing strict\nrules to this Court\u2019s recent case law.\u201d Ante, at 24. I agree that courts\nshould not interpret our cases to prescribe strict rules regarding the\nrequired scope of mitigation investigations. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545\nU. S. 374, 394 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (noting \u201cour longstand\ning case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney\u2019s per\nformance was unconstitutionally deficient under Strickland\u201d). The\nNinth Circuit, however, did no such thing. It appropriately gave\nthoughtful consideration to the guideposts contained in these cases,\njust as we have previously done. See, e.g., Bobby v. Van Hook, 558\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8).\n32                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhad failed to allege that his counsel\u2019s investigation was\ninadequate under Strickland.\n                             D\n   The majority also concludes that the California Supreme\nCourt could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did\nnot state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of\nthe overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before\nthe jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant\nmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro\nceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. When a\nhabeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, \u201cthe ques\ntion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\nabsent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded\nthat the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum\nstances did not warrant death.\u201d Id., at 695. This inquiry\nrequires evaluating \u201cthe totality of the available mitiga\ntion evidence\u2014both that adduced at trial, and the evi\ndence adduced in the habeas proceeding\u2014in reweighing it\nagainst the evidence in aggravation.\u201d Terry Williams, 529\nU. S., at 397\u2013398. The ultimate question in this case is\nwhether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra\nvating evidence, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal.

By virtue of its\nverdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded\nthat Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the\nmajority states, the jury saw Pinholster \u201crevel\u201d in his\nhistory of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

He threatened to kill the State\u2019s lead\nwitness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in\njail.\n  Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently\nintended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19\u201320; see also\nante, at 27\u201328.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,\nBrashear was not a neutral witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (\u201cA\nmother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.\nClearly not the most unbiased witness in the world\u201d).\nNotwithstanding Brashear\u2019s obvious self-interest, counsel\nfailed to offer readily available, objective evidence that\nwould have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.\nTheir failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her\ntestimony in closing argument. See supra, at 19\u201320. And\nBrashear\u2019s statement that Pinholster would not be alive\nmuch longer because he had \u201ca chip in his head floating\naround,\u201d 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her\ncredibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447\n(\u201cDoes she want you to believe sometime before he got to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear\u2019s testi\n\nmony. Although Brashear testified that the family \u201cdidn\u2019t have lots of\nmoney,\u201d she followed up that comment by stating that Pinholster did\nnot bring friends to the house because \u201cit was too nice a house.\u201d 52 Tr.\n7404.

See supra, at 20.\n   Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster\u2019s state\ncourt petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her\ntestimony in ways that undermined Pinholster\u2019s mitiga\ntion case. As in Sears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the\nprosecutor used Brashear\u2019s testimony that Pinholster\ncame from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.\n   In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating\nevidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their half\nhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate\nfor the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days\nto reach a decision to impose a death sentence.\n                             2\n  The additional mitigating evidence presented to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201cadds up to a mitigation case\nthat bears no relation\u201d to Brashear\u2019s unsubstantiated\ntestimony.

It is for this reason that it was espe\ncially important for counsel to present the available evi\ndence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See Sears,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n   Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the\njudge and jury would have heard credible evidence show\ning that Pinholster\u2019s criminal acts and aggressive tenden\ncies were \u201cattributable to a disadvantaged background, or\nto emotional and mental problems.\u201d Penry, 492 U. S., at\n319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would have\nlearned that Pinholster had the \u201c \u2018kind of troubled history\nwe have declared relevant to assessing a defendant\u2019s\nmoral culpability.\u2019 \u201d Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). Applying Strickland,\nwe have repeatedly found \u201ca reasonable probability,\u201d 466\nU. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have reached a\ndifferent result had counsel presented similar evidence.\nSee, e.g., Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\u201313) (evi\ndence of the defendant\u2019s childhood history of physical\nabuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic\nmilitary service); Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 392 (evidence of\nsevere abuse and neglect as a child, as well as brain\ndamage); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535 (evidence of the de\nfendant\u2019s \u201csevere privation and abuse\u201d as a child, home\nlessness, and \u201cdiminished mental capacities\u201d); Terry\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 398 (evidence of childhood\nmistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic\nmental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).\n   The majority does not dispute the similarity between\nthis case and the cited cases. However, it criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for relying on Rompilla and Terry Wil\nliams on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice ques\ntion de novo in those cases. See ante, at 31. I do not read\nTerry Williams to review the prejudice question de novo.27\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 27 Terry   Williams held that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201cunreason\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

In each of these cases, we did not purport to\ncreate new law; we simply applied the same clearly estab\nlished precedent, Strickland, to a different set of facts.\nBecause these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation\nevidence that suffice to establish prejudice under Strick\nland, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for\ncourts to consider when determining whether a state court\nhas unreasonably applied Strickland.\n   In many cases, a state court presented with additional\nmitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is\nno \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This is not such\na case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and\nkilled two people, and his history of violent outbursts and\nburglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the\nhomicides did not appear premeditated. And the State\u2019s\naggravation case was no stronger than in Rompilla and\nTerry Williams. See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant\ncommitted murder by torture and had a significant history\nof violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (the defendant had a lifetime of crime, and after the\nmurder he \u201csavagely beat an elderly woman,\u201d set a home\non fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Even on the trial record, it took the jury two\ndays to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the \u201cnot\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nable in at least two respects\u201d: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard,\n\nsee 529 U. S., at 397, and (2) it \u201cfailed to accord appropriate weight to \n\nthe body of mitigation evidence available to trial counsel,\u201d id., at 398.\n\nWe did not purport to conduct de novo review. \n\n38                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npersuasive\u201d mitigation case put on by Pinholster\u2019s counsel,\n54 Tr. 7514, and the substantial mitigation evidence at\ntheir fingertips was stark. Given these considerations, it\nis not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that\na juror familiar with his troubled background and psychi\natric issues would have reached the same conclusion\nregarding Pinholster\u2019s culpability. Fairminded jurists\ncould not doubt that, on the record before the California\nSupreme Court, \u201cthere [was] a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537.\n                            III\n  The state-court record on its own was more than ade\nquate to support the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court could not reasonably have\nrejected Pinholster\u2019s Strickland claim. The additional\nevidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only\nconfirms that conclusion.\n                              A\n   At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same\ndocuments that were before the state habeas court. He\nalso offered his trial attorneys\u2019 billing records, which were\nbefore the state habeas court as part of the trial record. Of\nthe seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six\nhad previously executed declarations in support of Pinhol\nster\u2019s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster\u2019s\nuncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)\n   Two experts testified on Pinholster\u2019s behalf; neither had\npresented declarations to the state habeas court. The first\nwas Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology\nand neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric\nEpilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.\nIt appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the\ntestimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the fed\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Calderon, No. CV 95\u20136240\u2013GLT\n(CD Cal.), p. 2. Relying in part on Pinholster\u2019s abnormal\nEEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster\u2019s childhood acci\ndents \u201clikely result[ed] in brain injury\u201d and that these\ninjuries \u201cconferred a risk of epilepsy.\u201d Record ER\u2013699 to\nER\u2013700. He concluded that it was reasonably probable\nthat Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at\nleast 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at\nleast 1964. Id., at ER\u2013701.\n   Pinholster\u2019s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov,\nassociate professor of psychiatry at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco. Dr. Vinogradov\u2019s testimony\nwas based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods\u2019 and\nDr. Stalberg\u2019s state-court declarations. She highlighted\nPinholster\u2019s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy,\nabusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance\nabuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.\nShe opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from\nchildhood head traumas:\n    \u201cAll data indicates that there were severe effects of\n    the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and\n    age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to\n    dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and\n    learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggres\n    sivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, sei\n    zure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013\n    731.\nShe also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinhol\nster was in an \u201capparently hallucinatory state [that] was\nlikely the result of his intoxication with multiple sub\nstances.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013707\n   The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the\n40                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npsychiatrist who had examined Pinholster in the middle of\ntrial,28 and Dr. David Rudnick. Although Dr. Stalberg\nmaintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial per\nsonality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the\nmiddle of trial, he again emphasized that there was \u201cvo\nluminous\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d mitigation evidence that had\nnot previously been made available to him or presented to\nthe jury. Id., at ER\u2013926, ER\u2013953. He stated that conver\nsations with Pinholster\u2019s family revealed that he and his\nsiblings were \u201craised like animals, wild animals,\u201d id., at\nER\u2013948, and he opined that Pinholster\u2019s upbringing was a\nrisk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See ibid.\n(Pinholster\u2019s upbringing \u201cwould speak volumes, looking at\nit from a mitigation point of view\u201d). And he agreed that\nthe mitigation evidence presented at trial was \u201cprofoundly\nmisleading.\u201d Id., at ER\u2013966. Dr. Rudnick testified that\nPinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.\n   The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 proba\ntion report that Pinholster\u2019s counsel had in their posses\nsion at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that\ncounsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for\neducationally handicapped children, that he was commit\nted to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped chil\ndren, and that he suffered two \u201csevere head injuries.\u201d Id.,\nat SER\u2013243.\n                             B\n     Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   28 Before the hearing, Dr. Stalberg had opined that Pinholster was\n\n\u201csubstantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergis\ntically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the crime\nwas committed.\u201d Record ER\u2013587. At a prehearing deposition, however,\nDr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe\nthat Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the\ndeposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, pre\nsumably in light of Dr. Stalberg\u2019s unexpected change in position. The\nState then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    41\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwas duplicative of the evidence submitted to the California\nSupreme Court. The additional evidence presented at the\nhearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court\ncould not reasonably have rejected Pinholster\u2019s claim.29\n   For example, the probation report presented by the\nState confirmed that counsel had in their possession in\nformation that would have led any reasonable attorney \u201cto\ninvestigate further.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Counsel\nnevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.\n   Pinholster\u2019s experts opined that his childhood head\ntraumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a\nrisk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony\nthat Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was\nnot clear error for the District Court to conclude that\njurors could have credited Pinholster\u2019s experts. Even the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 The  State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on\nthe evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not dili\ngent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was there\nfore barred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat\nimprecise. Pinholster\u2019s allegations in his amended federal petition\nwere \u201cidentical\u201d to the allegations he presented to the California\nSupreme Court, ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in\nstate court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster\u2019s\nnew expert testimony changed \u201cthe factual basis\u201d of his claim such that,\nby the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied\n\u00a72254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that\nPinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, \u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural\ndefault. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim\nto the District Court.\n  In any event, Pinholster satisfied \u00a72254(e)(2) in this case. He made\n\u201ca reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time,\nto investigate and pursue claims in state court.\u201d Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I\ncannot read \u00a72254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners\nmust use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule\nwould result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of\nthe unanticipated death of an expert.\n42                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nState\u2019s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the \u201cvolumi\nnous\u201d mitigation evidence in Pinholster\u2019s case. Record ER\u2013\n926.\n  In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap\nparent from the state-court record: Pinholster\u2019s counsel\nfailed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,\nand there was a reasonable probability that at least one\njuror confronted with the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigating evi\ndence counsel should have discovered would have voted to\nspare Pinholster\u2019s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the\nbasis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below\ncorrectly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s decision reflected an unrea\nsonable application of Strickland.30\n                        *     *     *\n  I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court\u2019s ruling. I\nfear the consequences of the Court\u2019s novel interpretation\nof \u00a72254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with\ncompelling evidence supporting their claims who were\nunable, through no fault of their own, to present that\nevidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.\nAnd the Court\u2019s conclusion that the California Supreme\nCourt reasonably denied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel\u2019s failure to\ninvestigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast\nbetween the woefully inadequate mitigation case they\npresented and the evidence they should and would have\ndiscovered. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   30 The State\u2019s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions\n\nwhether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi\ntional evidence in the \u00a72254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster\nsatisfied \u00a72254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not\nchallenged the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had\nproved that he was \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws\nor treaties of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(a).\n</pre>",
