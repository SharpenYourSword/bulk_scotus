WINN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u2013987.      Argued November 3, 2010\u2014Decided April 4, 2011*\nRespondents, Arizona taxpayers, sued petitioner Director of the State\n  Department of Revenue, challenging Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a743\u20131089\n  on Establishment Clause grounds. The Arizona law gives tax credits\n  for contributions to school tuition organizations, or STOs, which then\n  use the contributions to provide scholarships to students attending\n  private schools, including religious schools. Petitioner Arizona Chris\n  tian School Tuition Organization and others later intervened. The\n  District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. Revers\n  ing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents had standing as taxpay\n  ers under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, and had stated an Establish\n  ment Clause claim.\nHeld: Because respondents challenge a tax credit as opposed to a gov\n ernmental expenditure, they lack Article III standing under Flast v.\n Cohen, supra. Pp. 4\u201319.\n    (a) Article III vests in the Federal Judiciary the \u201cPower\u201d to resolve\n \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d That language limits the Federal Judi\n ciary to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts: redressing in\n juries resulting from a specific legal dispute. To obtain a ruling on\n the merits in federal court a plaintiff must assert more than just the\n \u201cgeneralized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance.\u201d\n Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 217.\n Instead the plaintiff must establish standing, which requires \u201can \u2018in\n jury in fact\u2019\u201d; \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 09\u2013991, Garriott, Director, Arizona Department\nof Revenue v.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) In general, the mere fact that someone is a taxpayer does not\n    provide standing to seek relief in federal court. The typical assertion\n    of taxpayer standing rests on unjustifiable economic and political\n    speculation. See Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447; Doremus v.\n    Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429. When a government ex\n    pends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not nec\n    essarily suffer. Even assuming the State\u2019s coffers are depleted, find\n    ing injury would require a court to speculate \u201cthat elected officials\n    will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s tax bill to make up a deficit.\u201d\n    DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 344. And to find re\n    dressability a court must assume that, were the taxpayers\u2019 remedy\n    allowed, \u201clegislators [would] pass along the supposed increased reve\n    nue in the form of tax reductions.\u201d Ibid. These conclusions apply to\n    the present cases. The costs of education may be a significant portion\n    of Arizona\u2019s annual budget, but the tax credit, by facilitating the op\n    eration of both religious and secular private schools, could relieve the\n    burden on public schools and provide cost savings to the State. Even\n    if the tax credit had an adverse effect on Arizona\u2019s budget, problems\n    would remain. To find a particular injury in fact would require\n    speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by in\n    creasing respondents\u2019 tax liability. A causation finding would depend\n    on the additional assumption that any tax increase would be trace\n    able to the STO tax credit. And respondents have not established\n    that an injunction against the credit\u2019s application would prompt Ari\n    zona legislators to \u201cpass along [any] increased revenue [as] tax reduc\n    tions.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (c) Respondents\u2019 suit does not fall within the narrow exception to\n    the rule against taxpayer standing established in Flast v. Cohen, su\n    pra. There, federal taxpayers had standing to mount an Establish\n    ment Clause challenge to a federal statute providing General Treas\n    ury funds to support, inter alia, textbook purchases for religious\n    schools. To have standing under Flast, taxpayers must show (1) a\n    \u201clogical link\u201d between the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer status \u201cand the type of\n    legislative enactment attacked,\u201d and (2) \u201ca nexus\u201d between such tax\n    payer status and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional infringe\n    ment alleged.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102. Considering the two requirements\n    together, Flast explained that individuals suffer a particular injury\n    when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of \u201cthe\n    taxing and spending power,\u201d their property is transferred through\n    the Government\u2019s Treasury to a sectarian entity. Id., at 105\u2013106.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n\u201cThe taxpayer\u2019s allegation in such cases would be that his tax money\nis being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional pro-\ntections against such abuses of legislative power.\u201d Id., at 106. The\nSTO tax credit does not visit the injury identified in Flast. When the\nGovernment spends funds from the General Treasury, dissenting\ntaxpayers know that they have been made to contribute to an estab-\nlishment in violation of conscience. In contrast, a tax credit allows\ndissenting taxpayers to use their own funds in accordance with their\nown consciences. Here, the STO tax credit does not \u201cextrac[t] and\nspen[d]\u201d a conscientious dissenter\u2019s funds in service of an establish-\nment, 392 U. S., at 106, or \u201c \u2018force a citizen to contribute\u2019 \u201d to a sectar-\nian organization, id., at 103. Rather, taxpayers are free to pay their\nown tax bills without contributing to an STO, to contribute to a reli-\ngious or secular STO of their choice, or to contribute to other charita-\nble organizations. Because the STO tax credit is not tantamount to a\nreligious tax, respondents have not alleged an injury for standing\npurposes. Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements\nof causation and redressability. When the government collects and\nspends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the\ntransfer of wealth; the resulting subsidy of religious activity is, under\nFlast, traceable to the government\u2019s expenditures; and an injunction\nagainst those expenditures would address taxpayer-plaintiffs\u2019 objec-\ntions of conscience. Here, by contrast, contributions result from the\ndecisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private\ncitizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and\ntaxpayers then contribute to STOs. Any injury the objectors may suf-\nfer are not fairly traceable to the government. And, while an injunc-\ntion most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy\nwould not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.\nPp. 10\u201316.\n   (d) Respondents\u2019 contrary position\u2014that Arizonans benefiting from\nthe tax credit in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs\u2014\nassumes that all income is government property, even if it has not\ncome into the tax collector\u2019s hands. That premise finds no basis in\nstanding jurisprudence. This Court has sometimes reached the merits\nin Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits as opposed to\ngovernmental expenditures. See Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388;\nCommittee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756;\nHunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734; Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New\nYork, 397 U. S. 664. But those cases did not mention standing and so\ndo not stand for the proposition that no jurisdictional defects existed.\nMoreover, it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio standing\ndeterminations in those cases depended on Flast, as there are other\nways of establishing standing in Establishment Clause cases involving\ntax benefits.

STOs use these contribu\u00ad\ntions to provide scholarships to students attending private\nschools, many of which are religious. Respondents are a\ngroup of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax\ncredit as a violation of Establishment Clause principles\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the\nArizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment\nClause claim on the merits, respondents sought interven\u00ad\ntion from the Federal Judiciary.\n   To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court,\nparties seeking relief must show that they have standing\nunder Article III of the Constitution. Standing in Estab\u00ad\n2   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nlishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways.\nSome plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the\ndirect harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of\nreligion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school\nclassroom. See School Dist. of Abington Township v.\nSchempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224, n. 9 (1963). Other plaintiffs\nmay demonstrate standing on the ground that they have\nincurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their\nreligion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged\ndiscrimination in the tax code, such as when the availabil\u00ad\nity of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affilia\u00ad\ntion. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8\n(1989) (plurality opinion).\n   For their part, respondents contend that they have\nstanding to challenge Arizona\u2019s STO tax credit for one and\nonly one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers. But\nthe mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally\ndeemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court.\nTo overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an excep\u00ad\ntion created in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968). For the\nreasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advan\u00ad\ntage of Flast\u2019s narrow exception to the general rule against\ntaxpayer standing. As a consequence, respondents lacked\nstanding to commence this action, and their suit must be\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n                                I\n   Respondents challenged \u00a743\u20131089, a provision of the\nArizona Tax Code. See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws \u00a743\u20131087,\ncodified, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a743\u20131089\n(West Supp. 2010). Section 43\u20131089 allows Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500\nper person and $1,000 per married couple for contribu\u00ad\ntions to STOs. \u00a743\u20131089(A). If the credit exceeds an\nindividual\u2019s tax liability, the credit\u2019s unused portion can be\ncarried forward up to five years. \u00a743\u20131089(D). Under a\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversion of \u00a743\u20131089 in effect during the pendency of this\nlawsuit, a charitable organization could be deemed an\nSTO only upon certain conditions. See \u00a743\u20131089 (West\n2006). The organization was required to be exempt from\nfederal taxation under \u00a7501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986. \u00a743\u20131089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005). It could\nnot limit its scholarships to students attending only one\nschool. Ibid. And it had to allocate \u201cat least ninety per\ncent of its annual revenue for educational scholarships or\ntuition grants\u201d to children attending qualified schools.\nIbid. A \u201cqualified school,\u201d in turn, was defined in part as a\nprivate school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the\nbasis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or national\norigin. \u00a743\u20131089(G)(2).\n   In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers challenged \u00a743\u20131089, invoking both the United\nStates Constitution and the Arizona Constitution. The\nArizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers\u2019 claims on\nthe merits. Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d\n606 (1999). This Court denied certiorari. Rhodes v.\nKillian, 528 U. S. 810 (1999); Kotterman v. Killian, 528\nU. S. 921 (1999).\n   The present action was filed in the United States Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court for the District of Arizona. It named the Direc\u00ad\ntor of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant.\nThe Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that\n\u00a743\u20131089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment, as incorporated against the States by the\nFourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that \u00a743\u2013\n1089 allows STOs \u201cto use State income-tax revenues to\npay tuition for students at religious schools,\u201d some of\nwhich \u201cdiscriminate on the basis of religion in selecting\nstudents.\u201d Complaint in No. 00\u20130287 (D Ariz.), \u00b6\u00b629\u201331,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09\u2013987, pp. 125a\u2013126a.

The District Court dis\u00ad\nmissed respondents\u2019 suit as jurisdictionally barred by the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341. The Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals reversed. This Court agreed with the Court of\nAppeals and affirmed. Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004).\n  On remand, the Arizona Christian School Tuition Or\u00ad\nganization and other interested parties intervened. The\nDistrict Court once more dismissed respondents\u2019 suit, this\ntime for failure to state a claim. Once again, the Court of\nAppeals reversed. It held that respondents had standing\nunder Flast v. Cohen, supra. 562 F. 3d 1002 (CA9 2009).\nReaching the merits, the Court of Appeals ruled that\nrespondents had stated a claim that \u00a743\u20131089 violated the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment. The full\nCourt of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges\ndissenting. 586 F. 3d 649 (CA9 2009). This Court granted\ncertiorari. 560 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II\n   The concept and operation of the separation of powers\nin our National Government have their principal founda\u00ad\ntion in the first three Articles of the Constitution. Under\nArticle III, the Federal Judiciary is vested with the\n\u201cPower\u201d to resolve not questions and issues but \u201cCases\u201d or\n\u201cControversies.\u201d This language restricts the federal judi\u00ad\ncial power \u201cto the traditional role of the Anglo-American\ncourts.\u201d Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 4). In the English legal tradition,\nthe need to redress an injury resulting from a specific\ndispute taught the efficacy of judicial resolution and gave\nlegitimacy to judicial decrees. The importance of resolving\nspecific cases was visible, for example, in the incremental\napproach of the common law and in equity\u2019s consideration\nof exceptional circumstances. The Framers paid heed to\nthese lessons. See U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe judicial\nPower shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity . . . \u201d).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Reservists Comm. to Stop the\nWar, 418 U. S. 208, 217 (1974).\n   Continued adherence to the case-or-controversy re\u00ad\nquirement of Article III maintains the public\u2019s confidence\nin an unelected but restrained Federal Judiciary. If the\njudicial power were \u201cextended to every question under the\nconstitution,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall once explained,\nfederal courts might take possession of \u201calmost every\nsubject proper for legislative discussion and decision.\u201d 4\nPapers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984) (quoted in\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 341 (2006)).\nThe legislative and executive departments of the Federal\nGovernment, no less than the judicial department, have a\nduty to defend the Constitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI,\ncl. 3. That shared obligation is incompatible with the\nsuggestion that federal courts might wield an \u201cuncondi\u00ad\ntioned authority to determine the constitutionality of\nlegislative or executive acts.\u201d Valley Forge Christian\nCollege v. Americans United for Separation of Church and\nState, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). For the federal\ncourts to decide questions of law arising outside of cases\nand controversies would be inimical to the Constitution\u2019s\ndemocratic character. And the resulting conflict between\nthe judicial and the political branches would not, \u201cin the\nlong run, be beneficial to either.\u201d United States v.\nRichardson, 418 U.

S. 555 (1992).\n     \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in\n     fact\u2019\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which\n     is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or\n     imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Sec\u00ad\n     ond, there must be a causal connection between the\n     injury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury has\n     to be \u2018fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of\n     the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the inde\u00ad\n     pendent action of some third party not before the\n     court.\u2019 Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely\n     \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a fa\u00ad\n     vorable decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 560\u2013561 (citations and foot\u00ad\n     note omitted).\nIn requiring a particular injury, the Court meant \u201cthat the\ninjury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individ\u00ad\nual way.\u201d Id., at 560, n. 1. The question now before the\nCourt is whether respondents, the plaintiffs in the trial\ncourt, satisfy the requisite elements of standing.\n                             A\n  Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers provides them with standing to challenge the STO\ntax credit. Absent special circumstances, however, stand\u00ad\ning cannot be based on a plaintiff\u2019s mere status as a tax\u00ad\npayer. This Court has rejected the general proposition\nthat an individual who has paid taxes has a \u201ccontinuing,\nlegally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds\nare not used by the Government in a way that violates the\nConstitution.\u201d Hein v. Freedom From Religion Founda\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599 (2007) (plurality opinion).\nThis precept has been referred to as the rule against tax\u00ad\npayer standing.\n   The doctrinal basis for the rule was discussed in Froth\ningham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923) (decided with\nMassachusetts v. Mellon). There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had\nalleged that certain federal expenditures were in excess\nof congressional authority under the Constitution. The\nplaintiff argued that she had standing to raise her claim\nbecause she had an interest in the Government Treasury\nand because the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of\nGovernment funds would affect her personal tax liability.\nThe Court rejected those arguments. The \u201ceffect upon\nfuture taxation, of any payment out of funds,\u201d was too\n\u201cremote, fluctuating and uncertain\u201d to give rise to a case\nor controversy. Id., at 487. And the taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s\n\u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury,\u201d the Court recog\u00ad\nnized, was necessarily \u201cshared with millions of others.\u201d\nIbid. As a consequence, Frothingham held that the tax\u00ad\npayer-plaintiff had not presented a \u201cjudicial controversy\u201d\nappropriate for resolution in federal court but rather a\n\u201cmatter of public . . . concern\u201d that could be pursued only\nthrough the political process. Id., at 487\u2013489.\n   In a second pertinent case, Doremus v. Board of Ed. of\nHawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952), the Court considered\nFrothingham\u2019s prohibition on taxpayer standing in con\u00ad\nnection with an alleged Establishment Clause violation. A\nNew Jersey statute had provided that public school teach\u00ad\ners would read Bible verses to their students at the start\nof each schoolday. A plaintiff sought to have the law\nenjoined, asserting standing based on her status as a\ntaxpayer. Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson reiter\u00ad\nated the foundational role that Article III standing plays\nin our separation of powers.\n8   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201c \u2018The party who invokes the power [of the federal\n     courts] must be able to show not only that the statute\n     is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately\n     in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result\n     of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in\n     some indefinite way in common with people gener\u00ad\n     ally.\u2019 \u201d Doremus, supra, at 434 (quoting Frothingham,\n     supra, at 488).\nThe plaintiff in Doremus lacked any \u201cdirect and particular\nfinancial interest\u201d in the suit, and, as a result, a decision\non the merits would have been merely \u201cadvisory.\u201d 342\nU. S., at 434\u2013435. It followed that the plaintiff\u2019s allega\u00ad\ntions did not give rise to a case or controversy subject to\njudicial resolution under Article III. Ibid. Cf. School Dist.\nof Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 224, n. 9\n(finding standing where state laws required Bible readings\nor prayer in public schools, not because plaintiffs were\nstate taxpayers but because their children were enrolled\nin public schools and so were \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by the\nchallenged laws).\n   In holdings consistent with Frothingham and Doremus,\nmore recent decisions have explained that claims of tax\u00ad\npayer standing rest on unjustifiable economic and political\nspeculation. When a government expends resources or\ndeclines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily\nsuffer. On the contrary, the purpose of many governmen\u00ad\ntal expenditures and tax benefits is \u201cto spur economic\nactivity, which in turn increases government revenues.\u201d\nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344.\n   Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expendi\u00ad\nture or tax benefit depletes the government\u2019s coffers. To\nfind injury, a court must speculate \u201cthat elected officials\nwill increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s tax bill to make up a\ndeficit.\u201d Ibid. And to find redressability, a court must\nassume that, were the remedy the taxpayers seek to be\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallowed, \u201clegislators will pass along the supposed in\u00ad\ncreased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\u201d Ibid. It\nwould be \u201cpure speculation\u201d to conclude that an injunction\nagainst a government expenditure or tax benefit \u201cwould\nresult in any actual tax relief\u201d for a taxpayer-plaintiff.\nASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion\nof KENNEDY, J.).\n   These well-established principles apply to the present\ncases. Respondents may be right that Arizona\u2019s STO tax\ncredits have an estimated annual value of over $50 mil\u00ad\nlion. See Brief for Respondent Winn et al. 42; see also\nArizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s\nTax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2010) (reporting the total estimated \u201cvalue\u201d of STO tax\ncredits claimed over a 1-year period). The education of its\nyoung people is, of course, one of the State\u2019s principal\nmissions and responsibilities; and the consequent costs\nwill make up a significant portion of the state budget.\nThat, however, is just the beginning of the analysis.\n   By helping students obtain scholarships to private\nschools, both religious and secular, the STO program\nmight relieve the burden placed on Arizona\u2019s public\nschools. The result could be an immediate and permanent\ncost savings for the State. See Brief for Petitioner Arizona\nChristian School Tuition Organization 31 (discussing\nstudies indicating that the STO program may on net save\nthe State money); see also Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388,\n395 (1983) (\u201cBy educating a substantial number of stu\u00ad\ndents [private] schools relieve public schools of a corre\u00ad\nspondingly great burden\u2014to the benefit of all taxpayers\u201d).\nUnderscoring the potential financial benefits of the STO\nprogram, the average value of an STO scholarship may be\nfar less than the average cost of educating an Arizona\npublic school student. See Brief for Petitioner Garriott 38.\nBecause it encourages scholarships for attendance at\nprivate schools, the STO tax credit may not cause the\n10 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nState to incur any financial loss.\n   Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect\non Arizona\u2019s annual budget, problems would remain. To\nconclude there is a particular injury in fact would require\nspeculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue\nshortfalls by increasing respondents\u2019 tax liability. Daim\nlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. A finding of causation\nwould depend on the additional determination that any\ntax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as\ndistinct from other governmental expenditures or other\ntax benefits. Respondents have not established that an\ninjunction against application of the STO tax credit would\nprompt Arizona legislators to \u201cpass along the supposed\nincreased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\u201d Ibid.\nThose matters, too, are conjectural.\n   Each of the inferential steps to show causation and\nredressability depends on premises as to which there\nremains considerable doubt. The taxpayers have not\nshown that any interest they have in protecting the State\nTreasury would be advanced. Even were they to show\nsome closer link, that interest is still of a general charac\u00ad\nter, not particular to certain persons. Nor have the tax\u00ad\npayers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition\ncredit scheme. The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule\ndesigned both to avoid speculation and to insist on par\u00ad\nticular injury, applies to respondents\u2019 lawsuit. The tax\u00ad\npayers, then, must rely on an exception to the rule, an\nexception next to be considered.\n                              B\n  The primary contention of respondents, of course, is\nthat, despite the general rule that taxpayers lack standing\nto object to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional,\ntheir suit falls within the exception established by Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83. It must be noted at the outset that,\nas this Court has explained, Flast\u2019s holding provides a\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to \u201cthe general rule against taxpayer\nstanding.\u201d Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988).\n   At issue in Flast was the standing of federal taxpayers\nto object, on First Amendment grounds, to a congressional\nstatute that allowed expenditures of federal funds from\nthe General Treasury to support, among other programs,\n\u201cinstruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in\nreligious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other\ninstructional materials for use in such schools.\u201d 392 U. S.,\nat 85\u201386. Flast held that taxpayers have standing when\ntwo conditions are met.\n   The first condition is that there must be a \u201clogical link\u201d\nbetween the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer status \u201cand the type of\nlegislative enactment attacked.\u201d Id., at 102. This condi\u00ad\ntion was not satisfied in Doremus because the statute\nchallenged in that case\u2014providing for the recitation of\nBible passages in public schools\u2014involved at most an\n\u201cincidental expenditure of tax funds.\u201d Flast, 392 U. S., at\n102. In Flast, by contrast, the allegation was that the\nFederal Government violated the Establishment Clause in\nthe exercise of its legislative authority both to collect and\nspend tax dollars. Id., at 103. In the decades since Flast,\nthe Court has been careful to enforce this requirement.\nSee Hein, 551 U. S. 587 (no standing under Flast to chal\u00ad\nlenge federal executive actions funded by general appro\u00ad\npriations); Valley Forge, 454 U. S. 464 (no standing under\nFlast to challenge an agency\u2019s decision to transfer a parcel\nof federal property pursuant to the Property Clause).\n   The second condition for standing under Flast is that\nthere must be \u201ca nexus\u201d between the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer\nstatus and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional in\u00ad\nfringement alleged.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102. This condition was\ndeemed satisfied in Flast based on the allegation that\nGovernment funds had been spent on an outlay for relig\u00ad\nion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. Id., at\n85\u201386. In Frothingham, by contrast, the claim was that\n12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress had exceeded its constitutional authority with\u00ad\nout regard to any specific prohibition. 392 U. S., at 104\u2013\n105. Confirming that Flast turned on the unique features\nof Establishment Clause violations, this Court has \u201cde\u00ad\nclined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging\nviolations of any constitutional provision apart from the\nEstablishment Clause.\u201d Hein, supra, at 609 (plurality\nopinion); see also Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (Statement\nand Account Clause); Schlesinger, 418 U. S. 208 (Incom\u00ad\npatibility Clause).\n   After stating the two conditions for taxpayer standing,\nFlast considered them together, explaining that individu\u00ad\nals suffer a particular injury for standing purposes when,\nin violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of\n\u201cthe taxing and spending power,\u201d their property is trans\u00ad\nferred through the Government\u2019s Treasury to a sectarian\nentity. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. As Flast put it: \u201cThe tax\u00ad\npayer\u2019s allegation in such cases would be that his tax\nmoney is being extracted and spent in violation of specific\nconstitutional protections against such abuses of legisla\u00ad\ntive power.\u201d Id., at 106. Flast thus \u201cunderstood the \u2018in\u00ad\njury\u2019 alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal\nspending to be the very \u2018extract[ion] and spen[ding]\u2019 of \u2018tax\nmoney\u2019 in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.\u201d Daimler-\nChrysler, 547 U. S., at 348 (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at\n106)). \u201cSuch an injury,\u201d Flast continued, is unlike \u201cgener\u00ad\nalized grievances about the conduct of government\u201d and so\nis \u201cappropriate for judicial redress.\u201d Id., at 106.\n   Flast found support for its finding of personal injury in\n\u201cthe history of the Establishment Clause,\u201d particularly\nJames Madison\u2019s Memorial and Remonstrance Against\nReligious Assessments. DaimlerChrysler, supra, at 348.\nIn 1785, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\nVirginia considered a \u201ctax levy to support teachers of the\nChristian religion.\u201d Flast, supra, at 104, n. 24; see A Bill\nEstablishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReligion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,\n330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of\nRutledge, J.). Under the proposed assessment bill, tax\u00ad\npayers would direct their payments to Christian societies\nof their choosing. Ibid. If a taxpayer made no such choice,\nthe General Assembly was to divert his funds to \u201cseminar\u00ad\nies of learning,\u201d at least some of which \u201cundoubtedly would\nhave been religious in character.\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 869, n. 1 (1995)\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also id., at 853, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring). How\u00ad\never the \u201cseminaries\u201d provision might have functioned in\npractice, critics took the position that the proposed bill\nthreatened compulsory religious contributions. See, e.g.,\nT. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia,\n1776\u20131787, pp. 133\u2013134 (1977); H. Eckenrode, Separation\nof Church and State in Virginia 106\u2013108 (1910).\n   In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to\nthe proposed assessment on the ground that it would\ncoerce a form of religious devotion in violation of con\u00ad\nscience. In Madison\u2019s view, government should not \u201c \u2018force\na citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for\nthe support of any one establishment.\u2019 \u201d Flast, supra, at\n103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G.\nHunt ed. 1901)). This Madisonian prohibition does not\ndepend on the amount of property conscripted for sectar\u00ad\nian ends. Any such taking, even one amounting to \u201cthree\npence only,\u201d violates conscience. 392 U. S., at 103; cf.\nsupra, at 6\u20137. The proposed bill ultimately died in com\u00ad\nmittee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legisla\u00ad\ntion forbidding \u201ccompelled\u201d support of religion. See A Bill\nfor Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers\nof Thomas Jefferson 545\u2013546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also\nFlast, 392 U. S., at 104, n. 24. Madison himself went on to\nbecome, as Flast put it, \u201cthe leading architect of the relig\u00ad\nion clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 103. Flast\n14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nwas thus informed by \u201cthe specific evils\u201d identified in the\npublic arguments of \u201cthose who drafted the Establishment\nClause and fought for its adoption.\u201d Id., at 103\u2013104; see\nalso Feldman, Intellectual Origins of the Establishment\nClause, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 346, 351 (2002) (\u201c[T]he Fram\u00ad\ners\u2019 generation worried that conscience would be violated\nif citizens were required to pay taxes to support religious\ninstitutions with whose beliefs they disagreed\u201d); McCon\u00ad\nnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment, 27\nWm. & Mary L. Rev. 933, 936\u2013939 (1986).\n   Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate\ntheir standing to challenge the STO tax credit. In their\nview the tax credit is, for Flast purposes, best understood\nas a governmental expenditure. That is incorrect.\n   It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental ex\u00ad\npenditures can have similar economic consequences, at\nleast for beneficiaries whose tax liability is sufficiently\nlarge to take full advantage of the credit. Yet tax credits\nand governmental expenditures do not both implicate\nindividual taxpayers in sectarian activities. A dissenter\nwhose tax dollars are \u201cextracted and spent\u201d knows that he\nhas in some small measure been made to contribute to an\nestablishment in violation of conscience. Flast, supra, at\n106. In that instance the taxpayer\u2019s direct and particular\nconnection with the establishment does not depend on\neconomic speculation or political conjecture. The connec\u00ad\ntion would exist even if the conscientious dissenter\u2019s tax\nliability were unaffected or reduced. See DaimlerChrysler,\nsupra, at 348\u2013349. When the government declines to\nimpose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection\nbetween dissenting taxpayer and alleged establishment.\nAny financial injury remains speculative. See supra, at 6\u2013\n10. And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other\ncitizens to retain control over their own funds in accor\u00ad\ndance with their own consciences.\n   The distinction between governmental expenditures and\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntax credits refutes respondents\u2019 assertion of standing.\nWhen Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs,\nthey spend their own money, not money the State has\ncollected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Ari\u00ad\nzona\u2019s \u00a743\u20131089 does not \u201cextrac[t] and spen[d]\u201d a consci\u00ad\nentious dissenter\u2019s funds in service of an establishment,\nFlast, 392 U. S., at 106, or \u201c \u2018force a citizen to contribute\nthree pence only of his property\u2019 \u201d to a sectarian organiza\u00ad\ntion, id., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison,\nsupra, at 186). On the contrary, respondents and other\nArizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills,\nwithout contributing to an STO. Respondents are likewise\nable to contribute to an STO of their choice, either reli\u00ad\ngious or secular. And respondents also have the option of\ncontributing to other charitable organizations, in which\ncase respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction\nor a different tax credit. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a743\u20131088 (West Supp. 2010). The STO tax credit is not\ntantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not\nvisit the injury identified in Flast. It follows that respon\u00ad\ndents have neither alleged an injury for standing purposes\nunder general rules nor met the Flast exception. Finding\nstanding under these circumstances would be more than\nthe extension of Flast \u201cto the limits of its logic.\u201d Hein, 551\nU. S., at 615 (plurality opinion). It would be a departure\nfrom Flast\u2019s stated rationale.\n   Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the require\u00ad\nments of causation and redressability. When the govern\u00ad\nment collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental\nchoices are responsible for the transfer of wealth. In that\ncase a resulting subsidy of religious activity is, for pur\u00ad\nposes of Flast, traceable to the government\u2019s expenditures.\nAnd an injunction against those expenditures would ad\u00ad\ndress the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer\u00ad\nplaintiffs. See DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. Here,\nby contrast, contributions result from the decisions of\n16 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private\ncitizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary\nschools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs. While the\nState, at the outset, affords the opportunity to create and\ncontribute to an STO, the tax credit system is imple\u00ad\nmented by private action and with no state intervention.\nObjecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not\nthe State, decide to contribute and in fact make the con\u00ad\ntribution. These considerations prevent any injury the\nobjectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the\ngovernment. And while an injunction against application\nof the tax credit most likely would reduce contributions to\nSTOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing tax\u00ad\npayers or their tax payments. As a result, any injury\nsuffered by respondents would not be remedied by an\ninjunction limiting the tax credit\u2019s operation.\n   Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that\nArizonans who benefit from \u00a743\u20131089 tax credits in effect\nare paying their state income tax to STOs. In respon\u00ad\ndents\u2019 view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax\ndeductions do not, since only the former yield a dollar-for\u00ad\ndollar reduction in final tax liability. See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent Winn et al. 5\u20136; Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\u201336. But\nwhat matters under Flast is whether sectarian STOs\nreceive government funds drawn from general tax reve\u00ad\nnues, so that moneys have been extracted from a citizen\nand handed to a religious institution in violation of the\ncitizen\u2019s conscience. Under that inquiry, respondents\u2019\nargument fails. Like contributions that lead to charitable\ntax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits are\nnot owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from tax\u00ad\npayers to private organizations. Respondents\u2019 contrary\nposition assumes that income should be treated as if it\nwere government property even if it has not come into the\ntax collector\u2019s hands. That premise finds no basis in\nstanding jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot be\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

See Mueller, 463 U. S. 388; Committee for\nPublic Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756\n(1973); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973); Walz v. Tax\nComm\u2019n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970); cf.\nHibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (reaching only threshold\njurisdictional issues). But those cases do not mention\nstanding and so are not contrary to the conclusion reached\nhere. When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither\nnoted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does\nnot stand for the proposition that no defect existed. See,\ne.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974)\n(\u201c[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in\nprior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never consid-\nered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings\nthe jurisdictional issue before us\u201d); United States v.

The\nCourt would risk error if it relied on assumptions that\nhave gone unstated and unexamined.\n   Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit,\ndisadvantages a particular religious group or a particular\nnonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not\nhave to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting\ninjury. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 8\n(plurality opinion) (finding standing where a general\ninterest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the\nground that religious periodicals were exempt from the\ntax). Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can\nbe shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any\n18 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nnonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases respondents\ncite would have depended on Flast. See, e.g., Walz, supra,\nat 666\u2013667 (explaining that the plaintiff was an \u201cowner of\nreal estate\u201d in New York City who objected to the city\u2019s\nissuance of \u201cproperty tax exemptions to religious organiza\u00ad\ntions\u201d). That the plaintiffs in those cases could have\nadvanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast\nmakes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether\nor why standing should have been found where the issue\nwas left unexplored.\n   If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real\ninjury to particular individuals, the federal courts may\nadjudicate the matter. Like other constitutional provi\u00ad\nsions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and\nmeaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the\ncontext of actual disputes. That reality underlies the case\u00ad\nor-controversy requirement, a requirement that has not\nbeen satisfied here.\n                         *    *     *\n   Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to\nundermine public confidence in the neutrality and integ\u00ad\nrity of the Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the\nrole of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power\nto invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees\nwith them. In an era of frequent litigation, class actions,\nsweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continu\u00ad\ning jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must\nbe more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing,\nnot less so. Making the Article III standing inquiry all the\nmore necessary are the significant implications of consti\u00ad\ntutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide appli\u00ad\ncability that are beyond Congress\u2019 power to change.\n   The present suit serves as an illustration of these prin\u00ad\nciples.

The Arizona tax\npayers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs)\nallege that the use of these funds to subsidize school tui\ntion organizations (STOs) breaches the Establishment\nClause\u2019s promise of religious neutrality. Many of these\nSTOs, the Plaintiffs claim, discriminate on the basis of a\nchild\u2019s religion when awarding scholarships.\n   For almost half a century, litigants like the Plaintiffs\nhave obtained judicial review of claims that the govern\nment has used its taxing and spending power in violation\nof the Establishment Clause. Beginning in Flast v. Cohen,\n392 U. S. 83 (1968), and continuing in case after case for\n2   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nover four decades, this Court and others have exercised\njurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not\nmaterially different from this one. Not every suit has\nsucceeded on the merits, or should have. But every tax\npayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the\ngovernment\u2019s financing of religious activity.\n   Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing\nto hear taxpayers\u2019 claims that the government has uncon\nstitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system.\nThese litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because\nthe funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax\ncredit, rather than an appropriation. A tax credit, the\nCourt asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because\nit \u201cdoes not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an\nestablishment.\u201d Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted).\n   This novel distinction in standing law between appro\npriations and tax expenditures has as little basis in prin\nciple as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted\ntax breaks are means of accomplishing the same govern\nment objective\u2014to provide financial support to select\nindividuals or organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state\naid of religion have equal reason to protest whether that\naid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either\nway, the government has financed the religious activity.\nAnd so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge\nthe subsidy.\n   Still worse, the Court\u2019s arbitrary distinction threatens to\neliminate all occasions for a taxpayer to contest the gov\nernment\u2019s monetary support of religion. Precisely because\nappropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objec\ntives, the government can easily substitute one for the\nother. Today\u2019s opinion thus enables the government to\nend-run Flast\u2019s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From\nnow on, the government need follow just one simple rule\u2014\nsubsidize through the tax system\u2014to preclude taxpayer\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchallenges to state funding of religion.\n  And that result\u2014the effective demise of taxpayer stand\ning\u2014will diminish the Establishment Clause\u2019s force and\nmeaning. Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has\nsuffered the injury necessary to challenge government\nsponsorship of religion. Today\u2019s holding therefore will\nprevent federal courts from determining whether some\nsubsidies to sectarian organizations comport with our\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality. Because I\nbelieve these challenges warrant consideration on the\nmerits, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.\n                             I\n  As the majority recounts, this Court has held that pay\ning taxes usually does not give an individual Article III\nstanding to challenge government action. Ante, at 6\u201310.\nTaxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury be\ncause each person\u2019s \u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treas\nury . . . is comparatively minute and indeterminable.\u201d\nFrothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923) (decided\nwith Massachusetts v. Mellon). Given the size and com\nplexity of government budgets, it is a \u201cfiction\u201d to contend\nthat an unlawful expenditure causes an individual \u201cany\nmeasurable economic harm.\u201d Hein v. Freedom From\nReligion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 593 (2007) (plu\nrality opinion). Nor can taxpayers in the ordinary case\nestablish causation (i.e., that the disputed government\nmeasure affects their tax burden) or redressability (i.e.,\nthat a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions).\nAnte, at 8\u20139. On these points, all agree.\n  The disagreement concerns their relevance here. This\ncase is not about the general prohibition on taxpayer\nstanding, and cannot be resolved on that basis. This case\nis instead about the exception to the rule\u2014the principle\nestablished decades ago in Flast that taxpayers may chal\nlenge certain government actions alleged to violate the\n4   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nEstablishment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if\ntheir suit meets Flast\u2019s requirements\u2014and it does so\nunder any fair reading of that decision.\n   Taxpayers have standing, Flast held, when they allege\nthat a statute enacted pursuant to the legislature\u2019s taxing\nand spending power violates the Establishment Clause.\n392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. In this situation, the Court ex\nplained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus \u201cbe\ntween the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought\nto be adjudicated.\u201d Id., at 102. First, by challenging\nlegislative action taken under the taxing and spending\nclause, the taxpayer shows \u201ca logical link between [her]\nstatus and the type of . . . enactment attacked.\u201d Ibid.\nSecond, by invoking the Establishment Clause\u2014a specific\nlimitation on the legislature\u2019s taxing and spending\npower\u2014the taxpayer demonstrates \u201ca nexus between [her]\nstatus and the precise nature of the constitutional in\nfringement alleged.\u201d Ibid. Because of these connections,\nFlast held, taxpayers alleging that the government is\nusing tax proceeds to aid religion have \u201cthe necessary\nstake . . . in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article\nIII.\u201d Ibid. They are \u201cproper and appropriate part[ies]\u201d\u2014\nindeed, often the only possible parties\u2014to seek judicial\nenforcement of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious\nneutrality. Ibid.\n   That simple restatement of the Flast standard should be\nenough to establish that the Plaintiffs have standing.\nThey attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the\nlegislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution\u2019s\ntaxing and spending clause (Flast nexus, part 1). And\nthey allege that this provision violates the Establishment\nClause (Flast nexus, part 2). By satisfying both of Flast\u2019s\nconditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their \u201cstake\nas taxpayers\u201d in enforcing constitutional restraints on the\nprovision of aid to STOs. Ibid.

Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 119 (2004)\n(Winn I) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\nFinding standing here is merely a matter of applying\nFlast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndetermination (not questioned even by the eight judges\nwho called for rehearing en banc on the merits) that the\nPlaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.\n                             II\n  The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguish\ning between two methods of financing religion: A taxpayer\nhas standing to challenge state subsidies to religion, the\nCourt announces, when the mechanism used is an appro\npriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax\nbreak, otherwise called a \u201ctax expenditure.\u201d1 In the for\nmer case, but not in the latter, the Court declares, the\ntaxpayer suffers cognizable injury.

In the decades since Flast, no\ncourt\u2014not one\u2014has differentiated between appropriations\nand tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have\nstanding. Over and over again, courts (including this one)\nhave faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits,\ndeductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these\ncourts have reached the merits of these claims. And that\nis for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same\ninjury for standing purposes whether government subsidi\nzation of religion takes the form of a cash grant or a tax\nmeasure. The only rationale the majority offers for its\nnewfound distinction\u2014that grants, but not tax expendi\ntures, somehow come from a complaining taxpayer\u2019s own\nwallet\u2014cannot bear the weight the Court places on it. If\nFlast is still good law\u2014and the majority today says noth\ning to the contrary\u2014then the Plaintiffs should be able to\npursue their claim on the merits.\n                              A\n   Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that\nlitigants in the same shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing\nunder Flast. To the contrary: We have faced the identical\nsituation five times\u2014including in a prior incarnation of\nthis very case!\u2014and we have five times resolved the suit\nwithout questioning the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. Lower fed\neral courts have followed our example and handled the\nmatter in the same way. I count 14 separate cases (involv\ning 20 appellate and district courts) that adjudicated\ntaxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to violate\nthe Establishment Clause.2 I suspect I have missed a few.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See Johnson v.

S. C.\n\u00a71341, posed no barrier to the Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation of their\nEstablishment Clause claim. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at\n112.3 The Court in all five of these cases divided sharply\non the merits of the disputes. But in one respect, the\nJustices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to\nquestion the litigants\u2019 standing.\n  The Solicitor General, participating here as amicus\ncuriae, conceded at oral argument that under the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s\u2014and now the Court\u2019s\u2014view of taxpayer\nstanding, each of these five cases should have been dis\nmissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n      \u201c[The Court:] So if you are right, . . . the Court was\n      without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt,\n      Mueller, [and] Hibbs [v. Winn,] this very case, just a\n      few years ago? . . . .\n      [Solicitor General:] Right. . . . [M]y answer to you is\n      yes.\n      [The Court:] I just want to make sure I heard your\n      answer to the\u2014you said the answer is yes.

This and every federal court has an\nindependent obligation to consider standing, even when\nthe parties do not call it into question. See, e.g., FW/PBS,\nInc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 230\u2013231 (1990). To do any\nthing else would risk an unlawful exercise of judicial\nauthority. And in these cases the Court had an additional\nprompt: In several of them, amici, including the United\nStates, contested\u2014or at least raised as a question\u2014the\nplaintiffs\u2019 standing as taxpayers to pursue their claims.5\nThe Court, moreover, was well aware at the time of the\nissues presented by taxpayer standing.

Richardson, 418\nU. S. 166 (1974); Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop\nthe War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), and the fourth just after we\nheld that bar applicable to a different kind of Establish\nment Clause claim, see Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State,\nInc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982). Indeed, the decisions on their\nface reflect the Court\u2019s recognition of what gave the plain\ntiffs standing; in each, we specifically described the plain\ntiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the tax system\nto fund religious activities. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 94;\nMueller, 463 U. S., at 392; Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 759, 762;\nHunt, 413 U. S., at 735\u2013736; Walz, 397 U. S., at 666\u2013667.\nIn short, we considered and decided all these cases be\ncause we thought taxpayer standing existed.\n   The majority shrugs off these decisions because they did\nnot discuss what was taken as obvious. Ante, at 17. But\nwe have previously stressed that the Court should not\n\u201cdisregard the implications of an exercise of judicial au\nthority assumed to be proper for over 40 years.\u201d Brown\nShoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see\nBowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619 (1988) (finding\nstanding partly because the Court, in deciding similar\ncases, had \u201cnot questioned the standing of taxpayer plain\ntiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges\u201d); Bank of\nUnited States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809) (Mar\nshall, C. J.) (prior decisions exercising but not discussing\njurisdiction \u201chave much weight, as they show that [a\njurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the bar or the\nbench\u201d). And that principle has extra force here, because\nwe have relied on some of these decisions to support the\nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction in other cases. Pause on that for a\nmoment: The very decisions the majority today so easily\ndismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of\njurisdiction. So in School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,\n473 U. S. 373 (1985), we relied on Nyquist and Hunt to\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nconclude that taxpayers had standing to challenge a pro\ngram of aid to religious and other private schools. 473\nU. S., at 380, n. 5, overruled in part on other grounds by\nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997). And in Winn I\n(recall, an earlier iteration of this case), we rejected a\ndifferent jurisdictional objection in part by relying on\nMueller and Nyquist. We called those cases \u201cadjudications\nof great moment discerning no [jurisdictional] barrier\u201d and\nwarned that they could not \u201cbe written off as reflecting\nnothing more than unexamined custom or unthinking\nhabit.\u201d 542 U. S., at 112, n. 13 (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). Until today, that is\u2014when the\nmajority does write off these adjudications and reaches a\nresult against all precedent.\n                              B\n   Our taxpayer standing cases have declined to distin\nguish between appropriations and tax expenditures for a\nsimple reason: Here, as in many contexts, the distinction\nis one in search of a difference. To begin to see why, con\nsider an example far afield from Flast and, indeed, from\nreligion. Imagine that the Federal Government decides it\nshould pay hundreds of billions of dollars to insolvent\nbanks in the midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that\nmany millions of taxpayers oppose this bailout on the\nground (whether right or wrong is immaterial) that it uses\ntheir hard-earned money to reward irresponsible business\nbehavior. In the face of this hostility, some Members of\nCongress make the following proposal: Rather than give\nthe money to banks via appropriations, the Government\nwill allow banks to subtract the exact same amount from\nthe tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U. S.\nTreasury. Would this proposal calm the furor? Or would\nmost taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a\nsubsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished\nby the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; in\n12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndeed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they\nfailed to see through this cynical proposal.\n  And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court\u2019s\ncase law also recognizes\u2014that targeted tax breaks are\noften \u201ceconomically and functionally indistinguishable\nfrom a direct monetary subsidy.\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 859 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). Tax credits, deductions, and\nexemptions provided to an individual or organization have\n\u201cmuch the same effect as a cash grant to the [recipient] of\nthe amount of tax it would have to pay\u201d absent the tax\nbreak. Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash.,\n461 U. S. 540, 544 (1983). \u201cOur opinions,\u201d therefore, \u201chave\nlong recognized . . . the reality that [tax expenditures] are\na form of subsidy that is administered through the tax\nsystem.\u201d Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481\nU. S. 221, 236 (1987) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Or again: Tax breaks \u201ccan be\nviewed as a form of government spending,\u201d Camps New\nfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564,\n589\u2013590, n. 22 (1997), even assuming the diverted tax\nfunds do not pass through the public treasury. And once\nmore: Both special tax benefits and cash grants \u201crepre\nsen[t] a charge made upon the state,\u201d Nyquist, 413 U. S.,\nat 790\u2013791 (internal quotation marks omitted); both de\nplete funds in the government\u2019s coffers by transferring\nmoney to select recipients.6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The majority observes that special tax benefits may in fact \u201cin\n\ncreas[e] government revenues\u201d by \u201cspur[ring] economic activity.\u201d Ante,\nat 8 (internal quotation marks omitted). That may be so in the long\nrun (although the only non-speculative effect is to immediately dimin\nish funds in the public treasury). But as the majority acknowledges,\nibid., this possibility holds just as true for appropriations; that is why\nwe (optimistically) refer to some government outlays as \u201cinvestments.\u201d\nThe insight therefore cannot help the majority distinguish between tax\nexpenditures and appropriations.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n  For just this reason, government budgeting rules rou\ntinely insist on calculation of tax subsidies, in addition to\nappropriations. The President must provide information\non the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget\nhe submits to Congress each year. See 31 U. S. C.\n\u00a71105(a)(16); n. 1, supra. Similarly, congressional budget\ncommittees must report to all Members on the level of\ntax expenditures in the federal budget. See 2 U. S. C.\n\u00a7632(e)(2)(E). Many States\u2014including Arizona\u2014likewise\ncompute the impact of targeted tax breaks on the public\ntreasury, in recognition that these measures are just\nspending under a different name, see n. 1, supra. The\nArizona Department of Revenue must issue an annual\nreport \u201cdetailing the approximate costs in lost revenue for\nall state tax expenditures.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a742\u2013\n1005(A)(4) (West 2006). The most recent report notes the\nsignificance of this accounting in the budget process. It\nexplains that \u201cthe fiscal impact of implementing\u201d targeted\ntax breaks, including the STO credit challenged here, is\n\u201csimilar to a direct expenditure of state funds.\u201d Arizona\nDept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s Tax Ex\npenditures FY 2009/10, p. 1 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010);\nsee also Surrey, Tax Incentives as a Device for Implement\ning Government Policy: A Comparison with Direct Gov\nernment Expenditures, 83 Harv.

Rev. 705, 717 (1970)\n(\u201cA dollar is a dollar\u2014both for the person who receives it\nand the government that pays it, whether the dollar comes\nwith a tax credit label or a direct expenditure label\u201d).\n  And because these financing mechanisms result in the\nsame bottom line, taxpayers challenging them can allege\nthe same harm. Our prior cases have often recognized the\ncost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers gener\nally. \u201cWhen the Government grants exemptions or allows\ndeductions\u201d to some, we have observed, \u201call taxpayers are\naffected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction . . .\nmeans that other taxpayers can be said to be indirect and\n14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nvicarious \u2018donors.\u2019 \u201d Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461\nU. S. 574, 591 (1983). And again: \u201cEvery tax exemption\nconstitutes a subsidy that affects nonqualifying taxpayers,\nforcing them to\u201d bear its cost. Texas Monthly, Inc. v.\nBullock, 489 U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (plurality opinion). Indeed,\nwe have specifically compared the harm arising from a tax\nsubsidy with that arising from a cash grant, and declared\nthose injuries equivalent because both kinds of support\ndeplete the public fisc. \u201cIn either case,\u201d we stated, \u201cthe\nalleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the alleg\nedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the tax\npayer contributes.\u201d DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547\nU. S. 332, 344 (2006). This taxpayer injury of course fails\nto establish standing in the mine-run case, whatever form\nthe state aid takes. See, e.g., id., at 343\u2013344; ante, at 6\u2013\n10; supra, at 3. But the key is this: Whenever taxpayers\nhave standing under Flast to challenge an appropriation,\nthey should also have standing to contest a tax expendi\nture. Their access to the federal courts should not depend\non which type of financial subsidy the State has offered.\n   Consider some further examples of the point, but this\ntime concerning state funding of religion. Suppose a State\ndesires to reward Jews\u2014by, say, $500 per year\u2014for their\nreligious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers\u2019 con\ncern vary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their\ntax returns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend? Or\nassume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of cruci\nfixes. It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and\ndistribute them to all takers. Or it could mail a reim\nbursement check to any individual who buys her own and\nsubmits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize\nthat person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she\npaid. Now, really\u2014do taxpayers have less reason to com\nplain if the State selects the last of these three options?\nThe Court today says they do, but that is wrong. The\neffect of each form of subsidy is the same, on the public\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  15\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfisc and on those who contribute to it. Regardless of which\nmechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an identical\nstake in ensuring that the State\u2019s exercise of its taxing\nand spending power complies with the Constitution.7\n   Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar\nfor-dollar tax credit to aid school tuition organizations.\nEach year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans: Either\npay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or\nsubtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that\nsum to an STO. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 95. To claim the\ncredit, an individual makes a notation on her tax return\nand splits her tax payment into two checks, one made out\nto the State and the other to the STO. As this Court\nrecognized in Winn I, the STO payment is therefore \u201ccost\nless\u201d to the individual, ibid.; it comes out of what she\notherwise would be legally obligated to pay the State\u2014\nhence, out of public resources. And STOs capitalize on\nthis aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth\u2014which is\nquite a lot. To drum up support, STOs highlight that\n\u201cdonations\u201d are made not with an individual\u2019s own, but\nwith other people\u2019s\u2014i.e., taxpayers\u2019\u2014money. One STO\nadvertises that \u201c[w]ith Arizona\u2019s scholarship tax credit,\nyou can send children to our community\u2019s [religious] day\nschools and it won\u2019t cost you a dime!\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 13 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omit\nted). Another urges potential donors to \u201cimagine giving [to\ncharity] with someone else\u2019s money. . . . Stop Imagining,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The majority indicates that some persons could challenge these\n\nhypothetical government actions based on individualized injury, sepa\nrate and apart from taxpayer status. See ante, at 1\u20132, 17\u201318. That is\nquite right; indeed, some parents or children likely have standing to\nchallenge the Arizona tax credit on such grounds. But this possibility\ndoes not detract from the point made here. The purpose of these\nillustrations is to show that if taxpayer status is the thing alleged to\nconfer standing, it should do so irrespective of the form of the govern\nment subsidy.\n16 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthanks to Arizona tax laws you can!\u201d Id., at 14 (internal\nquotation marks and emphasis omitted). And so Arizo\nnans do just that: It is, after all, good fun to spend other\npeople\u2019s money. By the State\u2019s reckoning, from 1998 to\n2008 the credit cost Arizona almost $350 million in redi\nrected tax revenue.8\n  The Plaintiffs contend that this expenditure violates the\nEstablishment Clause. If the legislature had appropriated\nthese monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would have standing,\nbeyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in\nfederal court. But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse,\nthe Court today holds, because Arizona funds STOs\nthrough a tax credit rather than a cash grant. No less\nthan in the hypothetical examples offered above, here too\nform prevails over substance, and differences that make\nno difference determine access to the Judiciary. And the\ncasualty is a historic and vital method of enforcing the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality.\n                              C\n   The majority offers just one reason to distinguish ap\npropriations and tax expenditures: A taxpayer experiences\ninjury, the Court asserts, only when the government\n\u201cextracts and spends\u201d her very own tax dollars to aid\nreligion.

And no taxpayer can make this\nshowing, the Court concludes, if the government subsi\ndizes religion through tax credits, deductions, or exemp\ntions (rather than through appropriations).9\n   The majority purports to rely on Flast to support this\nnew \u201cextraction\u201d requirement.

Arizona\u2019s tuition\ntax-credit program in fact necessitates the direct expenditure of funds\nfrom the state treasury. After all, the statute establishing the initiative\nrequires the Arizona Department of Revenue to certify STOs, maintain\nan STO registry, make the registry available to the public on request\nand post it on a website, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send\nwritten notice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory re\nquirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a743\u20131502(A)\u2013(C), 43\u20131506 (West\nSupp. 2010). Presumably all these activities cost money, which comes\nfrom the state treasury. Thus, on the majority\u2019s own theory, the\ngovernment has \u201cextract[ed] and spen[t]\u201d the Plaintiffs\u2019 (along with\nother taxpayers\u2019) dollars to implement the challenged program, and the\nPlaintiffs should have standing. (The majority, after all, makes clear\nthat nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or proportion of the\nPlaintiffs\u2019 contribution. Ante, at 13.) But applying the majority\u2019s\ntheory in this way reveals the hollowness at its core. Can anyone\nbelieve that the Plaintiffs have suffered injury through the costs\ninvolved in administering the program, but not through the far greater\ncosts of granting the tax expenditure in the first place?\n18 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthe support of any one establishment, may force him to\nconform to any other establishment in all cases whatso\never.\u2019 \u201d 392 U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James\nMadison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)); see ante, at 12\u201314.\nAnd that is all the majority can come up with.\n   But as indicated earlier, everything of import in Flast\ncuts against the majority\u2019s position. Here is how Flast\nstated its holding: \u201c[W]e hold that a taxpayer will have\nstanding consistent with Article III to invoke federal\njudicial power when he alleges that congressional action\nunder the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\u201d\nthe Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. Noth\ning in that straightforward sentence supports the idea\nthat a taxpayer can challenge only legislative action that\ndisburses his particular contribution to the state treasury.\nAnd here is how Flast primarily justified its holding:\n\u201c[O]ne of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the\nEstablishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that\nthe taxing and spending power would be used to favor one\nreligion over another or to support religion in general.\u201d\nId., at 103. That evil arises even if the specific dollars that\nthe government uses do not come from citizens who object\nto the preference. Likewise, the two-part nexus test,\nwhich is the heart of Flast\u2019s doctrinal analysis, contains no\nhint of an extraction requirement. See supra, at 4. And\nfinally, James Madison provides no comfort to today\u2019s\nmajority. He referred to \u201cthree pence\u201d exactly because it\nwas, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as\ntoday, the core injury of a religious establishment had\nnaught to do with any given individual\u2019s out-of-pocket loss.\nSee infra, at 21\u201323 (further discussing Madison\u2019s views).\nSo the majority is left with nothing, save for three words\nFlast used to describe the particular facts in that case: In\nnot a single non-trivial respect could the Flast Court\nrecognize its handiwork in the majority\u2019s depiction.\n   The injury to taxpayers that Flast perceived arose\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      19\n\n                           KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwhenever the legislature used its taxing-and-spending\npower to channel tax dollars to religious activities. In that\nand subsequent cases (including the five in this Court\ninvolving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requi\nsite harm by stating that public resources were funding\nreligion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the\nSolicitor General\u2019s \u201celectronic tag\u201d or other means) did not\nenter into the question. See DaimlerChrysler Corp., 547\nU. S., at 348 (describing how the Flast Court\u2019s under\nstanding of the Establishment Clause\u2019s history led the\nCourt to view the alleged \u201cinjury\u201d as the expenditure of\n\u201c \u2018tax money\u2019 in aid of religion\u201d (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at\n106)). And for all the reasons already given, that standard\nis met regardless whether the funding is provided via cash\ngrant or tax expenditure. See supra, at 11\u201316. Taxpayers\npick up the cost of the subsidy in either form. See ibid. So\ntaxpayers have an interest in preventing the use of either\nmechanism to infringe religious neutrality.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 On  this traditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state\nfinancing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only Article III\u2019s\ninjury requirement, but also its causation and redressability require\nments. The majority\u2019s contrary position, ante, at 15\u201316, stems from its\nmiscasting of the injury involved; once that harm is stated correctly, all\nthe rest follows. To wit: The Plaintiffs allege they suffer injury when\nthe State funnels public resources to religious organizations through\nthe tax credit. Arizona, they claim, has caused this injury by enacting\nlegislation that establishes the credit. And an injunction limiting the\ncredit\u2019s operation would redress the harm by preventing the allegedly\nunlawful diversion of tax revenues. The Plaintiffs need not, as the\nmajority insists, show that this remedy would \u201caffect . . . their tax\npayments,\u201d ante, at 16, any more than the taxpayer in Flast had to\nestablish that her tax burden would decrease absent the Government\u2019s\nfunding of religious schools. As we have previously recognized, when\ntaxpayers object to the spending of tax money in violation of the Estab\nlishment Clause (whether through tax credits or appropriations), \u201can\ninjunction against the spending would . . . redress [their] injury, regard\nless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that\nwould benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\u201d DaimlerChrysler\nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 348\u2013349 (2006).\n20 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Indeed, the majority\u2019s new conception of injury is at\nodds not merely with Flast, but also (if ironically) with our\ncases precluding taxpayer standing generally. See supra,\nat 3; ante, at 6\u201310. Today\u2019s majority insists that legisla\ntion challenged under the Establishment Clause must\n\u201cextrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious dissenter\u2019s funds.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But we have rejected taxpayer standing in\nother contexts because each taxpayer\u2019s share of treasury\nfunds is \u201cminute and indeterminable.\u201d Frothingham, 262\nU. S., at 487. No taxpayer can point to an expenditure (by\ncash grant or otherwise) and say that her own tax dollars\nare in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not. \u201c[I]t is,\u201d\nas we have noted, \u201ca complete fiction to argue that an\nunconstitutional . . . expenditure causes an individual . . .\ntaxpayer any measurable economic harm.\u201d Hein, 551\nU. S., at 593 (plurality opinion). That is as true in Estab\nlishment Clause cases as in any others. Taxpayers have\nstanding in these cases despite their foreseeable failure to\nshow that the alleged constitutional violation involves\ntheir own tax dollars, not because the State has used their\nparticular funds.\n   And something still deeper is wrong with the majority\u2019s\n\u201cextract and spend\u201d requirement: It does not measure\nwhat matters under the Establishment Clause. Let us\nindulge the Court\u2019s fiction that a taxpayer\u2019s\n\u201c.000000000001 penny\u201d is somehow involved in an ordi\nnary appropriation of public funds for religious activity\n(thus supposedly distinguishing it from a tax expenditure).\nStill, consider the following example: Imagine the Internal\nRevenue Service places a checkbox on tax returns asking\nfilers if they object to the government using their taxes to\naid religion. If the government keeps \u201cyes\u201d money sepa\nrate from \u201cno\u201d money and subsidizes religious activities\nonly from the nonobjectors\u2019 account, the majority\u2019s analy\nsis suggests that no taxpayer would have standing to\nallege a violation of the Establishment Clause. The funds\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

But this Court has\nnever indicated that States may insulate subsidies to\nreligious organizations from legal challenge by eliciting\nthe consent of some taxpayers. And the Court has of\ncourse been right not to take this approach. Taxpayers\nincur the same harm, and should have the same ability to\nbring suit, whether the government stores tax funds in\none bank account or two. None of the principles underly\ning the Establishment Clause suggests otherwise.\n   James Madison, whom the Court again rightly labels\n\u201cthe leading architect of the religion clauses,\u201d ante, at 13\n(quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at 103; internal quotation marks\nomitted), had something important to say about the mat\nter of \u201cextraction.\u201d As the majority notes, Madison\u2019s Me\nmorial and Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed in\nVirginia to aid teachers of the Christian religion. Ante, at\n12\u201313. But Madison\u2019s passionate opposition to that pro\nposal informs this case in a manner different than the\nmajority suggests. The Virginia tax in fact would not have\nextracted any monies (not even \u201cthree pence\u201d) from unwill\ning citizens, as the Court now requires. The plan allowed\nconscientious objectors to opt out of subsidizing religion by\ncontributing their assessment to an alternative fund for\nthe construction and maintenance of county schools.11 See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  opt-out provision described county schools as \u201cseminaries of\nlearning.\u201d A Bill for Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the\nChristian Religion, reprinted in Everson v.

Ante, at 13. Because the Assessment\nnever became law, no one can know which county schools would have\nreceived aid; indeed, the first of these schools did not open its doors\nuntil decades later. See W. Miller, First Liberty 26 (2003); see gener\nally J. Buck, Development of Public Schools in Virginia 1607\u20131952\n(1952). But historians and legal scholars have uniformly understood\nthe opt-out provision as a considered attempt to accommodate taxpay\ners who did not want their tax dollars to go to religion. See Berg &\nLaycock, supra, at 244, n. 113 (the \u201cprovision for payment to a school\nfund was not an effort to support religious schools as part of support for\neducation overall,\u201d but rather \u201cwas an effort to accommodate the\npossibility of non-Christian taxpayers\u201d); T.

Although both funnel tax funds to\nreligious organizations (and so saddle all taxpayers with\nthe cost), neither forces any given taxpayer to pay for the\nsubsidy out of her pocket. Madison thought that feature of\nthe Assessment insufficient to save it. By relying on the\nselfsame aspect of the Arizona scheme to deny the Plain\ntiffs\u2019 claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison\u2019s vision.\n                             III\n   Today\u2019s decision devastates taxpayer standing in Estab\nlishment Clause cases. The government, after all, often\nuses tax expenditures to subsidize favored persons and\nactivities. Still more, the government almost always has\nthis option. Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily\ninterchangeable; what is a cash grant today can be a tax\nbreak tomorrow. The Court\u2019s opinion thus offers a road\nmap\u2014more truly, just a one-step instruction\u2014to any\ngovernment that wishes to insulate its financing of reli\ngious activity from legal challenge. Structure the funding\nas a tax expenditure, and Flast will not stand in the way.\nNo taxpayer will have standing to object. However bla\ntantly the government may violate the Establishment\nClause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal courts.\n   And by ravaging Flast in this way, today\u2019s decision\ndamages one of this Nation\u2019s defining constitutional com\nmitments. \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion\u201d\u2014ten simple words that have\nstood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of American\nreligious liberty. Ten words that this Court has long\nunderstood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(1995); Adams & Emmerich, Heritage of Religious Liberty, 137 U.

The Court\u2019s ruling today will not shield all\nstate subsidies for religion from review; as the Court\nnotes, some persons alleging Establishment Clause viola\ntions have suffered individualized injuries, and therefore\nhave standing, independent of their taxpayer status. See\nante, at 1\u20132, 17\u201318. But Flast arose because \u201cthe taxing\nand spending power [may] be used to favor one religion\nover another or to support religion in general,\u201d 392 U. S.,\nat 103, without causing particularized harm to discrete\npersons. It arose because state sponsorship of religion\nsometimes harms individuals only (but this \u201conly\u201d is no\nsmall matter) in their capacity as contributing members of\nour national community. In those cases, the Flast Court\nthought, our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutral\nity still should be enforced.\n   Because that judgment was right then, and remains\nright today, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) In general, the mere fact that someone is a taxpayer does not\n    provide standing to seek relief in federal court. The typical assertion\n    of taxpayer standing rests on unjustifiable economic and political\n    speculation. See Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447; Doremus v.\n    Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429. When a government ex\n    pends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not nec\n    essarily suffer. Even assuming the State\u2019s coffers are depleted, find\n    ing injury would require a court to speculate \u201cthat elected officials\n    will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s tax bill to make up a deficit.\u201d\n    DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 344. And to find re\n    dressability a court must assume that, were the taxpayers\u2019 remedy\n    allowed, \u201clegislators [would] pass along the supposed increased reve\n    nue in the form of tax reductions.\u201d Ibid. These conclusions apply to\n    the present cases. The costs of education may be a significant portion\n    of Arizona\u2019s annual budget, but the tax credit, by facilitating the op\n    eration of both religious and secular private schools, could relieve the\n    burden on public schools and provide cost savings to the State. Even\n    if the tax credit had an adverse effect on Arizona\u2019s budget, problems\n    would remain. To find a particular injury in fact would require\n    speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by in\n    creasing respondents\u2019 tax liability. A causation finding would depend\n    on the additional assumption that any tax increase would be trace\n    able to the STO tax credit. And respondents have not established\n    that an injunction against the credit\u2019s application would prompt Ari\n    zona legislators to \u201cpass along [any] increased revenue [as] tax reduc\n    tions.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (c) Respondents\u2019 suit does not fall within the narrow exception to\n    the rule against taxpayer standing established in Flast v. Cohen, su\n    pra. There, federal taxpayers had standing to mount an Establish\n    ment Clause challenge to a federal statute providing General Treas\n    ury funds to support, inter alia, textbook purchases for religious\n    schools. To have standing under Flast, taxpayers must show (1) a\n    \u201clogical link\u201d between the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer status \u201cand the type of\n    legislative enactment attacked,\u201d and (2) \u201ca nexus\u201d between such tax\n    payer status and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional infringe\n    ment alleged.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102. Considering the two requirements\n    together, Flast explained that individuals suffer a particular injury\n    when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of \u201cthe\n    taxing and spending power,\u201d their property is transferred through\n    the Government\u2019s Treasury to a sectarian entity.

Rather, taxpayers are free to pay their\nown tax bills without contributing to an STO, to contribute to a reli-\ngious or secular STO of their choice, or to contribute to other charita-\nble organizations. Because the STO tax credit is not tantamount to a\nreligious tax, respondents have not alleged an injury for standing\npurposes. Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements\nof causation and redressability. When the government collects and\nspends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the\ntransfer of wealth; the resulting subsidy of religious activity is, under\nFlast, traceable to the government\u2019s expenditures; and an injunction\nagainst those expenditures would address taxpayer-plaintiffs\u2019 objec-\ntions of conscience. Here, by contrast, contributions result from the\ndecisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private\ncitizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and\ntaxpayers then contribute to STOs. Any injury the objectors may suf-\nfer are not fairly traceable to the government. And, while an injunc-\ntion most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy\nwould not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.\nPp. 10\u201316.\n   (d) Respondents\u2019 contrary position\u2014that Arizonans benefiting from\nthe tax credit in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs\u2014\nassumes that all income is government property, even if it has not\ncome into the tax collector\u2019s hands. That premise finds no basis in\nstanding jurisprudence. This Court has sometimes reached the merits\nin Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits as opposed to\ngovernmental expenditures. See Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388;\nCommittee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756;\nHunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734; Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New\nYork, 397 U. S. 664. But those cases did not mention standing and so\ndo not stand for the proposition that no jurisdictional defects existed.\nMoreover, it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio standing\ndeterminations in those cases depended on Flast, as there are other\nways of establishing standing in Establishment Clause cases involving\ntax benefits.

STOs use these contribu\u00ad\ntions to provide scholarships to students attending private\nschools, many of which are religious. Respondents are a\ngroup of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax\ncredit as a violation of Establishment Clause principles\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the\nArizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment\nClause claim on the merits, respondents sought interven\u00ad\ntion from the Federal Judiciary.\n   To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court,\nparties seeking relief must show that they have standing\nunder Article III of the Constitution. Standing in Estab\u00ad\n2   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nlishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways.\nSome plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the\ndirect harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of\nreligion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school\nclassroom. See School Dist. of Abington Township v.\nSchempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224, n. 9 (1963). Other plaintiffs\nmay demonstrate standing on the ground that they have\nincurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their\nreligion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged\ndiscrimination in the tax code, such as when the availabil\u00ad\nity of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affilia\u00ad\ntion. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8\n(1989) (plurality opinion).\n   For their part, respondents contend that they have\nstanding to challenge Arizona\u2019s STO tax credit for one and\nonly one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers. But\nthe mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally\ndeemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court.\nTo overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an excep\u00ad\ntion created in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968). For the\nreasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advan\u00ad\ntage of Flast\u2019s narrow exception to the general rule against\ntaxpayer standing. As a consequence, respondents lacked\nstanding to commence this action, and their suit must be\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n                                I\n   Respondents challenged \u00a743\u20131089, a provision of the\nArizona Tax Code. See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws \u00a743\u20131087,\ncodified, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a743\u20131089\n(West Supp. 2010). Section 43\u20131089 allows Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500\nper person and $1,000 per married couple for contribu\u00ad\ntions to STOs. \u00a743\u20131089(A). If the credit exceeds an\nindividual\u2019s tax liability, the credit\u2019s unused portion can be\ncarried forward up to five years. \u00a743\u20131089(D). Under a\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

See \u00a743\u20131089 (West\n2006). The organization was required to be exempt from\nfederal taxation under \u00a7501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986. \u00a743\u20131089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005). It could\nnot limit its scholarships to students attending only one\nschool. Ibid. And it had to allocate \u201cat least ninety per\ncent of its annual revenue for educational scholarships or\ntuition grants\u201d to children attending qualified schools.\nIbid. A \u201cqualified school,\u201d in turn, was defined in part as a\nprivate school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the\nbasis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or national\norigin. \u00a743\u20131089(G)(2).\n   In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers challenged \u00a743\u20131089, invoking both the United\nStates Constitution and the Arizona Constitution. The\nArizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers\u2019 claims on\nthe merits. Kotterman v.

It named the Direc\u00ad\ntor of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant.\nThe Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that\n\u00a743\u20131089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment, as incorporated against the States by the\nFourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that \u00a743\u2013\n1089 allows STOs \u201cto use State income-tax revenues to\npay tuition for students at religious schools,\u201d some of\nwhich \u201cdiscriminate on the basis of religion in selecting\nstudents.\u201d Complaint in No. 00\u20130287 (D Ariz.), \u00b6\u00b629\u201331,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09\u2013987, pp. 125a\u2013126a.

The District Court dis\u00ad\nmissed respondents\u2019 suit as jurisdictionally barred by the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71341. The Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals reversed. This Court agreed with the Court of\nAppeals and affirmed. Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004).\n  On remand, the Arizona Christian School Tuition Or\u00ad\nganization and other interested parties intervened. The\nDistrict Court once more dismissed respondents\u2019 suit, this\ntime for failure to state a claim. Once again, the Court of\nAppeals reversed. It held that respondents had standing\nunder Flast v. Cohen, supra. 562 F. 3d 1002 (CA9 2009).\nReaching the merits, the Court of Appeals ruled that\nrespondents had stated a claim that \u00a743\u20131089 violated the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment. The full\nCourt of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges\ndissenting. 586 F. 3d 649 (CA9 2009). This Court granted\ncertiorari. 560 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II\n   The concept and operation of the separation of powers\nin our National Government have their principal founda\u00ad\ntion in the first three Articles of the Constitution. Under\nArticle III, the Federal Judiciary is vested with the\n\u201cPower\u201d to resolve not questions and issues but \u201cCases\u201d or\n\u201cControversies.\u201d This language restricts the federal judi\u00ad\ncial power \u201cto the traditional role of the Anglo-American\ncourts.\u201d Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 4). In the English legal tradition,\nthe need to redress an injury resulting from a specific\ndispute taught the efficacy of judicial resolution and gave\nlegitimacy to judicial decrees. The importance of resolving\nspecific cases was visible, for example, in the incremental\napproach of the common law and in equity\u2019s consideration\nof exceptional circumstances. The Framers paid heed to\nthese lessons. See U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe judicial\nPower shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity . . . \u201d).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBy rules consistent with the longstanding practices of\nAnglo-American courts a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the\nfederal judicial power must assert more than just the\n\u201cgeneralized interest of all citizens in constitutional gov\u00ad\nernance.\u201d Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the\nWar, 418 U. S. 208, 217 (1974).\n   Continued adherence to the case-or-controversy re\u00ad\nquirement of Article III maintains the public\u2019s confidence\nin an unelected but restrained Federal Judiciary. If the\njudicial power were \u201cextended to every question under the\nconstitution,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall once explained,\nfederal courts might take possession of \u201calmost every\nsubject proper for legislative discussion and decision.\u201d 4\nPapers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984) (quoted in\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 341 (2006)).\nThe legislative and executive departments of the Federal\nGovernment, no less than the judicial department, have a\nduty to defend the Constitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI,\ncl. 3. That shared obligation is incompatible with the\nsuggestion that federal courts might wield an \u201cuncondi\u00ad\ntioned authority to determine the constitutionality of\nlegislative or executive acts.\u201d Valley Forge Christian\nCollege v. Americans United for Separation of Church and\nState, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). For the federal\ncourts to decide questions of law arising outside of cases\nand controversies would be inimical to the Constitution\u2019s\ndemocratic character. And the resulting conflict between\nthe judicial and the political branches would not, \u201cin the\nlong run, be beneficial to either.\u201d United States v.\nRichardson, 418 U. S. 166, 188\u2013189 (1974) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring). Instructed by Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s admo\u00ad\nnition, this Court takes care to observe the \u201crole assigned\nto the judiciary\u201d within the Constitution\u2019s \u201ctripartite\nallocation of power.\u201d Valley Forge, supra, at 474 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n6   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n   To state a case or controversy under Article III, a plain\u00ad\ntiff must establish standing. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.\n737, 751 (1984). The minimum constitutional require\u00ad\nments for standing were explained in Lujan v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992).\n     \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in\n     fact\u2019\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which\n     is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or\n     imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Sec\u00ad\n     ond, there must be a causal connection between the\n     injury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury has\n     to be \u2018fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of\n     the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the inde\u00ad\n     pendent action of some third party not before the\n     court.\u2019 Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely\n     \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a fa\u00ad\n     vorable decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 560\u2013561 (citations and foot\u00ad\n     note omitted).\nIn requiring a particular injury, the Court meant \u201cthat the\ninjury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individ\u00ad\nual way.\u201d Id., at 560, n. 1. The question now before the\nCourt is whether respondents, the plaintiffs in the trial\ncourt, satisfy the requisite elements of standing.\n                             A\n  Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona tax\u00ad\npayers provides them with standing to challenge the STO\ntax credit. Absent special circumstances, however, stand\u00ad\ning cannot be based on a plaintiff\u2019s mere status as a tax\u00ad\npayer. This Court has rejected the general proposition\nthat an individual who has paid taxes has a \u201ccontinuing,\nlegally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds\nare not used by the Government in a way that violates the\nConstitution.\u201d Hein v. Freedom From Religion Founda\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599 (2007) (plurality opinion).\nThis precept has been referred to as the rule against tax\u00ad\npayer standing.\n   The doctrinal basis for the rule was discussed in Froth\ningham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923) (decided with\nMassachusetts v. Mellon). There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had\nalleged that certain federal expenditures were in excess\nof congressional authority under the Constitution. The\nplaintiff argued that she had standing to raise her claim\nbecause she had an interest in the Government Treasury\nand because the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of\nGovernment funds would affect her personal tax liability.\nThe Court rejected those arguments. The \u201ceffect upon\nfuture taxation, of any payment out of funds,\u201d was too\n\u201cremote, fluctuating and uncertain\u201d to give rise to a case\nor controversy. Id., at 487. And the taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s\n\u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury,\u201d the Court recog\u00ad\nnized, was necessarily \u201cshared with millions of others.\u201d\nIbid. As a consequence, Frothingham held that the tax\u00ad\npayer-plaintiff had not presented a \u201cjudicial controversy\u201d\nappropriate for resolution in federal court but rather a\n\u201cmatter of public . . . concern\u201d that could be pursued only\nthrough the political process. Id., at 487\u2013489.\n   In a second pertinent case, Doremus v. Board of Ed. of\nHawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952), the Court considered\nFrothingham\u2019s prohibition on taxpayer standing in con\u00ad\nnection with an alleged Establishment Clause violation. A\nNew Jersey statute had provided that public school teach\u00ad\ners would read Bible verses to their students at the start\nof each schoolday. A plaintiff sought to have the law\nenjoined, asserting standing based on her status as a\ntaxpayer. Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson reiter\u00ad\nated the foundational role that Article III standing plays\nin our separation of powers.\n8   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201c \u2018The party who invokes the power [of the federal\n     courts] must be able to show not only that the statute\n     is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately\n     in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result\n     of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in\n     some indefinite way in common with people gener\u00ad\n     ally.\u2019 \u201d Doremus, supra, at 434 (quoting Frothingham,\n     supra, at 488).\nThe plaintiff in Doremus lacked any \u201cdirect and particular\nfinancial interest\u201d in the suit, and, as a result, a decision\non the merits would have been merely \u201cadvisory.\u201d 342\nU. S., at 434\u2013435. It followed that the plaintiff\u2019s allega\u00ad\ntions did not give rise to a case or controversy subject to\njudicial resolution under Article III. Ibid. Cf. School Dist.\nof Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 224, n. 9\n(finding standing where state laws required Bible readings\nor prayer in public schools, not because plaintiffs were\nstate taxpayers but because their children were enrolled\nin public schools and so were \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by the\nchallenged laws).\n   In holdings consistent with Frothingham and Doremus,\nmore recent decisions have explained that claims of tax\u00ad\npayer standing rest on unjustifiable economic and political\nspeculation. When a government expends resources or\ndeclines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily\nsuffer. On the contrary, the purpose of many governmen\u00ad\ntal expenditures and tax benefits is \u201cto spur economic\nactivity, which in turn increases government revenues.\u201d\nDaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344.\n   Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expendi\u00ad\nture or tax benefit depletes the government\u2019s coffers. To\nfind injury, a court must speculate \u201cthat elected officials\nwill increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s tax bill to make up a\ndeficit.\u201d Ibid.

It\nwould be \u201cpure speculation\u201d to conclude that an injunction\nagainst a government expenditure or tax benefit \u201cwould\nresult in any actual tax relief\u201d for a taxpayer-plaintiff.\nASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion\nof KENNEDY, J.).\n   These well-established principles apply to the present\ncases. Respondents may be right that Arizona\u2019s STO tax\ncredits have an estimated annual value of over $50 mil\u00ad\nlion. See Brief for Respondent Winn et al. 42; see also\nArizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s\nTax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15,\n2010) (reporting the total estimated \u201cvalue\u201d of STO tax\ncredits claimed over a 1-year period). The education of its\nyoung people is, of course, one of the State\u2019s principal\nmissions and responsibilities; and the consequent costs\nwill make up a significant portion of the state budget.\nThat, however, is just the beginning of the analysis.\n   By helping students obtain scholarships to private\nschools, both religious and secular, the STO program\nmight relieve the burden placed on Arizona\u2019s public\nschools. The result could be an immediate and permanent\ncost savings for the State. See Brief for Petitioner Arizona\nChristian School Tuition Organization 31 (discussing\nstudies indicating that the STO program may on net save\nthe State money); see also Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388,\n395 (1983) (\u201cBy educating a substantial number of stu\u00ad\ndents [private] schools relieve public schools of a corre\u00ad\nspondingly great burden\u2014to the benefit of all taxpayers\u201d).\nUnderscoring the potential financial benefits of the STO\nprogram, the average value of an STO scholarship may be\nfar less than the average cost of educating an Arizona\npublic school student. See Brief for Petitioner Garriott 38.\nBecause it encourages scholarships for attendance at\nprivate schools, the STO tax credit may not cause the\n10 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nState to incur any financial loss.\n   Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect\non Arizona\u2019s annual budget, problems would remain. To\nconclude there is a particular injury in fact would require\nspeculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue\nshortfalls by increasing respondents\u2019 tax liability. Daim\nlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. A finding of causation\nwould depend on the additional determination that any\ntax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as\ndistinct from other governmental expenditures or other\ntax benefits. Respondents have not established that an\ninjunction against application of the STO tax credit would\nprompt Arizona legislators to \u201cpass along the supposed\nincreased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\u201d Ibid.\nThose matters, too, are conjectural.\n   Each of the inferential steps to show causation and\nredressability depends on premises as to which there\nremains considerable doubt. The taxpayers have not\nshown that any interest they have in protecting the State\nTreasury would be advanced. Even were they to show\nsome closer link, that interest is still of a general charac\u00ad\nter, not particular to certain persons. Nor have the tax\u00ad\npayers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition\ncredit scheme. The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule\ndesigned both to avoid speculation and to insist on par\u00ad\nticular injury, applies to respondents\u2019 lawsuit. The tax\u00ad\npayers, then, must rely on an exception to the rule, an\nexception next to be considered.\n                              B\n  The primary contention of respondents, of course, is\nthat, despite the general rule that taxpayers lack standing\nto object to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional,\ntheir suit falls within the exception established by Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83. It must be noted at the outset that,\nas this Court has explained, Flast\u2019s holding provides a\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to \u201cthe general rule against taxpayer\nstanding.\u201d Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988).\n   At issue in Flast was the standing of federal taxpayers\nto object, on First Amendment grounds, to a congressional\nstatute that allowed expenditures of federal funds from\nthe General Treasury to support, among other programs,\n\u201cinstruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in\nreligious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other\ninstructional materials for use in such schools.\u201d 392 U. S.,\nat 85\u201386. Flast held that taxpayers have standing when\ntwo conditions are met.\n   The first condition is that there must be a \u201clogical link\u201d\nbetween the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer status \u201cand the type of\nlegislative enactment attacked.\u201d Id., at 102. This condi\u00ad\ntion was not satisfied in Doremus because the statute\nchallenged in that case\u2014providing for the recitation of\nBible passages in public schools\u2014involved at most an\n\u201cincidental expenditure of tax funds.\u201d Flast, 392 U. S., at\n102. In Flast, by contrast, the allegation was that the\nFederal Government violated the Establishment Clause in\nthe exercise of its legislative authority both to collect and\nspend tax dollars. Id., at 103. In the decades since Flast,\nthe Court has been careful to enforce this requirement.\nSee Hein, 551 U. S. 587 (no standing under Flast to chal\u00ad\nlenge federal executive actions funded by general appro\u00ad\npriations); Valley Forge, 454 U. S. 464 (no standing under\nFlast to challenge an agency\u2019s decision to transfer a parcel\nof federal property pursuant to the Property Clause).\n   The second condition for standing under Flast is that\nthere must be \u201ca nexus\u201d between the plaintiff\u2019s taxpayer\nstatus and \u201cthe precise nature of the constitutional in\u00ad\nfringement alleged.\u201d 392 U. S., at 102. This condition was\ndeemed satisfied in Flast based on the allegation that\nGovernment funds had been spent on an outlay for relig\u00ad\nion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. Id., at\n85\u201386. In Frothingham, by contrast, the claim was that\n12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress had exceeded its constitutional authority with\u00ad\nout regard to any specific prohibition. 392 U. S., at 104\u2013\n105. Confirming that Flast turned on the unique features\nof Establishment Clause violations, this Court has \u201cde\u00ad\nclined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging\nviolations of any constitutional provision apart from the\nEstablishment Clause.\u201d Hein, supra, at 609 (plurality\nopinion); see also Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (Statement\nand Account Clause); Schlesinger, 418 U. S. 208 (Incom\u00ad\npatibility Clause).\n   After stating the two conditions for taxpayer standing,\nFlast considered them together, explaining that individu\u00ad\nals suffer a particular injury for standing purposes when,\nin violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of\n\u201cthe taxing and spending power,\u201d their property is trans\u00ad\nferred through the Government\u2019s Treasury to a sectarian\nentity. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. As Flast put it: \u201cThe tax\u00ad\npayer\u2019s allegation in such cases would be that his tax\nmoney is being extracted and spent in violation of specific\nconstitutional protections against such abuses of legisla\u00ad\ntive power.\u201d Id., at 106. Flast thus \u201cunderstood the \u2018in\u00ad\njury\u2019 alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal\nspending to be the very \u2018extract[ion] and spen[ding]\u2019 of \u2018tax\nmoney\u2019 in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.\u201d Daimler-\nChrysler, 547 U. S., at 348 (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at\n106)). \u201cSuch an injury,\u201d Flast continued, is unlike \u201cgener\u00ad\nalized grievances about the conduct of government\u201d and so\nis \u201cappropriate for judicial redress.\u201d Id., at 106.\n   Flast found support for its finding of personal injury in\n\u201cthe history of the Establishment Clause,\u201d particularly\nJames Madison\u2019s Memorial and Remonstrance Against\nReligious Assessments. DaimlerChrysler, supra, at 348.\nIn 1785, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\nVirginia considered a \u201ctax levy to support teachers of the\nChristian religion.\u201d Flast, supra, at 104, n. 24; see A Bill\nEstablishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReligion, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,\n330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of\nRutledge, J.). Under the proposed assessment bill, tax\u00ad\npayers would direct their payments to Christian societies\nof their choosing. Ibid. If a taxpayer made no such choice,\nthe General Assembly was to divert his funds to \u201cseminar\u00ad\nies of learning,\u201d at least some of which \u201cundoubtedly would\nhave been religious in character.\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 869, n. 1 (1995)\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also id., at 853, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring). How\u00ad\never the \u201cseminaries\u201d provision might have functioned in\npractice, critics took the position that the proposed bill\nthreatened compulsory religious contributions. See, e.g.,\nT. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia,\n1776\u20131787, pp. 133\u2013134 (1977); H. Eckenrode, Separation\nof Church and State in Virginia 106\u2013108 (1910).\n   In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to\nthe proposed assessment on the ground that it would\ncoerce a form of religious devotion in violation of con\u00ad\nscience. In Madison\u2019s view, government should not \u201c \u2018force\na citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for\nthe support of any one establishment.\u2019 \u201d Flast, supra, at\n103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G.\nHunt ed. 1901)). This Madisonian prohibition does not\ndepend on the amount of property conscripted for sectar\u00ad\nian ends. Any such taking, even one amounting to \u201cthree\npence only,\u201d violates conscience. 392 U. S., at 103; cf.\nsupra, at 6\u20137. The proposed bill ultimately died in com\u00ad\nmittee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legisla\u00ad\ntion forbidding \u201ccompelled\u201d support of religion. See A Bill\nfor Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers\nof Thomas Jefferson 545\u2013546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also\nFlast, 392 U. S., at 104, n. 24. Madison himself went on to\nbecome, as Flast put it, \u201cthe leading architect of the relig\u00ad\nion clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 103. Flast\n14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nwas thus informed by \u201cthe specific evils\u201d identified in the\npublic arguments of \u201cthose who drafted the Establishment\nClause and fought for its adoption.\u201d Id., at 103\u2013104; see\nalso Feldman, Intellectual Origins of the Establishment\nClause, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 346, 351 (2002) (\u201c[T]he Fram\u00ad\ners\u2019 generation worried that conscience would be violated\nif citizens were required to pay taxes to support religious\ninstitutions with whose beliefs they disagreed\u201d); McCon\u00ad\nnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment, 27\nWm. & Mary L. Rev. 933, 936\u2013939 (1986).\n   Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate\ntheir standing to challenge the STO tax credit. In their\nview the tax credit is, for Flast purposes, best understood\nas a governmental expenditure. That is incorrect.\n   It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental ex\u00ad\npenditures can have similar economic consequences, at\nleast for beneficiaries whose tax liability is sufficiently\nlarge to take full advantage of the credit. Yet tax credits\nand governmental expenditures do not both implicate\nindividual taxpayers in sectarian activities. A dissenter\nwhose tax dollars are \u201cextracted and spent\u201d knows that he\nhas in some small measure been made to contribute to an\nestablishment in violation of conscience. Flast, supra, at\n106. In that instance the taxpayer\u2019s direct and particular\nconnection with the establishment does not depend on\neconomic speculation or political conjecture. The connec\u00ad\ntion would exist even if the conscientious dissenter\u2019s tax\nliability were unaffected or reduced. See DaimlerChrysler,\nsupra, at 348\u2013349. When the government declines to\nimpose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection\nbetween dissenting taxpayer and alleged establishment.\nAny financial injury remains speculative. See supra, at 6\u2013\n10. And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other\ncitizens to retain control over their own funds in accor\u00ad\ndance with their own consciences.\n   The distinction between governmental expenditures and\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntax credits refutes respondents\u2019 assertion of standing.\nWhen Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs,\nthey spend their own money, not money the State has\ncollected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Ari\u00ad\nzona\u2019s \u00a743\u20131089 does not \u201cextrac[t] and spen[d]\u201d a consci\u00ad\nentious dissenter\u2019s funds in service of an establishment,\nFlast, 392 U. S., at 106, or \u201c \u2018force a citizen to contribute\nthree pence only of his property\u2019 \u201d to a sectarian organiza\u00ad\ntion, id., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison,\nsupra, at 186). On the contrary, respondents and other\nArizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills,\nwithout contributing to an STO. Respondents are likewise\nable to contribute to an STO of their choice, either reli\u00ad\ngious or secular. And respondents also have the option of\ncontributing to other charitable organizations, in which\ncase respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction\nor a different tax credit. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a743\u20131088 (West Supp. 2010). The STO tax credit is not\ntantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not\nvisit the injury identified in Flast. It follows that respon\u00ad\ndents have neither alleged an injury for standing purposes\nunder general rules nor met the Flast exception. Finding\nstanding under these circumstances would be more than\nthe extension of Flast \u201cto the limits of its logic.\u201d Hein, 551\nU. S., at 615 (plurality opinion). It would be a departure\nfrom Flast\u2019s stated rationale.\n   Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the require\u00ad\nments of causation and redressability. When the govern\u00ad\nment collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental\nchoices are responsible for the transfer of wealth. In that\ncase a resulting subsidy of religious activity is, for pur\u00ad\nposes of Flast, traceable to the government\u2019s expenditures.\nAnd an injunction against those expenditures would ad\u00ad\ndress the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer\u00ad\nplaintiffs. See DaimlerChrysler, 547 U. S., at 344. Here,\nby contrast, contributions result from the decisions of\n16 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate taxpayers regarding their own funds. Private\ncitizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary\nschools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs. While the\nState, at the outset, affords the opportunity to create and\ncontribute to an STO, the tax credit system is imple\u00ad\nmented by private action and with no state intervention.\nObjecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not\nthe State, decide to contribute and in fact make the con\u00ad\ntribution. These considerations prevent any injury the\nobjectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the\ngovernment. And while an injunction against application\nof the tax credit most likely would reduce contributions to\nSTOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing tax\u00ad\npayers or their tax payments. As a result, any injury\nsuffered by respondents would not be remedied by an\ninjunction limiting the tax credit\u2019s operation.\n   Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that\nArizonans who benefit from \u00a743\u20131089 tax credits in effect\nare paying their state income tax to STOs. In respon\u00ad\ndents\u2019 view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax\ndeductions do not, since only the former yield a dollar-for\u00ad\ndollar reduction in final tax liability. See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent Winn et al. 5\u20136; Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\u201336. But\nwhat matters under Flast is whether sectarian STOs\nreceive government funds drawn from general tax reve\u00ad\nnues, so that moneys have been extracted from a citizen\nand handed to a religious institution in violation of the\ncitizen\u2019s conscience. Under that inquiry, respondents\u2019\nargument fails. Like contributions that lead to charitable\ntax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits are\nnot owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from tax\u00ad\npayers to private organizations. Respondents\u2019 contrary\nposition assumes that income should be treated as if it\nwere government property even if it has not come into the\ntax collector\u2019s hands. That premise finds no basis in\nstanding jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot be\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nequated with the Arizona State Treasury.\n   The conclusion that the Flast exception is inapplicable\nat first may seem in tension with several earlier cases, all\naddressing Establishment Clause issues and all decided\nafter Flast. See Mueller, 463 U. S. 388; Committee for\nPublic Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756\n(1973); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973); Walz v. Tax\nComm\u2019n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970); cf.\nHibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (reaching only threshold\njurisdictional issues). But those cases do not mention\nstanding and so are not contrary to the conclusion reached\nhere. When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither\nnoted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does\nnot stand for the proposition that no defect existed. See,\ne.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974)\n(\u201c[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in\nprior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never consid-\nered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings\nthe jurisdictional issue before us\u201d); United States v. L. A.\nTucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (\u201cEven as\nto our own judicial power of jurisdiction, this Court has\nfollowed the lead of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall who held\nthat this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdic-\ntion in a case where it was not questioned and it was\npassed sub silentio\u201d); Frothingham, supra, at 486. The\nCourt would risk error if it relied on assumptions that\nhave gone unstated and unexamined.\n   Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit,\ndisadvantages a particular religious group or a particular\nnonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not\nhave to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting\ninjury. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 8\n(plurality opinion) (finding standing where a general\ninterest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the\nground that religious periodicals were exempt from the\ntax). Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can\nbe shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any\n18 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nnonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases respondents\ncite would have depended on Flast. See, e.g., Walz, supra,\nat 666\u2013667 (explaining that the plaintiff was an \u201cowner of\nreal estate\u201d in New York City who objected to the city\u2019s\nissuance of \u201cproperty tax exemptions to religious organiza\u00ad\ntions\u201d). That the plaintiffs in those cases could have\nadvanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast\nmakes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether\nor why standing should have been found where the issue\nwas left unexplored.\n   If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real\ninjury to particular individuals, the federal courts may\nadjudicate the matter. Like other constitutional provi\u00ad\nsions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and\nmeaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the\ncontext of actual disputes. That reality underlies the case\u00ad\nor-controversy requirement, a requirement that has not\nbeen satisfied here.\n                         *    *     *\n   Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to\nundermine public confidence in the neutrality and integ\u00ad\nrity of the Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the\nrole of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power\nto invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees\nwith them. In an era of frequent litigation, class actions,\nsweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continu\u00ad\ning jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must\nbe more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing,\nnot less so. Making the Article III standing inquiry all the\nmore necessary are the significant implications of consti\u00ad\ntutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide appli\u00ad\ncability that are beyond Congress\u2019 power to change.\n   The present suit serves as an illustration of these prin\u00ad\nciples.

S. 83 (1968), and continuing in case after case for\n2   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nover four decades, this Court and others have exercised\njurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not\nmaterially different from this one. Not every suit has\nsucceeded on the merits, or should have. But every tax\npayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the\ngovernment\u2019s financing of religious activity.\n   Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing\nto hear taxpayers\u2019 claims that the government has uncon\nstitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system.\nThese litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because\nthe funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax\ncredit, rather than an appropriation. A tax credit, the\nCourt asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because\nit \u201cdoes not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an\nestablishment.\u201d Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted).\n   This novel distinction in standing law between appro\npriations and tax expenditures has as little basis in prin\nciple as it has in our precedent. Cash grants and targeted\ntax breaks are means of accomplishing the same govern\nment objective\u2014to provide financial support to select\nindividuals or organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state\naid of religion have equal reason to protest whether that\naid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either\nway, the government has financed the religious activity.\nAnd so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge\nthe subsidy.\n   Still worse, the Court\u2019s arbitrary distinction threatens to\neliminate all occasions for a taxpayer to contest the gov\nernment\u2019s monetary support of religion. Precisely because\nappropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objec\ntives, the government can easily substitute one for the\nother. Today\u2019s opinion thus enables the government to\nend-run Flast\u2019s guarantee of access to the Judiciary. From\nnow on, the government need follow just one simple rule\u2014\nsubsidize through the tax system\u2014to preclude taxpayer\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nchallenges to state funding of religion.\n  And that result\u2014the effective demise of taxpayer stand\ning\u2014will diminish the Establishment Clause\u2019s force and\nmeaning. Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has\nsuffered the injury necessary to challenge government\nsponsorship of religion. Today\u2019s holding therefore will\nprevent federal courts from determining whether some\nsubsidies to sectarian organizations comport with our\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality. Because I\nbelieve these challenges warrant consideration on the\nmerits, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.\n                             I\n  As the majority recounts, this Court has held that pay\ning taxes usually does not give an individual Article III\nstanding to challenge government action. Ante, at 6\u201310.\nTaxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury be\ncause each person\u2019s \u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treas\nury . . . is comparatively minute and indeterminable.\u201d\nFrothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923) (decided\nwith Massachusetts v. Mellon). Given the size and com\nplexity of government budgets, it is a \u201cfiction\u201d to contend\nthat an unlawful expenditure causes an individual \u201cany\nmeasurable economic harm.\u201d Hein v. Freedom From\nReligion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 593 (2007) (plu\nrality opinion). Nor can taxpayers in the ordinary case\nestablish causation (i.e., that the disputed government\nmeasure affects their tax burden) or redressability (i.e.,\nthat a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions).\nAnte, at 8\u20139. On these points, all agree.\n  The disagreement concerns their relevance here. This\ncase is not about the general prohibition on taxpayer\nstanding, and cannot be resolved on that basis. This case\nis instead about the exception to the rule\u2014the principle\nestablished decades ago in Flast that taxpayers may chal\nlenge certain government actions alleged to violate the\n4   ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                          WINN\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nEstablishment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if\ntheir suit meets Flast\u2019s requirements\u2014and it does so\nunder any fair reading of that decision.\n   Taxpayers have standing, Flast held, when they allege\nthat a statute enacted pursuant to the legislature\u2019s taxing\nand spending power violates the Establishment Clause.\n392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. In this situation, the Court ex\nplained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus \u201cbe\ntween the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought\nto be adjudicated.\u201d Id., at 102. First, by challenging\nlegislative action taken under the taxing and spending\nclause, the taxpayer shows \u201ca logical link between [her]\nstatus and the type of . . . enactment attacked.\u201d Ibid.\nSecond, by invoking the Establishment Clause\u2014a specific\nlimitation on the legislature\u2019s taxing and spending\npower\u2014the taxpayer demonstrates \u201ca nexus between [her]\nstatus and the precise nature of the constitutional in\nfringement alleged.\u201d Ibid. Because of these connections,\nFlast held, taxpayers alleging that the government is\nusing tax proceeds to aid religion have \u201cthe necessary\nstake . . . in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article\nIII.\u201d Ibid. They are \u201cproper and appropriate part[ies]\u201d\u2014\nindeed, often the only possible parties\u2014to seek judicial\nenforcement of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious\nneutrality. Ibid.\n   That simple restatement of the Flast standard should be\nenough to establish that the Plaintiffs have standing.\nThey attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the\nlegislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution\u2019s\ntaxing and spending clause (Flast nexus, part 1). And\nthey allege that this provision violates the Establishment\nClause (Flast nexus, part 2). By satisfying both of Flast\u2019s\nconditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their \u201cstake\nas taxpayers\u201d in enforcing constitutional restraints on the\nprovision of aid to STOs. Ibid.

Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 119 (2004)\n(Winn I) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\nFinding standing here is merely a matter of applying\nFlast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndetermination (not questioned even by the eight judges\nwho called for rehearing en banc on the merits) that the\nPlaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.\n                             II\n  The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguish\ning between two methods of financing religion: A taxpayer\nhas standing to challenge state subsidies to religion, the\nCourt announces, when the mechanism used is an appro\npriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax\nbreak, otherwise called a \u201ctax expenditure.\u201d1 In the for\nmer case, but not in the latter, the Court declares, the\ntaxpayer suffers cognizable injury.

In the decades since Flast, no\ncourt\u2014not one\u2014has differentiated between appropriations\nand tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have\nstanding. Over and over again, courts (including this one)\nhave faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits,\ndeductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these\ncourts have reached the merits of these claims. And that\nis for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same\ninjury for standing purposes whether government subsidi\nzation of religion takes the form of a cash grant or a tax\nmeasure. The only rationale the majority offers for its\nnewfound distinction\u2014that grants, but not tax expendi\ntures, somehow come from a complaining taxpayer\u2019s own\nwallet\u2014cannot bear the weight the Court places on it. If\nFlast is still good law\u2014and the majority today says noth\ning to the contrary\u2014then the Plaintiffs should be able to\npursue their claim on the merits.\n                              A\n   Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that\nlitigants in the same shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing\nunder Flast. To the contrary: We have faced the identical\nsituation five times\u2014including in a prior incarnation of\nthis very case!\u2014and we have five times resolved the suit\nwithout questioning the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. Lower fed\neral courts have followed our example and handled the\nmatter in the same way. I count 14 separate cases (involv\ning 20 appellate and district courts) that adjudicated\ntaxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to violate\nthe Establishment Clause.2 I suspect I have missed a few.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See Johnson v.

We first took up such a\nchallenge in Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New York, 397\nU. S. 664, 666\u2013667 (1970), where we upheld the constitu\ntionality of a property tax exemption for religious organi\nzations. Next, in Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.

The same day, in Committee for\nPublic Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756,\n789\u2013794 (1973), we struck down a state tax deduction for\nparents who paid tuition at religious and other private\nschools. A decade later, in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.

S. 589, 619 (1988) (finding\nstanding partly because the Court, in deciding similar\ncases, had \u201cnot questioned the standing of taxpayer plain\ntiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges\u201d); Bank of\nUnited States v.

And that principle has extra force here, because\nwe have relied on some of these decisions to support the\nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction in other cases. Pause on that for a\nmoment: The very decisions the majority today so easily\ndismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of\njurisdiction. So in School Dist. of Grand Rapids v.

And in Winn I\n(recall, an earlier iteration of this case), we rejected a\ndifferent jurisdictional objection in part by relying on\nMueller and Nyquist. We called those cases \u201cadjudications\nof great moment discerning no [jurisdictional] barrier\u201d and\nwarned that they could not \u201cbe written off as reflecting\nnothing more than unexamined custom or unthinking\nhabit.\u201d 542 U.

Until today, that is\u2014when the\nmajority does write off these adjudications and reaches a\nresult against all precedent.\n                              B\n   Our taxpayer standing cases have declined to distin\nguish between appropriations and tax expenditures for a\nsimple reason: Here, as in many contexts, the distinction\nis one in search of a difference. To begin to see why, con\nsider an example far afield from Flast and, indeed, from\nreligion. Imagine that the Federal Government decides it\nshould pay hundreds of billions of dollars to insolvent\nbanks in the midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that\nmany millions of taxpayers oppose this bailout on the\nground (whether right or wrong is immaterial) that it uses\ntheir hard-earned money to reward irresponsible business\nbehavior. In the face of this hostility, some Members of\nCongress make the following proposal: Rather than give\nthe money to banks via appropriations, the Government\nwill allow banks to subtract the exact same amount from\nthe tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U. S.\nTreasury. Would this proposal calm the furor? Or would\nmost taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a\nsubsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished\nby the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; in\n12 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndeed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they\nfailed to see through this cynical proposal.\n  And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court\u2019s\ncase law also recognizes\u2014that targeted tax breaks are\noften \u201ceconomically and functionally indistinguishable\nfrom a direct monetary subsidy.\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 859 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). Tax credits, deductions, and\nexemptions provided to an individual or organization have\n\u201cmuch the same effect as a cash grant to the [recipient] of\nthe amount of tax it would have to pay\u201d absent the tax\nbreak. Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash.,\n461 U. S. 540, 544 (1983). \u201cOur opinions,\u201d therefore, \u201chave\nlong recognized . . . the reality that [tax expenditures] are\na form of subsidy that is administered through the tax\nsystem.\u201d Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. v.

S. 564,\n589\u2013590, n. 22 (1997), even assuming the diverted tax\nfunds do not pass through the public treasury. And once\nmore: Both special tax benefits and cash grants \u201crepre\nsen[t] a charge made upon the state,\u201d Nyquist, 413 U.

That may be so in the long\nrun (although the only non-speculative effect is to immediately dimin\nish funds in the public treasury). But as the majority acknowledges,\nibid., this possibility holds just as true for appropriations; that is why\nwe (optimistically) refer to some government outlays as \u201cinvestments.\u201d\nThe insight therefore cannot help the majority distinguish between tax\nexpenditures and appropriations.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The President must provide information\non the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget\nhe submits to Congress each year. See 31 U. S. C.\n\u00a71105(a)(16); n. 1, supra. Similarly, congressional budget\ncommittees must report to all Members on the level of\ntax expenditures in the federal budget. See 2 U. S. C.\n\u00a7632(e)(2)(E). Many States\u2014including Arizona\u2014likewise\ncompute the impact of targeted tax breaks on the public\ntreasury, in recognition that these measures are just\nspending under a different name, see n. 1, supra. The\nArizona Department of Revenue must issue an annual\nreport \u201cdetailing the approximate costs in lost revenue for\nall state tax expenditures.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a742\u2013\n1005(A)(4) (West 2006). The most recent report notes the\nsignificance of this accounting in the budget process. It\nexplains that \u201cthe fiscal impact of implementing\u201d targeted\ntax breaks, including the STO credit challenged here, is\n\u201csimilar to a direct expenditure of state funds.\u201d Arizona\nDept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\u2019s Tax Ex\npenditures FY 2009/10, p. 1 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010);\nsee also Surrey, Tax Incentives as a Device for Implement\ning Government Policy: A Comparison with Direct Gov\nernment Expenditures, 83 Harv.

Our prior cases have often recognized the\ncost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers gener\nally. \u201cWhen the Government grants exemptions or allows\ndeductions\u201d to some, we have observed, \u201call taxpayers are\naffected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction . . .\nmeans that other taxpayers can be said to be indirect and\n14 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nvicarious \u2018donors.\u2019 \u201d Bob Jones Univ. v.

Texas Monthly, Inc. v.\nBullock, 489 U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (plurality opinion). Indeed,\nwe have specifically compared the harm arising from a tax\nsubsidy with that arising from a cash grant, and declared\nthose injuries equivalent because both kinds of support\ndeplete the public fisc. \u201cIn either case,\u201d we stated, \u201cthe\nalleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the alleg\nedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the tax\npayer contributes.\u201d DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547\nU. S. 332, 344 (2006). This taxpayer injury of course fails\nto establish standing in the mine-run case, whatever form\nthe state aid takes. See, e.g., id., at 343\u2013344; ante, at 6\u2013\n10; supra, at 3. But the key is this: Whenever taxpayers\nhave standing under Flast to challenge an appropriation,\nthey should also have standing to contest a tax expendi\nture. Their access to the federal courts should not depend\non which type of financial subsidy the State has offered.\n   Consider some further examples of the point, but this\ntime concerning state funding of religion. Suppose a State\ndesires to reward Jews\u2014by, say, $500 per year\u2014for their\nreligious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers\u2019 con\ncern vary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their\ntax returns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend? Or\nassume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of cruci\nfixes. It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and\ndistribute them to all takers. Or it could mail a reim\nbursement check to any individual who buys her own and\nsubmits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize\nthat person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she\npaid. Now, really\u2014do taxpayers have less reason to com\nplain if the State selects the last of these three options?\nThe Court today says they do, but that is wrong. The\neffect of each form of subsidy is the same, on the public\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  15\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfisc and on those who contribute to it. Regardless of which\nmechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an identical\nstake in ensuring that the State\u2019s exercise of its taxing\nand spending power complies with the Constitution.7\n   Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar\nfor-dollar tax credit to aid school tuition organizations.\nEach year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans: Either\npay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or\nsubtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that\nsum to an STO. See Winn I, 542 U. S., at 95. To claim the\ncredit, an individual makes a notation on her tax return\nand splits her tax payment into two checks, one made out\nto the State and the other to the STO. As this Court\nrecognized in Winn I, the STO payment is therefore \u201ccost\nless\u201d to the individual, ibid.; it comes out of what she\notherwise would be legally obligated to pay the State\u2014\nhence, out of public resources. And STOs capitalize on\nthis aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth\u2014which is\nquite a lot. To drum up support, STOs highlight that\n\u201cdonations\u201d are made not with an individual\u2019s own, but\nwith other people\u2019s\u2014i.e., taxpayers\u2019\u2014money. One STO\nadvertises that \u201c[w]ith Arizona\u2019s scholarship tax credit,\nyou can send children to our community\u2019s [religious] day\nschools and it won\u2019t cost you a dime!\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 13 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omit\nted).

Stop Imagining,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The majority indicates that some persons could challenge these\n\nhypothetical government actions based on individualized injury, sepa\nrate and apart from taxpayer status. See ante, at 1\u20132, 17\u201318. That is\nquite right; indeed, some parents or children likely have standing to\nchallenge the Arizona tax credit on such grounds. But this possibility\ndoes not detract from the point made here. The purpose of these\nillustrations is to show that if taxpayer status is the thing alleged to\nconfer standing, it should do so irrespective of the form of the govern\nment subsidy.\n16 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthanks to Arizona tax laws you can!\u201d Id., at 14 (internal\nquotation marks and emphasis omitted). And so Arizo\nnans do just that: It is, after all, good fun to spend other\npeople\u2019s money. By the State\u2019s reckoning, from 1998 to\n2008 the credit cost Arizona almost $350 million in redi\nrected tax revenue.8\n  The Plaintiffs contend that this expenditure violates the\nEstablishment Clause. If the legislature had appropriated\nthese monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would have standing,\nbeyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in\nfederal court. But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse,\nthe Court today holds, because Arizona funds STOs\nthrough a tax credit rather than a cash grant. No less\nthan in the hypothetical examples offered above, here too\nform prevails over substance, and differences that make\nno difference determine access to the Judiciary. And the\ncasualty is a historic and vital method of enforcing the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutrality.\n                              C\n   The majority offers just one reason to distinguish ap\npropriations and tax expenditures: A taxpayer experiences\ninjury, the Court asserts, only when the government\n\u201cextracts and spends\u201d her very own tax dollars to aid\nreligion.

And no taxpayer can make this\nshowing, the Court concludes, if the government subsi\ndizes religion through tax credits, deductions, or exemp\ntions (rather than through appropriations).9\n   The majority purports to rely on Flast to support this\nnew \u201cextraction\u201d requirement.

Arizona\u2019s tuition\ntax-credit program in fact necessitates the direct expenditure of funds\nfrom the state treasury. After all, the statute establishing the initiative\nrequires the Arizona Department of Revenue to certify STOs, maintain\nan STO registry, make the registry available to the public on request\nand post it on a website, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send\nwritten notice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory re\nquirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a743\u20131502(A)\u2013(C), 43\u20131506 (West\nSupp. 2010). Presumably all these activities cost money, which comes\nfrom the state treasury. Thus, on the majority\u2019s own theory, the\ngovernment has \u201cextract[ed] and spen[t]\u201d the Plaintiffs\u2019 (along with\nother taxpayers\u2019) dollars to implement the challenged program, and the\nPlaintiffs should have standing. (The majority, after all, makes clear\nthat nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or proportion of the\nPlaintiffs\u2019 contribution. Ante, at 13.) But applying the majority\u2019s\ntheory in this way reveals the hollowness at its core. Can anyone\nbelieve that the Plaintiffs have suffered injury through the costs\ninvolved in administering the program, but not through the far greater\ncosts of granting the tax expenditure in the first place?\n18 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthe support of any one establishment, may force him to\nconform to any other establishment in all cases whatso\never.\u2019 \u201d 392 U.

Here is how Flast\nstated its holding: \u201c[W]e hold that a taxpayer will have\nstanding consistent with Article III to invoke federal\njudicial power when he alleges that congressional action\nunder the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\u201d\nthe Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 105\u2013106. Noth\ning in that straightforward sentence supports the idea\nthat a taxpayer can challenge only legislative action that\ndisburses his particular contribution to the state treasury.\nAnd here is how Flast primarily justified its holding:\n\u201c[O]ne of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the\nEstablishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that\nthe taxing and spending power would be used to favor one\nreligion over another or to support religion in general.\u201d\nId., at 103. That evil arises even if the specific dollars that\nthe government uses do not come from citizens who object\nto the preference. Likewise, the two-part nexus test,\nwhich is the heart of Flast\u2019s doctrinal analysis, contains no\nhint of an extraction requirement. See supra, at 4. And\nfinally, James Madison provides no comfort to today\u2019s\nmajority. He referred to \u201cthree pence\u201d exactly because it\nwas, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as\ntoday, the core injury of a religious establishment had\nnaught to do with any given individual\u2019s out-of-pocket loss.\nSee infra, at 21\u201323 (further discussing Madison\u2019s views).\nSo the majority is left with nothing, save for three words\nFlast used to describe the particular facts in that case: In\nnot a single non-trivial respect could the Flast Court\nrecognize its handiwork in the majority\u2019s depiction.\n   The injury to taxpayers that Flast perceived arose\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

In that\nand subsequent cases (including the five in this Court\ninvolving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requi\nsite harm by stating that public resources were funding\nreligion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the\nSolicitor General\u2019s \u201celectronic tag\u201d or other means) did not\nenter into the question. See DaimlerChrysler Corp., 547\nU. S., at 348 (describing how the Flast Court\u2019s under\nstanding of the Establishment Clause\u2019s history led the\nCourt to view the alleged \u201cinjury\u201d as the expenditure of\n\u201c \u2018tax money\u2019 in aid of religion\u201d (quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at\n106)). And for all the reasons already given, that standard\nis met regardless whether the funding is provided via cash\ngrant or tax expenditure. See supra, at 11\u201316. Taxpayers\npick up the cost of the subsidy in either form. See ibid. So\ntaxpayers have an interest in preventing the use of either\nmechanism to infringe religious neutrality.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 On  this traditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state\nfinancing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only Article III\u2019s\ninjury requirement, but also its causation and redressability require\nments. The majority\u2019s contrary position, ante, at 15\u201316, stems from its\nmiscasting of the injury involved; once that harm is stated correctly, all\nthe rest follows. To wit: The Plaintiffs allege they suffer injury when\nthe State funnels public resources to religious organizations through\nthe tax credit. Arizona, they claim, has caused this injury by enacting\nlegislation that establishes the credit. And an injunction limiting the\ncredit\u2019s operation would redress the harm by preventing the allegedly\nunlawful diversion of tax revenues. The Plaintiffs need not, as the\nmajority insists, show that this remedy would \u201caffect . . . their tax\npayments,\u201d ante, at 16, any more than the taxpayer in Flast had to\nestablish that her tax burden would decrease absent the Government\u2019s\nfunding of religious schools. As we have previously recognized, when\ntaxpayers object to the spending of tax money in violation of the Estab\nlishment Clause (whether through tax credits or appropriations), \u201can\ninjunction against the spending would . . . redress [their] injury, regard\nless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that\nwould benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\u201d DaimlerChrysler\nCorp. v.

Taxpayers have\nstanding in these cases despite their foreseeable failure to\nshow that the alleged constitutional violation involves\ntheir own tax dollars, not because the State has used their\nparticular funds.\n   And something still deeper is wrong with the majority\u2019s\n\u201cextract and spend\u201d requirement: It does not measure\nwhat matters under the Establishment Clause. Let us\nindulge the Court\u2019s fiction that a taxpayer\u2019s\n\u201c.000000000001 penny\u201d is somehow involved in an ordi\nnary appropriation of public funds for religious activity\n(thus supposedly distinguishing it from a tax expenditure).\nStill, consider the following example: Imagine the Internal\nRevenue Service places a checkbox on tax returns asking\nfilers if they object to the government using their taxes to\naid religion. If the government keeps \u201cyes\u201d money sepa\nrate from \u201cno\u201d money and subsidizes religious activities\nonly from the nonobjectors\u2019 account, the majority\u2019s analy\nsis suggests that no taxpayer would have standing to\nallege a violation of the Establishment Clause.

But this Court has\nnever indicated that States may insulate subsidies to\nreligious organizations from legal challenge by eliciting\nthe consent of some taxpayers. And the Court has of\ncourse been right not to take this approach. Taxpayers\nincur the same harm, and should have the same ability to\nbring suit, whether the government stores tax funds in\none bank account or two. None of the principles underly\ning the Establishment Clause suggests otherwise.\n   James Madison, whom the Court again rightly labels\n\u201cthe leading architect of the religion clauses,\u201d ante, at 13\n(quoting Flast, 392 U. S., at 103; internal quotation marks\nomitted), had something important to say about the mat\nter of \u201cextraction.\u201d As the majority notes, Madison\u2019s Me\nmorial and Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed in\nVirginia to aid teachers of the Christian religion. Ante, at\n12\u201313. But Madison\u2019s passionate opposition to that pro\nposal informs this case in a manner different than the\nmajority suggests. The Virginia tax in fact would not have\nextracted any monies (not even \u201cthree pence\u201d) from unwill\ning citizens, as the Court now requires. The plan allowed\nconscientious objectors to opt out of subsidizing religion by\ncontributing their assessment to an alternative fund for\nthe construction and maintenance of county schools.11 See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  opt-out provision described county schools as \u201cseminaries of\nlearning.\u201d A Bill for Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the\nChristian Religion, reprinted in Everson v.

Rev. 783,\n784 (2002) (the tax provision \u201cpermitted each taxpayer\nto specify which Christian denomination should re\nceive his payment\u201d and \u201c[t]hose who did not wish to sup\nport a church could direct their assessment to a pro\nposed common school fund\u201d).          Indeed, the Virginia\nAssessment was specifically \u201cdesigned to avoid any\ncharges of coercion of dissenters to pay taxes to support\nreligious teachings with which they disagreed.\u201d Feldman,\nIntellectual Origins of the Establishment Clause, 77 N.

Ante, at 13. Because the Assessment\nnever became law, no one can know which county schools would have\nreceived aid; indeed, the first of these schools did not open its doors\nuntil decades later. See W. Miller, First Liberty 26 (2003); see gener\nally J. Buck, Development of Public Schools in Virginia 1607\u20131952\n(1952). But historians and legal scholars have uniformly understood\nthe opt-out provision as a considered attempt to accommodate taxpay\ners who did not want their tax dollars to go to religion. See Berg &\nLaycock, supra, at 244, n. 113 (the \u201cprovision for payment to a school\nfund was not an effort to support religious schools as part of support for\neducation overall,\u201d but rather \u201cwas an effort to accommodate the\npossibility of non-Christian taxpayers\u201d); T. Buckley, Church and State\nin Revolutionary Virginia, 1776\u20131787, p. 133 (1977) (under the \u201ctext of\nthe proposed bill . . . nonbelievers would [not] be forced to contribute to\nreligion\u201d because \u201c[t]he assessment had been carefully drafted to permit\nthose who preferred to support education rather than religion to do so\u201d);\nsee also, e.g., Miller, supra, at 26; Underkuffler-Freund, Separation of\nthe Religious and the Secular: A Foundational Challenge to First\nAmendment Theory, 36 Wm. & Mary L.

Although both funnel tax funds to\nreligious organizations (and so saddle all taxpayers with\nthe cost), neither forces any given taxpayer to pay for the\nsubsidy out of her pocket. Madison thought that feature of\nthe Assessment insufficient to save it. By relying on the\nselfsame aspect of the Arizona scheme to deny the Plain\ntiffs\u2019 claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison\u2019s vision.\n                             III\n   Today\u2019s decision devastates taxpayer standing in Estab\nlishment Clause cases. The government, after all, often\nuses tax expenditures to subsidize favored persons and\nactivities. Still more, the government almost always has\nthis option. Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily\ninterchangeable; what is a cash grant today can be a tax\nbreak tomorrow. The Court\u2019s opinion thus offers a road\nmap\u2014more truly, just a one-step instruction\u2014to any\ngovernment that wishes to insulate its financing of reli\ngious activity from legal challenge. Structure the funding\nas a tax expenditure, and Flast will not stand in the way.\nNo taxpayer will have standing to object. However bla\ntantly the government may violate the Establishment\nClause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal courts.\n   And by ravaging Flast in this way, today\u2019s decision\ndamages one of this Nation\u2019s defining constitutional com\nmitments. \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion\u201d\u2014ten simple words that have\nstood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of American\nreligious liberty. Ten words that this Court has long\nunderstood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(1995); Adams & Emmerich, Heritage of Religious Liberty, 137 U. Pa. \n\nL. Rev. 1559, 1573 (1989); Laycock, \u201cNonpreferential\u201d Aid to Religion: A\nFalse Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 897,\nand n. 108 (1985\u20131986); L. Pfeffer, Church State and Freedom 110 (rev.\ned. 1967).\n24 ARIZONA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TUITION ORGANIZATION v.\n                         WINN\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmeans eliminate) the government\u2019s power to finance reli\ngious activity. The Court\u2019s ruling today will not shield all\nstate subsidies for religion from review; as the Court\nnotes, some persons alleging Establishment Clause viola\ntions have suffered individualized injuries, and therefore\nhave standing, independent of their taxpayer status. See\nante, at 1\u20132, 17\u201318. But Flast arose because \u201cthe taxing\nand spending power [may] be used to favor one religion\nover another or to support religion in general,\u201d 392 U. S.,\nat 103, without causing particularized harm to discrete\npersons. It arose because state sponsorship of religion\nsometimes harms individuals only (but this \u201conly\u201d is no\nsmall matter) in their capacity as contributing members of\nour national community. In those cases, the Flast Court\nthought, our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious neutral\nity still should be enforced.\n   Because that judgment was right then, and remains\nright today, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
