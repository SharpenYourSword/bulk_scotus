Decided April 18, 2011 \n\n\n   The motion of petitioners for leave to file a supplemental\nbrief under seal is granted. The petition for a writ of\ncertiorari is denied. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this motion and this petition.\n   Statement of JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE\nKENNEDY, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\njoin, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of\ncertiorari.\n   Petitioners have been held for several years in custody\nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014a detention that the Govern\nment agrees was without lawful cause. Brief in Opposi\ntion 2. They seek a judicial order that would require their\nrelease from custody into the United States. The District\nCourt concluded that the law entitled petitioners to such\nan order. In re Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation, 581\nF. Supp. 2d 33 (DC 2008). The Court of Appeals held to\nthe contrary. Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC\n2009).

Obama, 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n   The Court subsequently learned that each of the re\nmaining petitioners had received and rejected at least two\noffers of resettlement. In light of these changed circum\nstances, the Court vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\n2                    KIYEMBA v.

Obama, 559 U. S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1\u20132). The\nCourt of Appeals found that no further proceedings were\nnecessary and reinstated its prior opinion as modified.\n605 F. 3d 1046 (CADC 2010) (per curiam). Petitioners\nhave asked this Court to review the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision.\n   Judge Rogers, separately concurring in the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment on remand, pointed out that petitioners\nhave \u201creceived two offers of resettlement in countries\n[including Palau, which] the United States determined\n\u2018appropriate.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1050, n. 3. She added that petition\ners have \u201cneither allege[d] nor proffer[ed]\u201d any evidence\nthat accepting these offers would have threatened them\nwith a risk of \u201ctorture\u201d or any \u201cother harm,\u201d the need to\navoid which might provide reason to believe the offers are\nnot appropriate. Id., at 1050. At the same time, the Gov\nernment tells us that \u201cif petitioners were to express inter\nest, the United States would again discuss the matter with\nthe government of Palau [and that it] continues to work to\nfind other options for resettlement.\u201d Brief in Opposition\n13, n. 7.\n   In my view, these offers, the lack of any meaningful\nchallenge as to their appropriateness, and the Govern\nment\u2019s uncontested commitment to continue to work to\nresettle petitioners transform petitioners\u2019 claim. Under\npresent circumstances, I see no Government-imposed\nobstacle to petitioners\u2019 timely release and appropriate\nresettlement. Accordingly, I join in the Court\u2019s denial of\ncertiorari. Should circumstances materially change, how\never, petitioners may of course raise their original issue (or\nrelated issues) again in the lower courts and in this Court.\n",
