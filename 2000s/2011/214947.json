Obama, 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n   The Court subsequently learned that each of the re\nmaining petitioners had received and rejected at least two\noffers of resettlement.

She added that petition\ners have “neither allege[d] nor proffer[ed]” any evidence\nthat accepting these offers would have threatened them\nwith a risk of “torture” or any “other harm,” the need to\navoid which might provide reason to believe the offers are\nnot appropriate. Id., at 1050.
