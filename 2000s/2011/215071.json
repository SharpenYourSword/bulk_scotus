STEWART, COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA \r\n\r\n      DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH\r\n\r\n      AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n    No. 09\u2013529.      Argued December 1, 2010\u2014Decided April 19, 2011\r\nTogether, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights\r\n  Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\r\n  with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to\r\n  improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis\r\n  abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es\r\n  tablish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system \u201cto protect and advo\r\n  cate [those individuals\u2019] rights.\u201d      42 U. S. C. \u00a715043(a)(1).     A\r\n  participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private\r\n  nonprofit entity as its P&A system, but if a state agency it must have\r\n  authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen\r\n  cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,\r\n  petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au\r\n  thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals\u2019 rights, free of\r\n  executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia\u2019s at\r\n  torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.\r\n    While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental\r\n  hospitals, VOPA asked respondents\u2014state officials in charge of those\r\n  hospitals\u2014to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,\r\n  asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo\r\n  sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec\r\n  laration that respondents\u2019 refusal to produce the records violated the\r\n  DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro\r\n  duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with\r\n  VOPA\u2019s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground\r\n2       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                             Syllabus\r\n\r\n    that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but\r\n    the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\n    Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\n    prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.\r\n    The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap\r\n    ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.\r\nHeld: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro\r\n spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the\r\n same State. Pp. 4\u201313.\r\n    (a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a\r\n valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri\r\n vate person\u2019s suit against a State. Pp. 4\u20135.\r\n    (b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important\r\n limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces\r\n sary to \u201cpermit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.\u201d Penn\r\n hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests\r\n on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to\r\n do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the\r\n State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply \u201cwhen \u2018the\r\n state is the . . . party in interest.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 101. Pp. 5\u20136.\r\n    (c) Entertaining VOPA\u2019s action is consistent with precedent and\r\n does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im\r\n munity. Pp. 6\u201313.\r\n       (1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S.\r\n 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine\u2019s applica\r\n bility, \u201ca court need only conduct a \u2018straightforward inquiry into\r\n whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\r\n and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 645.\r\n VOPA\u2019s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac\r\n tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a\r\n state agency. The \u201cgeneral criterion for determining when a suit is in\r\n fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,\u201d Penn\r\n hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap\r\n plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.\r\n 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young\r\n to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would \u201cextinguish\r\n [Idaho\u2019s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte\r\n gral part of its territory.\u201d Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no\r\n argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of\r\n Virginia\u2019s sovereignty. Pp. 7\u20139.\r\n       (2) Respondents claim that a State\u2019s dignity is diminished when\r\n a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a\r\n State\u2019s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own\r\n agency sues to enforce its officers\u2019 compliance with federal law than\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA\u2019s power to sue state\r\n  officials is a consequence of Virginia\u2019s own decision to establish a\r\n  public P&A system. Not every offense to a State\u2019s dignity constitutes\r\n  a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which\r\n  sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled\r\n  into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit\r\n  happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9\u201311.\r\n       (3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence\r\n  of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\n  exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses\r\n  against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce\r\n  that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi\r\n  tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the\r\n  Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.\r\n  Pp. 12\u201313.\r\n568 F. 3d 110, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\r\nTHOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

S. 123\r\n(1908), allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospec\r\ntive relief against state officials brought by another agency\r\nof the same State.\r\n                             I\r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of\r\nRights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 114 Stat. 1677, 42 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a715001 et seq., offers States federal money to improve\r\ncommunity services, such as medical care and job train\r\ning, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See\r\n\u00a7\u00a715023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State\r\nmust establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system\r\n\u201cto protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\r\ndevelopmental disabilities.\u201d \u00a715043(a)(1). The P&A sys\r\ntem receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.\r\n\u00a715042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act\r\n(PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U. S. C. \u00a710801 et seq.,\r\nincreases that separate funding and extends the mission\r\nof P&A systems to include the mentally ill. \u00a7\u00a710802(2),\r\n10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under\r\nthese statutes.\r\n   Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&A system must\r\nhave certain powers. The system \u201cshall . . . have the\r\nauthority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .\r\nif the incidents are reported to the system or if there is\r\nprobable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\u201d\r\n\u00a715043(a)(2)(B); \u00a710805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu\r\ntory requirements, it must be given access to \u201call records\u201d\r\nof individuals who may have been abused, see\r\n\u00a715043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); \u00a710805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as\r\n\u201cother records that are relevant to conducting an investi\r\ngation,\u201d \u00a715043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a\r\nP&A system have authority to \u201cpursue legal, administra\r\ntive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to\r\nensure the protection of\u201d its charges. \u00a715043(a)(2)(A)(i);\r\nsee \u00a710805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own\r\nrights, a P&A system may \u201cpursue administrative, legal,\r\nand other remedies on behalf of\u201d those it protects.\r\n\u00a710805(a)(1)(C); see \u00a715044(b).\r\n   A participating State is free to appoint either a state\r\nagency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system.\r\n\u00a715044(a); \u00a710805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig\r\nnated entity must have certain structural features that\r\nensure its independence from the State\u2019s government. The\r\nDD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than\r\none-third of the members of the system\u2019s governing board,\r\n\u00a715044(a)(2), and restricts the State\u2019s ability to impose\r\nhiring freezes or other measures that would impair the\r\nsystem\u2019s ability to carry out its mission, \u00a715043(a)(2)(K).\r\nOnce a State designates an entity as its P&A system, it\r\nmay not change its selection without \u201cgood cause.\u201d\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\u00a715043(a)(4)(A).\r\n   Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated\r\na government entity as their P&A system. The Virginia\r\nOffice for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an \u201cinde\r\npendent state agency.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a751.5\u201339.2(A)\r\n(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven \u201cnonlegislative\r\ncitizen members,\u201d of whom only three are appointed by\r\nthe Governor. \u00a751.5\u201339.2(B). The remaining eight are\r\nappointed by components of the legislature: five by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen\r\nate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates\r\ncandidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the\r\nappointing officials that they \u201cshall seriously consider the\r\npersons nominated and appoint such persons whenever\r\nfeasible.\u201d Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and\r\nare removable only by a court and only for specified rea\r\nsons. See \u00a751.5\u201339.2(C) and (F); \u00a724.2\u2013233 and 234 (Lexis\r\n2006).\r\n   VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive\r\nbranch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor\r\nney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who\r\nare statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA\u2019s behalf. \u00a751.5\u2013\r\n39.2(A); \u00a72.2\u2013510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe\r\ncifically empowers VOPA to \u201cinitiate any proceedings to\r\nsecure the rights\u201d of disabled individuals. \u00a751.5\u201339.2(A).\r\n                             B\r\n   In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths\r\nof two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental\r\nhospitals. It asked respondents\u2014state officials in charge\r\nof those institutions\u2014to produce any records related to\r\nrisk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the\r\nhospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents\r\nrefused, asserting that the records were protected by a\r\nstate-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi\r\nals from disclosure.\r\n4       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  VOPA then brought this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging\r\nthat the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review\r\nrecords, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that\r\nmight apply. It sought a declaration that respondents\u2019\r\nrefusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI\r\nActs, along with an injunction requiring respondents to\r\nprovide access to the records and refrain in the future\r\nfrom interfering with VOPA\u2019s right of access to them.\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds\r\nthat they are immune from suit under the Eleventh\r\nAmendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its\r\nview, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\nYoung, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\nprospective relief against state officials for violations of\r\nfederal law. Virginia v. Reinhard, 2008 WL 2795940, *6\r\n(ED Va., July 18, 2008).\r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed. Virginia v. Reinhard,\r\n568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA\u2019s lawsuit to be\r\nan \u201cintramural contest\u201d that \u201cencroaches more severely on\r\nthe dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte\r\nYoung action brought by a private plaintiff,\u201d the Court of\r\nAppeals concluded it was not authorized by that case. Id.,\r\nat 119\u2013120 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n  We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ____ (2010).\r\n                            II \r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  Sovereign immunity is the privilege of the sovereign not\r\nto be sued without its consent. The language of the Elev\r\nenth Amendment1 only eliminates the basis for our judg\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    1 The\r\n        Eleventh Amendment reads as follows:\r\n  \u201cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\r\nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\r\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or\r\nSubjects of any Foreign State.\u201d\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Georgia, 2 Dall.\r\n419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a\r\nnoncitizen of the State. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134\r\nU. S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh\r\nAmendment to confirm the structural understanding that\r\nStates entered the Union with their sovereign immunity\r\nintact, unlimited by Article III\u2019s jurisdictional grant.\r\nBlatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779\r\n(1991); see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal\r\nderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). Our cases hold that the\r\nStates have retained their traditional immunity from suit,\r\n\u201cexcept as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain\r\nconstitutional amendments.\u201d Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.\r\n706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu\r\nnity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre\r\npaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675\u2013\r\n676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may\r\nabrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver\r\nor valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a\r\nprivate person\u2019s suit against a State.\r\n                             B\r\n  In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an\r\nimportant limit on the sovereign-immunity principle.\r\nThat case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reduc\r\ning the freight rates that railroads could charge. A rail\r\nroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were un\r\nconstitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal\r\ninjunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of\r\nMinnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to en\r\nforce the state law. Perkins v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 155\r\nF. 445 (CC Minn. 1907). When Young violated the injunc\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  2 We  have recognized that Congress may abrogate a State\u2019s immunity\r\nwhen it acts under \u00a75 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Seminole Tribe of\r\nFla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996), but not when it acts under its\r\noriginal Article I authority to regulate commerce, id., at 65\u201366.\r\n6    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the\r\nCircuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to\r\nfederal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this\r\nCourt, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that\r\nMinnesota\u2019s sovereign immunity deprived the federal\r\ncourt of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his\r\nofficial duties.\r\n   We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti\r\ntutional legislative enactment is \u201cvoid,\u201d a state official who\r\nenforces that law \u201ccomes into conflict with the superior\r\nauthority of [the] Constitution,\u201d and therefore is \u201cstripped\r\nof his official or representative character and is subjected\r\nin his person to the consequences of his individual con\r\nduct.

It rests on\r\nthe premise\u2014less delicately called a \u201cfiction,\u201d id., at 114,\r\nn. 25\u2014that when a federal court commands a state official\r\nto do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,\r\nhe is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes.

Although we\r\nhave never encountered such a suit before, we are satis\r\nfied that entertaining VOPA\u2019s action is consistent with our\r\nprecedents and does not offend the distinctive interests\r\nprotected by sovereign immunity.\r\n                             1\r\n   In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535\r\nU. S. 635 (2002), we held that \u201c[i]n determining whether\r\nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend\r\nment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a \u2018straightfor\r\nward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\r\ncharacterized as prospective.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 645 (quoting Idaho\r\nv. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)\r\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\r\nment)). There is no doubt VOPA\u2019s suit satisfies that\r\nstraightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents\u2019\r\nrefusal to produce the requested medical records violates\r\nfederal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro\r\nduction of the records, which would prospectively abate\r\nthe alleged violation. Respondents concede that were\r\nVOPA a private organization rather than a state agency,\r\nthe doctrine would permit this action to proceed.3\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 The dissent is mistaken when it claims that applying the Verizon\r\nMaryland test would mean two of our cases were \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d\r\nPost, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). We discuss the first of those\r\ncases, Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, below. Infra, at 8. As for the second,\r\nSeminole Tribe, supra, it is inapposite. The reason we refused to\r\npermit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula\r\ntory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under\r\nmined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had\r\nforeclosed recourse to the doctrine. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73\u2013\r\n76.\r\n    Respondents now argue\u2014for the first time in this litigation\u2014that\r\nthe DD and PAIMI Acts have the same effect here. We reject that\r\nsuggestion.

Although\r\nrespondents argue that VOPA\u2019s status as a state agency\r\nchanges the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for\r\nmaking the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on\r\nthe identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been\r\nwilling to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to\r\nevade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise \u201cwould be\r\nto adhere to an empty formalism.\u201d Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe,\r\nsupra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized\r\nreflect the principle that the \u201cgeneral criterion for deter\r\nmining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the\r\neffect of the relief sought,\u201d Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not\r\nwho is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, Ex parte Young cannot\r\nbe used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of\r\nfunds from the State\u2019s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,\r\n415 U. S. 651, 666 (1974); or an order for specific perform\r\nance of a State\u2019s contract, see id., at 666\u2013667; In re Ayers,\r\n123 U. S. 443 (1887).\r\n   Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely,\r\nis an application of this principle. There we refused to\r\nallow an Indian Tribe to use Ex parte Young to obtain\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive\r\nright to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands\r\nin Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regu\r\nlations governing that land. 521 U.

Indeed, they concede that the very\r\ninjunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a\r\nfederal court at the instance of a private P&A system.\r\n                               2\r\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining\r\nVOPA\u2019s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless\r\ninfringe Virginia\u2019s sovereign interests because it dimin\r\nishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate\r\na dispute between its components. See Brief for Respon\r\ndents 23\u201326; post, at 4\u20138 (arguing that \u201c \u2018special sover\r\neignty interests\u2019 \u201d bar VOPA\u2019s lawsuit (quoting Coeur\r\nd\u2019Alene Tribe, supra, at 281)). We disagree. As an initial\r\nmatter, we do not understand how a State\u2019s stature could\r\nbe diminished to any greater degree when its own agency\r\npolices its officers\u2019 compliance with their federal obliga\r\ntions, than when a private person hales those officers into\r\nfederal court for that same purpose\u2014something everyone\r\nagrees is proper.4 And in this case, of course, VOPA\u2019s\r\npower to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia\u2019s\r\nown decision to establish a public, rather than a private,\r\nP&A system. We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amend\r\nment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by\r\noperation of its own laws, VOPA is admitted to federal\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  4 The dissent compares VOPA\u2019s lawsuit to such indignities as \u201ccanni\r\n\r\nbalism\u201d and \u201cpatricide,\u201d since it is a greater \u201caffront to someone\u2019s\r\ndignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger.\u201d Post, at\r\n9. We think the dissent\u2019s principle of familial affront less than univer\r\nsally applicable, even with respect to real families, never mind govern\r\nmental siblings. Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testa\r\nmentary disposition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.\r\nAnd confining one\u2019s child to his room is called grounding, while confin\r\ning a stranger\u2019s child is called kidnaping. Jurisdiction over this case\r\ndoes not depend on which is the most apt comparison.\r\n10    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v.

The\r\nspecific indignity against which sovereign immunity pro\r\ntects is the insult to a State of being haled into court\r\nwithout its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases\r\nreasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the\r\nsuit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state\r\ntreasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just\r\nbecause the suit happens to be brought by another state\r\nagency. Respondents\u2019 asserted dignitary harm is simply\r\nunconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.\r\n  The dissent complains that applying Ex parte Young to\r\nthis lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the op\r\nposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.\r\nPost, at 7. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of\r\nletting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have\r\nnothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity\u2014\r\nwhether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather\r\nthan against its officers. But it is not a consequence of the\r\nfederal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if\r\nthe federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dis\r\nsent would require.

That would be true if we were\r\nrelying on the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. We are\r\nnot. We rely upon Ex parte Young. We say that Virginia has only itself\r\nto blame for the position in which it finds itself, not because it con\r\nsented to suit, but because it created a state entity to sue, instead of\r\nleaving the task to a private entity. It did not have to know that this\r\nwould allow suit in federal court. Know or not know, Ex parte Young\r\nproduces that result.\r\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Nor would sending\r\nthe matter to state court even avoid the prospect that \u201ca\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail,\u201d ibid., since the state-court loser could\r\nalways ask this Court to review the matter by certiorari.\r\n(Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of\r\nsovereign immunity? But see Cohens v. Virginia, 6\r\nWheat. 264 (1821).)6 And of course precisely the same\r\nthing would happen if respondents specifically waived\r\ntheir sovereign-immunity objections in this very case. Yet\r\nno one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign\r\nimmunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of\r\nEx parte Young, there has been no violation of sovereign\r\nimmunity, the prospect of a federal judge\u2019s resolving\r\nVOPA\u2019s dispute with respondents does not make it so.\r\n   We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the\r\nFederal Government\u2019s power to affect the internal opera\r\ntions of a State. See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521\r\nU. S. 898 (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state\r\nofficers); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 579 (1911) (Con\r\ngress may not dictate a State\u2019s capital). But those limits\r\nmust be found in some textual provision or structural\r\npremise of the Constitution. Additional limits cannot be\r\nsmuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a\r\nsuit in federal court that does not violate the State\u2019s sov\r\nereign immunity. 7\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 The dissent agrees that because of the \u201c \u2018constitutional plan,\u2019 \u201d post,\r\n\r\nat 8, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages\r\nand Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990),\r\nthis Court can adjudicate disputes between state agencies without\r\noffending sovereign immunity. But explaining away exceptions to its\r\ntheory does not advance the ball. It has not demonstrated that sover\r\neign immunity has anything at all to say about federal courts\u2019 adjudi\r\ncating interagency disputes.\r\n  7 We have no occasion to pass on other questions of federalism lurk\r\n\r\ning in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper\r\n12    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              3\r\n  A weightier objection, perhaps, is the relative novelty of\r\nthis lawsuit. Respondents rightly observe that federal\r\ncourts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by\r\nstate agencies against other state officials. That does give\r\nus pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a\r\nconstitutional infirmity, see, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ____,\r\n____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity\r\ndecisions have traditionally warned against \u201c \u2018anomalous\r\nand unheard-of proceedings or suits,\u2019 \u201d Alden, 527 U. S., at\r\n727 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 18).\r\n  Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past con\r\nstitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is\r\nthe case here. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\nexception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two\r\nthings: first, a federal right that it possesses against its\r\nparent State; and second, authority to sue other state\r\nofficials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto\r\nwielded by the state government. These conditions will\r\nrarely coincide\u2014and at least the latter of them cannot\r\nexist without the consent of the State that created the\r\nagency and defined its powers.            See post, at 3\u20134\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). We are unaware that the\r\nnecessary conditions have ever presented themselves\r\nexcept in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the\r\nparties have referred us to no examples.8 Thus, the ap\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nexercise of Congress\u2019s enumerated powers.

Neverthe\r\nless, retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh\r\nAmendment\u201d). And Pennhurst declined to extend Young\r\nto suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need\r\nto ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justi\r\nfication for restricting state sovereignty. 465 U.

As a result, Verizon Md.\r\nincorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to\r\nreject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved\r\nthe same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense\r\nthat was at issue in Young.

In the posture\r\nof the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as\r\nsumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it\r\nseeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the\r\nSupremacy Clause.

But the affront to the State\u2019s dignity is\r\ndiminished to some extent when it is noted that if the\r\nState had elected the alternate course of designating a\r\nprivate protection and advocacy system it then would have\r\navoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat\r\ning in the federal program. The availability of that alter\r\nnate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of\r\nthe validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only\r\nquestion here is the reach of the Young exception.\r\n   Virginia\u2019s concern that the holding here upsets the\r\nfederal balance is further mitigated by the various protec\r\ntions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure\r\nthat state officials do not too often call upon the federal\r\ncourts to resolve their intramural disputes.\r\n   First, and most important, state law must authorize an\r\nagency or official to sue another arm of the State. If\r\nStates do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in\r\nfederal court, they need not empower their officers or\r\nagencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if\r\nstate officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they\r\nmay invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal\r\ncapacities.\r\n   Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state\r\nlaw as to an officer\u2019s or agency\u2019s power to sue, or any other\r\nstate-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts\r\nshould abstain under Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Pullman\r\nCo., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor\r\ntance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial\r\nintervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is\r\nnecessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve\r\na dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution\r\nof the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.\r\nLikewise, certification of questions of state law to the state\r\ncourts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con\r\n4    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\ntroversy. Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391\r\n(1974) (Certification \u201chelps build a cooperative judicial\r\nfederalism\u201d).\r\n   Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state\r\nofficials or agencies to assert against other arms of the\r\nState. True, officials may assert that their personal fed\r\neral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam\r\nple where the State engages in discriminatory employ\r\nment practices. But the statutory framework in the case\r\nnow before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state\r\nagency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat\r\nutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers\r\nor agencies, and the Constitution\u2019s rights-creating Clauses\r\nprotect persons rather than officers. Because the Young\r\nexception is available only to those who assert federal\r\nviolations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern\r\nment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar\r\nrow one.\r\n   All this is simply to underscore that the program at\r\nissue may present constitutional questions but that the\r\nparties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does\r\nnot argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend\r\ning power under Article I, \u00a78 by forcing a state that wishes\r\nto designate a public agency as its advocacy system to\r\nallow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring\r\nthat the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42\r\nU. S. C. \u00a715043(a)(2)(G) (system must \u201cbe independent of\r\nany agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita\r\ntion to individuals with developmental disabilities\u201d);\r\n\u00a715044(a)(2) (\u201c[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the\r\ngoverning board may be appointed by the chief executive\r\nofficer of the State\u201d). Young\u2014a court-made doctrine based\r\non convenience, fiction, or both\u2014neither implicates nor\r\nsubsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the\r\nexcessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be\r\nmost cautious before deciding cases that might later lead\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming, as the Court\r\nmust, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow\r\nquestion is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the\r\nsovereign immunity bar.\r\n  One might doubt whether the constitutional question\r\nmay be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court\r\nwields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to\r\nvindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court\r\nshould not extend the fiction in the name of claims that\r\nmay rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is\r\nmisplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs\r\ncourts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre\r\nserves its validity, but the specter of a statute\u2019s unconsti\r\ntutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent\r\nquestion of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a\r\nstatute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate\r\nthe case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal\r\nright for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect\r\nto invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court\r\nshould not permit the commission of acts that violate a\r\nfederal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted\r\nbeyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed\r\nto vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious\r\naffront to state sovereignty in light of the options available\r\nto the State under the program, it may proceed.\r\n  With these observations, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

We have, for example, held that the fiction of\r\nEx parte Young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff\r\nseeks retroactive relief, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,\r\n678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on\r\nstate law, Pennhurst, supra, at 106; where the federal law\r\nviolation is no longer \u201congoing,\u201d Green v.

After deciding\r\nthe plaintiffs \u201cclearly satisfie[d]\u201d the \u201cstraightforward\r\ninquiry,\u201d the Court went on to examine whether Congress\r\nhad created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in\r\nSeminole Tribe. 535 U. S., at 645, 647\u2013648 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Only after determining that\r\nCongress had not done so did the Court conclude that the\r\nsuit could go forward under Ex parte Young.\r\n  If Verizon\u2019s formulation set forth the only requirements\r\nfor bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our\r\nrecent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole\r\nTribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often \u201cfound\r\nfederal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when\r\nthat suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order\r\nto end a continuing violation of federal law.\u201d 517 U. S., at\r\n73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,\r\nhowever, that the \u201csituation presented\u201d there was \u201csuffi\r\nciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action so as to preclude the availability of\r\nthat doctrine.\u201d Ibid.2\r\n  In Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an\r\n\u201callegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the\r\nrequested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to\r\ninvoke the Young fiction.\u201d 521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis\r\nadded). The Court held, however, that the action could\r\nnot proceed under Ex parte Young because it implicated\r\n\u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d\u2014in that case, the State\u2019s\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  2 While I agree that in Seminole Tribe \u201cwe refused to permit suit to\r\n\r\nproceed\u201d under Ex parte Young because Congress \u201chad foreclosed\r\nrecourse to the doctrine,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 3, that simply confirms my point\r\nthat the availability of Young depends on more than just whether\r\nVerizon\u2019s prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, Seminole Tribe\r\nmakes clear that a plaintiff who files a \u201ccomplaint alleg[ing] an ongoing\r\nviolation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as\r\nprospective,\u201d Verizon, 535 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under\r\nYoung.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The real interests served by the Eleventh\r\n    Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me\r\n    chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the\r\n    Young exception must reflect a proper understanding\r\n    of its role in our federal system and respect for state\r\n    courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic\r\n    tion.\u201d 521 U.

If this were a \u201ctraditional Ex\r\nparte Young action,\u201d Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti\r\ntioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under\r\nthat case.

The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov\r\nernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.\r\nHere extending Young forces the State to defend itself\r\nagainst itself in federal court.\r\n  Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title\r\nof \u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d in its complaint, App.\r\n10; respondents are state officials acting in an official\r\ncapacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one\r\nthing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the\r\nCommonwealth will lose. Because of today\u2019s holding, a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail.\r\n  Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal\r\ncourt; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that\r\nthis intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.\r\nThis is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to\r\nguard against. See ante, at 10 (\u201cThe specific indignity\r\nagainst which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to\r\na State of being haled into court without its consent\u201d).\r\nThat indignity is compounded when the State is haled into\r\nfederal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal\r\nstate dispute.\r\n  The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no\r\nsovereign interest in determining where such disputes will\r\nbe resolved.

In each of those hy\r\npotheticals, the State consented to having a particular\r\nforum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.3\r\n   In sum, the \u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d implicated\r\nhere make this case \u201csufficiently different from that giving\r\nrise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to pre\r\nclude the availability of that doctrine.\u201d Seminole Tribe,\r\n517 U. S., at 73. I would cling to reality and not extend\r\nthe fiction of Ex parte Young to cover petitioner\u2019s suit.\r\n                             II\r\n   The Court offers several justifications for its expansion\r\nof Ex parte Young. None is persuasive.\r\n   The Court first contends that whether the Ex parte\r\nYoung fiction should be applied turns only on the \u201crelief\r\nsought\u201d in a case. Ante, at 8\u20139 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior\r\ncases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.\r\nSee, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664\u2013671. That may well\r\nbe because \u201cthe difference between the type of relief\r\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this\r\n\r\nCourt from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it\r\nhad been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that \u201cit is\r\ninherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes\r\ncognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court\r\nof the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to\r\nthe original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.\u201d McKes\r\nson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of\r\nBusiness Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted). By contrast, there is nothing \u201cinherent in the\r\nconstitutional plan\u201d that warrants lower federal courts handling\r\nintrastate disputes absent a State\u2019s consent.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nunder Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that\r\nbetween day and night.\u201d Id., at 667. But the Court is\r\nwrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and\r\ncategorically conclude that there can be no other basis for\r\ndetermining whether to extend Ex parte Young\u2019s fiction.\r\n   The thrust of the Court\u2019s argument appears to be that,\r\nbecause the relief sought here is no different from that\r\nwhich could be sought in a suit by a private protection and\r\nadvocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should\r\nalso apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7\u2013\r\n9. But private entities are different from public ones:\r\nThey are private. When private litigants are involved, the\r\nState is not turned against itself.\r\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there\r\nis indeed a real difference between a suit against the State\r\nbrought by a private party and one brought by a state\r\nagency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal\r\nism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate\r\nresults may be the same\u2014a full stomach and a dead\r\nbody\u2014it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.\r\nI would think it more an affront to someone\u2019s dignity to be\r\nsued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While\r\nneither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would\r\nbe equally received.\r\n   The Court also contends that petitioner\u2019s ability to sue\r\nstate officials in federal court \u201cis a consequence of Vir\r\nginia\u2019s own decision to establish a public [protection and\r\nadvocacy] system.\u201d Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia\r\nhas consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That\r\nargument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek\r\ncertiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565\r\nF. 3d 110, 116\u2013118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.\r\n   Instead the Court claims that \u201cVirginia has only itself to\r\nblame\u201d\u2014if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it\r\ncould have chosen to establish a private entity instead.\r\nAnte, at 9\u201310, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\n10   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nconcurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect\r\nthat an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from\r\nchallenge simply because a constitutional alternative is\r\navailable. And here the public and private systems are\r\nnot interchangeable alternatives in any event.\r\n   The Court\u2019s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes\r\nVirginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte\r\nYoung applies to this arrangement\u2014that for the first time\r\nin history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in\r\nfederal court\u2014can the Court suggest that Virginia know\r\ningly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.\r\n   In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir\r\nginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent\r\nlitigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same\r\n\u201cas any other litigant.\u201d Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not\r\nlike any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys\r\nsome independence from the State\u2019s executive branch, that\r\ndoes not mean petitioner is independent from the State.\r\nAs noted, petitioner certainly views itself as \u201cThe Com\r\nmonwealth of Virginia,\u201d App. 10, and would presumably\r\ninvoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of\r\nsovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how\r\na State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among\r\ndifferent state agencies or officials.\r\n   The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because\r\npetitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it\r\nmay sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13\r\n(\u201cthe Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\u201d since it\r\n\u201cwas Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the\r\npower to sue state officials\u201d). There is more to this case\r\nthan merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the\r\nAttorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions\r\ncited by the Court say nothing about actions against the\r\nState in federal court.\r\n   If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthen scores of state entities now \u201csuddenly possess the\r\nauthority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other\r\nstate officials\u201d in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.\r\nThere would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to\r\nsuch suits. Given the number of state agencies across the\r\ncountry that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,\r\ne.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11\u2013\r\n13, the Court\u2019s decision today could potentially lead to all\r\nsorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal\r\nstate government disputes.\r\n   And there is also no reason to think that the Court\u2019s\r\nholding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to\r\nthe Court\u2019s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some\r\nlevel of independence could as a matter of federal law\r\nbring suit against other state officials in federal court.\r\nDisputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet\r\nrooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  No one questions the continued vitality or importance of\r\nthe doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte\r\nYoung was about affording relief to a private party against\r\nunconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving\r\na dispute between two different state actors. That is a\r\nmatter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.\r\n  Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419\r\n(1793)\u2014permitting States to be sued by private parties in\r\nfederal court\u2014\u201ccreated such a shock of surprise\u201d through\r\nout the country \u201cthat the Eleventh Amendment was at\r\nonce proposed and adopted.\u201d Principality of Monaco v.\r\nMississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934). It is fair to say that\r\ntoday\u2019s decision will probably not trigger a similar re\r\nsponse. But however much their practical functions and\r\nprominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the\r\nStates remain a vital element of our political structure.\r\nSovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature\r\n12   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v.

The fiction of Ex parte\r\nYoung should not be extended to permit so real an\r\nintrusion.\r\n   Because I believe the Court\u2019s novel expansion of Ex\r\nparte Young is inconsistent with the federal system estab\r\nlished by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.\r\n",

Argued December 1, 2010\u2014Decided April 19, 2011\r\nTogether, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights\r\n  Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\r\n  with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to\r\n  improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis\r\n  abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es\r\n  tablish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system \u201cto protect and advo\r\n  cate [those individuals\u2019] rights.\u201d      42 U. S. C. \u00a715043(a)(1).     A\r\n  participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private\r\n  nonprofit entity as its P&A system, but if a state agency it must have\r\n  authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen\r\n  cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,\r\n  petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au\r\n  thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals\u2019 rights, free of\r\n  executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia\u2019s at\r\n  torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.\r\n    While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental\r\n  hospitals, VOPA asked respondents\u2014state officials in charge of those\r\n  hospitals\u2014to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,\r\n  asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo\r\n  sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec\r\n  laration that respondents\u2019 refusal to produce the records violated the\r\n  DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro\r\n  duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with\r\n  VOPA\u2019s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground\r\n2       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                             Syllabus\r\n\r\n    that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but\r\n    the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\n    Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\n    prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.\r\n    The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap\r\n    ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.\r\nHeld: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro\r\n spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the\r\n same State. Pp. 4\u201313.\r\n    (a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a\r\n valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri\r\n vate person\u2019s suit against a State. Pp. 4\u20135.\r\n    (b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important\r\n limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces\r\n sary to \u201cpermit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.\u201d Penn\r\n hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests\r\n on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to\r\n do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the\r\n State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply \u201cwhen \u2018the\r\n state is the . . . party in interest.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 101. Pp. 5\u20136.\r\n    (c) Entertaining VOPA\u2019s action is consistent with precedent and\r\n does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im\r\n munity. Pp. 6\u201313.\r\n       (1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S.\r\n 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine\u2019s applica\r\n bility, \u201ca court need only conduct a \u2018straightforward inquiry into\r\n whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\r\n and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 645.\r\n VOPA\u2019s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac\r\n tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a\r\n state agency. The \u201cgeneral criterion for determining when a suit is in\r\n fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,\u201d Penn\r\n hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap\r\n plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.\r\n 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young\r\n to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would \u201cextinguish\r\n [Idaho\u2019s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte\r\n gral part of its territory.\u201d Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no\r\n argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of\r\n Virginia\u2019s sovereignty. Pp. 7\u20139.\r\n       (2) Respondents claim that a State\u2019s dignity is diminished when\r\n a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a\r\n State\u2019s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own\r\n agency sues to enforce its officers\u2019 compliance with federal law than\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Moreover, VOPA\u2019s power to sue state\r\n  officials is a consequence of Virginia\u2019s own decision to establish a\r\n  public P&A system. Not every offense to a State\u2019s dignity constitutes\r\n  a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which\r\n  sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled\r\n  into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit\r\n  happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9\u201311.\r\n       (3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence\r\n  of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\n  exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses\r\n  against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce\r\n  that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi\r\n  tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the\r\n  Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.\r\n  Pp. 12\u201313.\r\n568 F. 3d 110, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\r\nTHOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

S. C.\r\n\u00a715001 et seq., offers States federal money to improve\r\ncommunity services, such as medical care and job train\r\ning, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See\r\n\u00a7\u00a715023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State\r\nmust establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system\r\n\u201cto protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\r\ndevelopmental disabilities.\u201d \u00a715043(a)(1). The P&A sys\r\ntem receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.\r\n\u00a715042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v.

C. \u00a710801 et seq.,\r\nincreases that separate funding and extends the mission\r\nof P&A systems to include the mentally ill. \u00a7\u00a710802(2),\r\n10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under\r\nthese statutes.\r\n   Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&A system must\r\nhave certain powers. The system \u201cshall . . . have the\r\nauthority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .\r\nif the incidents are reported to the system or if there is\r\nprobable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\u201d\r\n\u00a715043(a)(2)(B); \u00a710805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu\r\ntory requirements, it must be given access to \u201call records\u201d\r\nof individuals who may have been abused, see\r\n\u00a715043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); \u00a710805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as\r\n\u201cother records that are relevant to conducting an investi\r\ngation,\u201d \u00a715043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a\r\nP&A system have authority to \u201cpursue legal, administra\r\ntive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to\r\nensure the protection of\u201d its charges. \u00a715043(a)(2)(A)(i);\r\nsee \u00a710805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own\r\nrights, a P&A system may \u201cpursue administrative, legal,\r\nand other remedies on behalf of\u201d those it protects.\r\n\u00a710805(a)(1)(C); see \u00a715044(b).\r\n   A participating State is free to appoint either a state\r\nagency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system.\r\n\u00a715044(a); \u00a710805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig\r\nnated entity must have certain structural features that\r\nensure its independence from the State\u2019s government.

The Virginia\r\nOffice for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an \u201cinde\r\npendent state agency.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a751.5\u201339.2(A)\r\n(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven \u201cnonlegislative\r\ncitizen members,\u201d of whom only three are appointed by\r\nthe Governor. \u00a751.5\u201339.2(B). The remaining eight are\r\nappointed by components of the legislature: five by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen\r\nate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates\r\ncandidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the\r\nappointing officials that they \u201cshall seriously consider the\r\npersons nominated and appoint such persons whenever\r\nfeasible.\u201d Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and\r\nare removable only by a court and only for specified rea\r\nsons. See \u00a751.5\u201339.2(C) and (F); \u00a724.2\u2013233 and 234 (Lexis\r\n2006).\r\n   VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive\r\nbranch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor\r\nney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who\r\nare statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA\u2019s behalf. \u00a751.5\u2013\r\n39.2(A); \u00a72.2\u2013510(5) (Lexis 2008).

It asked respondents\u2014state officials in charge\r\nof those institutions\u2014to produce any records related to\r\nrisk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the\r\nhospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents\r\nrefused, asserting that the records were protected by a\r\nstate-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi\r\nals from disclosure.\r\n4       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  VOPA then brought this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging\r\nthat the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review\r\nrecords, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that\r\nmight apply. It sought a declaration that respondents\u2019\r\nrefusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI\r\nActs, along with an injunction requiring respondents to\r\nprovide access to the records and refrain in the future\r\nfrom interfering with VOPA\u2019s right of access to them.\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds\r\nthat they are immune from suit under the Eleventh\r\nAmendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its\r\nview, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\nYoung, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\nprospective relief against state officials for violations of\r\nfederal law.

In his habeas corpus application in this\r\nCourt, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that\r\nMinnesota\u2019s sovereign immunity deprived the federal\r\ncourt of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his\r\nofficial duties.\r\n   We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti\r\ntutional legislative enactment is \u201cvoid,\u201d a state official who\r\nenforces that law \u201ccomes into conflict with the superior\r\nauthority of [the] Constitution,\u201d and therefore is \u201cstripped\r\nof his official or representative character and is subjected\r\nin his person to the consequences of his individual con\r\nduct.

It rests on\r\nthe premise\u2014less delicately called a \u201cfiction,\u201d id., at 114,\r\nn. 25\u2014that when a federal court commands a state official\r\nto do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,\r\nhe is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes.

Although we\r\nhave never encountered such a suit before, we are satis\r\nfied that entertaining VOPA\u2019s action is consistent with our\r\nprecedents and does not offend the distinctive interests\r\nprotected by sovereign immunity.\r\n                             1\r\n   In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535\r\nU. S. 635 (2002), we held that \u201c[i]n determining whether\r\nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend\r\nment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a \u2018straightfor\r\nward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\r\ncharacterized as prospective.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 645 (quoting Idaho\r\nv.

There is no doubt VOPA\u2019s suit satisfies that\r\nstraightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents\u2019\r\nrefusal to produce the requested medical records violates\r\nfederal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro\r\nduction of the records, which would prospectively abate\r\nthe alleged violation. Respondents concede that were\r\nVOPA a private organization rather than a state agency,\r\nthe doctrine would permit this action to proceed.3\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 The dissent is mistaken when it claims that applying the Verizon\r\nMaryland test would mean two of our cases were \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d\r\nPost, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). We discuss the first of those\r\ncases, Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, below. Infra, at 8. As for the second,\r\nSeminole Tribe, supra, it is inapposite. The reason we refused to\r\npermit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula\r\ntory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under\r\nmined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had\r\nforeclosed recourse to the doctrine. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73\u2013\r\n76.\r\n    Respondents now argue\u2014for the first time in this litigation\u2014that\r\nthe DD and PAIMI Acts have the same effect here. We reject that\r\nsuggestion. The fact that the Federal Government can exercise over\r\nsight of a federal spending program and even withhold or withdraw\r\n8    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   We see no reason for a different result here. Although\r\nrespondents argue that VOPA\u2019s status as a state agency\r\nchanges the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for\r\nmaking the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on\r\nthe identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been\r\nwilling to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to\r\nevade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise \u201cwould be\r\nto adhere to an empty formalism.\u201d Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe,\r\nsupra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized\r\nreflect the principle that the \u201cgeneral criterion for deter\r\nmining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the\r\neffect of the relief sought,\u201d Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not\r\nwho is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, Ex parte Young cannot\r\nbe used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of\r\nfunds from the State\u2019s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,\r\n415 U. S. 651, 666 (1974); or an order for specific perform\r\nance of a State\u2019s contract, see id., at 666\u2013667; In re Ayers,\r\n123 U. S. 443 (1887).\r\n   Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely,\r\nis an application of this principle. There we refused to\r\nallow an Indian Tribe to use Ex parte Young to obtain\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive\r\nright to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands\r\nin Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regu\r\nlations governing that land. 521 U. S., at 265. We deter\r\nmined that the suit was \u201cthe functional equivalent of a\r\nquiet title suit against Idaho,\u201d would \u201cextinguish . . . the\r\nState\u2019s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long\r\ndeemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,\u201d\r\nand thus was barred by sovereign immunity.

Indeed, they concede that the very\r\ninjunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a\r\nfederal court at the instance of a private P&A system.\r\n                               2\r\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining\r\nVOPA\u2019s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless\r\ninfringe Virginia\u2019s sovereign interests because it dimin\r\nishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate\r\na dispute between its components. See Brief for Respon\r\ndents 23\u201326; post, at 4\u20138 (arguing that \u201c \u2018special sover\r\neignty interests\u2019 \u201d bar VOPA\u2019s lawsuit (quoting Coeur\r\nd\u2019Alene Tribe, supra, at 281)). We disagree. As an initial\r\nmatter, we do not understand how a State\u2019s stature could\r\nbe diminished to any greater degree when its own agency\r\npolices its officers\u2019 compliance with their federal obliga\r\ntions, than when a private person hales those officers into\r\nfederal court for that same purpose\u2014something everyone\r\nagrees is proper.4 And in this case, of course, VOPA\u2019s\r\npower to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia\u2019s\r\nown decision to establish a public, rather than a private,\r\nP&A system.

We think the dissent\u2019s principle of familial affront less than univer\r\nsally applicable, even with respect to real families, never mind govern\r\nmental siblings. Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testa\r\nmentary disposition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.\r\nAnd confining one\u2019s child to his room is called grounding, while confin\r\ning a stranger\u2019s child is called kidnaping. Jurisdiction over this case\r\ndoes not depend on which is the most apt comparison.\r\n10    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncourt as a plaintiff.5\r\n  But even if it were true that the State\u2019s dignity were\r\noffended in some way by the maintenance of this action in\r\nfederal court, that would not prove respondents\u2019 case.\r\nDenial of sovereign immunity, to be sure, offends the\r\ndignity of a State; but not every offense to the dignity of a\r\nState constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity. The\r\nspecific indignity against which sovereign immunity pro\r\ntects is the insult to a State of being haled into court\r\nwithout its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases\r\nreasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the\r\nsuit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state\r\ntreasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just\r\nbecause the suit happens to be brought by another state\r\nagency. Respondents\u2019 asserted dignitary harm is simply\r\nunconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.\r\n  The dissent complains that applying Ex parte Young to\r\nthis lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the op\r\nposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.\r\nPost, at 7. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of\r\nletting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have\r\nnothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity\u2014\r\nwhether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather\r\nthan against its officers. But it is not a consequence of the\r\nfederal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if\r\nthe federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dis\r\nsent would require.

That would be true if we were\r\nrelying on the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. We are\r\nnot. We rely upon Ex parte Young. We say that Virginia has only itself\r\nto blame for the position in which it finds itself, not because it con\r\nsented to suit, but because it created a state entity to sue, instead of\r\nleaving the task to a private entity. It did not have to know that this\r\nwould allow suit in federal court. Know or not know, Ex parte Young\r\nproduces that result.\r\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Yet\r\nno one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign\r\nimmunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of\r\nEx parte Young, there has been no violation of sovereign\r\nimmunity, the prospect of a federal judge\u2019s resolving\r\nVOPA\u2019s dispute with respondents does not make it so.\r\n   We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the\r\nFederal Government\u2019s power to affect the internal opera\r\ntions of a State. See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521\r\nU. S. 898 (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state\r\nofficers); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 579 (1911) (Con\r\ngress may not dictate a State\u2019s capital). But those limits\r\nmust be found in some textual provision or structural\r\npremise of the Constitution. Additional limits cannot be\r\nsmuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a\r\nsuit in federal court that does not violate the State\u2019s sov\r\nereign immunity. 7\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 The dissent agrees that because of the \u201c \u2018constitutional plan,\u2019 \u201d post,\r\n\r\nat 8, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v.

It has not demonstrated that sover\r\neign immunity has anything at all to say about federal courts\u2019 adjudi\r\ncating interagency disputes.\r\n  7 We have no occasion to pass on other questions of federalism lurk\r\n\r\ning in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper\r\n12    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v.

Respondents rightly observe that federal\r\ncourts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by\r\nstate agencies against other state officials. That does give\r\nus pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a\r\nconstitutional infirmity, see, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ____,\r\n____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity\r\ndecisions have traditionally warned against \u201c \u2018anomalous\r\nand unheard-of proceedings or suits,\u2019 \u201d Alden, 527 U. S., at\r\n727 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 18).\r\n  Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past con\r\nstitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is\r\nthe case here. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\nexception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two\r\nthings: first, a federal right that it possesses against its\r\nparent State; and second, authority to sue other state\r\nofficials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto\r\nwielded by the state government. These conditions will\r\nrarely coincide\u2014and at least the latter of them cannot\r\nexist without the consent of the State that created the\r\nagency and defined its powers.            See post, at 3\u20134\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). We are unaware that the\r\nnecessary conditions have ever presented themselves\r\nexcept in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the\r\nparties have referred us to no examples.8 Thus, the ap\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nexercise of Congress\u2019s enumerated powers.

But we conclude no such encroachment is occa\r\nsioned by straightforwardly applying Ex parte Young to\r\nallow this suit. It was Virginia law that created VOPA\r\nand gave it the power to sue state officials. In that cir\r\ncumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\r\nto VOPA\u2019s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the\r\nsame terms as any other litigant.\r\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\r\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                                           It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\r\ndecision of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ndisputes.\u201d Post, at 11.

S. 89, 103 (1984) (\u201cUnder the theory\r\nof Young, such a suit [for restitution] would not be one\r\nagainst the State since the federal-law allegation would\r\nstrip the state officer of his official authority. Neverthe\r\nless, retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh\r\nAmendment\u201d). And Pennhurst declined to extend Young\r\nto suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need\r\nto ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justi\r\nfication for restricting state sovereignty. 465 U. S., at\r\n105\u2013106.\r\n   The \u201cstraightforward inquiry\u201d of Verizon Md. derives\r\nfrom Edelman and Pennhurst, both of which defined im\r\nportant limits on Young in order to respect state sover\r\neignty while still adhering to principles necessary to im\r\nplement the Supremacy Clause. As a result, Verizon Md.\r\nincorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to\r\nreject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved\r\nthe same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense\r\nthat was at issue in Young. But when Young\u2019s application\r\nis explored in novel contexts, as in Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene\r\nTribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997), and also in this case,\r\nthe inquiry \u201cproves more complex,\u201d Verizon Md., supra, at\r\n648 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\r\n   In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protec\r\ntion and Advocacy may rely on Young, despite the some\r\nwhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue\r\nofficials of the same State in federal court. In the posture\r\nof the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as\r\nsumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it\r\nseeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the\r\nSupremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important\r\ninterest is the need to preserve \u201cthe dignity and respect\r\nafforded a State, which the immunity is designed to pro\r\ntect.\u201d Coeur d\u2019Alene, supra, at 268. Permitting a state\r\nagency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\r\n\r\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\nimplicate the State\u2019s important sovereign interest in using\r\nits own courts to control the distribution of power among\r\nits own agents. But the affront to the State\u2019s dignity is\r\ndiminished to some extent when it is noted that if the\r\nState had elected the alternate course of designating a\r\nprivate protection and advocacy system it then would have\r\navoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat\r\ning in the federal program. The availability of that alter\r\nnate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of\r\nthe validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only\r\nquestion here is the reach of the Young exception.\r\n   Virginia\u2019s concern that the holding here upsets the\r\nfederal balance is further mitigated by the various protec\r\ntions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure\r\nthat state officials do not too often call upon the federal\r\ncourts to resolve their intramural disputes.\r\n   First, and most important, state law must authorize an\r\nagency or official to sue another arm of the State. If\r\nStates do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in\r\nfederal court, they need not empower their officers or\r\nagencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if\r\nstate officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they\r\nmay invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal\r\ncapacities.\r\n   Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state\r\nlaw as to an officer\u2019s or agency\u2019s power to sue, or any other\r\nstate-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts\r\nshould abstain under Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Pullman\r\nCo., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor\r\ntance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial\r\nintervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is\r\nnecessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve\r\na dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution\r\nof the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.\r\nLikewise, certification of questions of state law to the state\r\ncourts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con\r\n4    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\ntroversy. Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391\r\n(1974) (Certification \u201chelps build a cooperative judicial\r\nfederalism\u201d).\r\n   Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state\r\nofficials or agencies to assert against other arms of the\r\nState. True, officials may assert that their personal fed\r\neral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam\r\nple where the State engages in discriminatory employ\r\nment practices. But the statutory framework in the case\r\nnow before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state\r\nagency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat\r\nutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers\r\nor agencies, and the Constitution\u2019s rights-creating Clauses\r\nprotect persons rather than officers. Because the Young\r\nexception is available only to those who assert federal\r\nviolations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern\r\nment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar\r\nrow one.\r\n   All this is simply to underscore that the program at\r\nissue may present constitutional questions but that the\r\nparties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does\r\nnot argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend\r\ning power under Article I, \u00a78 by forcing a state that wishes\r\nto designate a public agency as its advocacy system to\r\nallow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring\r\nthat the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42\r\nU. S. C. \u00a715043(a)(2)(G) (system must \u201cbe independent of\r\nany agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita\r\ntion to individuals with developmental disabilities\u201d);\r\n\u00a715044(a)(2) (\u201c[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the\r\ngoverning board may be appointed by the chief executive\r\nofficer of the State\u201d). Young\u2014a court-made doctrine based\r\non convenience, fiction, or both\u2014neither implicates nor\r\nsubsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the\r\nexcessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be\r\nmost cautious before deciding cases that might later lead\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming, as the Court\r\nmust, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow\r\nquestion is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the\r\nsovereign immunity bar.\r\n  One might doubt whether the constitutional question\r\nmay be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court\r\nwields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to\r\nvindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court\r\nshould not extend the fiction in the name of claims that\r\nmay rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is\r\nmisplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs\r\ncourts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre\r\nserves its validity, but the specter of a statute\u2019s unconsti\r\ntutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent\r\nquestion of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a\r\nstatute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate\r\nthe case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal\r\nright for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect\r\nto invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court\r\nshould not permit the commission of acts that violate a\r\nfederal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted\r\nbeyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed\r\nto vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious\r\naffront to state sovereignty in light of the options available\r\nto the State under the program, it may proceed.\r\n  With these observations, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Only after determining that\r\nCongress had not done so did the Court conclude that the\r\nsuit could go forward under Ex parte Young.\r\n  If Verizon\u2019s formulation set forth the only requirements\r\nfor bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our\r\nrecent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole\r\nTribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often \u201cfound\r\nfederal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when\r\nthat suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order\r\nto end a continuing violation of federal law.\u201d 517 U. S., at\r\n73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,\r\nhowever, that the \u201csituation presented\u201d there was \u201csuffi\r\nciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action so as to preclude the availability of\r\nthat doctrine.\u201d Ibid.2\r\n  In Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an\r\n\u201callegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the\r\nrequested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to\r\ninvoke the Young fiction.\u201d 521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis\r\nadded). The Court held, however, that the action could\r\nnot proceed under Ex parte Young because it implicated\r\n\u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d\u2014in that case, the State\u2019s\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  2 While I agree that in Seminole Tribe \u201cwe refused to permit suit to\r\n\r\nproceed\u201d under Ex parte Young because Congress \u201chad foreclosed\r\nrecourse to the doctrine,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 3, that simply confirms my point\r\nthat the availability of Young depends on more than just whether\r\nVerizon\u2019s prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, Seminole Tribe\r\nmakes clear that a plaintiff who files a \u201ccomplaint alleg[ing] an ongoing\r\nviolation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as\r\nprospective,\u201d Verizon, 535 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under\r\nYoung.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Allain, 478 U. S. 265\r\n(1986), there are \u201ccertain types of cases that formally meet\r\nthe Young requirements of a state official acting inconsis\r\ntently with federal law but that stretch that case too far\r\nand would upset the balance of federal and state interests\r\nthat it embodies.\u201d Id., at 277. This is one of those cases.\r\n  In refusing to extend Ex parte Young to claims that\r\ninvolve \u201cspecial sovereignty interests,\u201d the Court in Coeur\r\nd\u2019Alene Tribe warned against a rote application of the Ex\r\nparte Young fiction:\r\n        \u201cTo interpret Young to permit a federal-court action\r\n    to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory\r\n    and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,\r\n    named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere\r\n    to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle\r\n    . . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a\r\n    real limitation on a federal court\u2019s federal-question ju\r\n    risdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh\r\n    Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me\r\n    chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the\r\n    Young exception must reflect a proper understanding\r\n    of its role in our federal system and respect for state\r\n    courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic\r\n    tion.\u201d 521 U. S., at 270.\r\n                              B\r\n   It is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law by a state official and\r\nseeks only prospective relief. If this were a \u201ctraditional Ex\r\nparte Young action,\u201d Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti\r\ntioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under\r\nthat case. This, however, is anything but a traditional\r\ncase\u2014and petitioner is anything but a typical Ex parte\r\nYoung plaintiff.\r\n6    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Unlike the plaintiffs in Ex parte Young\u2014and, for that\r\nmatter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to\r\ninvoke Ex parte Young before this Court\u2014petitioner is a\r\nstate agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in\r\nfederal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante\r\nat 12\u201313, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (\u201cPerhaps the most telling indi\r\ncation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of\r\nhistorical precedent\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\r\ncf. Alden, 527 U. S., at 743\u2013745; Printz v. United States,\r\n521 U. S. 898, 905\u2013910, 918, 925 (1997). This is especially\r\ntrue in light of the \u201cpresumption\u201d we articulated more\r\nthan 120 years ago in Hans v. Louisiana, that States are\r\nimmune from suits that would have been \u201canomalous and\r\nunheard of when the Constitution was adopted.\u201d Hans,\r\n134 U. S., at 18; see also Alden, supra, at 727 (invoking\r\npresumption).\r\n   Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of\r\nsovereign immunity, we have \u201cattribute[d] great signifi\r\ncance\u201d to the absence of analogous suits \u201cat the time of the\r\nfounding or for many years thereafter.\u201d Federal Maritime\r\nComm\u2019n, 535 U. S., at 755. This sort of suit was not only\r\nanomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it\r\nwas anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The Hans\r\npresumption applies here with full force.\r\n   The Court speculates that these suits have not previ\r\nously arisen because the necessary conditions\u2014state\r\nagencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state\r\nveto\u2014are themselves novel. See ante, at 12; see also ante,\r\nat 3\u20134 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim\r\nply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for\r\nmere rote application of Ex parte Young.\r\n   In addition to its novel character, petitioner\u2019s complaint\r\n\u201cconflicts directly with the principles of federalism that\r\nunderlie the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nat 106. In Alden, we held that state sovereign immu-\r\nnity prohibited Congress from authorizing \u201cprivate suits\r\nagainst nonconsenting States in their own courts.\u201d 527\r\nU. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit\r\none branch of state government, the \u201cState\u2019s own courts,\u201d\r\n\u201cto coerce the other branches of the State\u201d and \u201cto turn the\r\nState against itself.\u201d Ibid.\r\n  Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state\r\nagency on one side, and state executive officials on the\r\nother. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov\r\nernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.\r\nHere extending Young forces the State to defend itself\r\nagainst itself in federal court.\r\n  Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title\r\nof \u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d in its complaint, App.\r\n10; respondents are state officials acting in an official\r\ncapacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one\r\nthing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the\r\nCommonwealth will lose. Because of today\u2019s holding, a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail.\r\n  Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal\r\ncourt; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that\r\nthis intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.\r\nThis is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to\r\nguard against. See ante, at 10 (\u201cThe specific indignity\r\nagainst which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to\r\na State of being haled into court without its consent\u201d).\r\nThat indignity is compounded when the State is haled into\r\nfederal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal\r\nstate dispute.\r\n  The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no\r\nsovereign interest in determining where such disputes will\r\nbe resolved. See ante, at 10\u201311, and n. 6. It is one thing\r\nfor a State to decide that its components may sue one\r\n8     VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nanother in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite\r\nanother thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal\r\ncourt against the State\u2019s wishes. For this reason, the\r\nCourt\u2019s examples of other suits pitting state entities\r\nagainst one another are inapposite. In each of those hy\r\npotheticals, the State consented to having a particular\r\nforum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.3\r\n   In sum, the \u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d implicated\r\nhere make this case \u201csufficiently different from that giving\r\nrise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to pre\r\nclude the availability of that doctrine.\u201d Seminole Tribe,\r\n517 U. S., at 73. I would cling to reality and not extend\r\nthe fiction of Ex parte Young to cover petitioner\u2019s suit.\r\n                             II\r\n   The Court offers several justifications for its expansion\r\nof Ex parte Young. None is persuasive.\r\n   The Court first contends that whether the Ex parte\r\nYoung fiction should be applied turns only on the \u201crelief\r\nsought\u201d in a case. Ante, at 8\u20139 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior\r\ncases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.\r\nSee, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664\u2013671. That may well\r\nbe because \u201cthe difference between the type of relief\r\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this\r\n\r\nCourt from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it\r\nhad been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that \u201cit is\r\ninherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes\r\ncognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court\r\nof the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to\r\nthe original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.\u201d McKes\r\nson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of\r\nBusiness Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted). By contrast, there is nothing \u201cinherent in the\r\nconstitutional plan\u201d that warrants lower federal courts handling\r\nintrastate disputes absent a State\u2019s consent.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nunder Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that\r\nbetween day and night.\u201d Id., at 667. But the Court is\r\nwrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and\r\ncategorically conclude that there can be no other basis for\r\ndetermining whether to extend Ex parte Young\u2019s fiction.\r\n   The thrust of the Court\u2019s argument appears to be that,\r\nbecause the relief sought here is no different from that\r\nwhich could be sought in a suit by a private protection and\r\nadvocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should\r\nalso apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7\u2013\r\n9. But private entities are different from public ones:\r\nThey are private. When private litigants are involved, the\r\nState is not turned against itself.\r\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there\r\nis indeed a real difference between a suit against the State\r\nbrought by a private party and one brought by a state\r\nagency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal\r\nism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate\r\nresults may be the same\u2014a full stomach and a dead\r\nbody\u2014it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.\r\nI would think it more an affront to someone\u2019s dignity to be\r\nsued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While\r\nneither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would\r\nbe equally received.\r\n   The Court also contends that petitioner\u2019s ability to sue\r\nstate officials in federal court \u201cis a consequence of Vir\r\nginia\u2019s own decision to establish a public [protection and\r\nadvocacy] system.\u201d Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia\r\nhas consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That\r\nargument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek\r\ncertiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565\r\nF. 3d 110, 116\u2013118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.\r\n   Instead the Court claims that \u201cVirginia has only itself to\r\nblame\u201d\u2014if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it\r\ncould have chosen to establish a private entity instead.\r\nAnte, at 9\u201310, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\n10   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nconcurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect\r\nthat an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from\r\nchallenge simply because a constitutional alternative is\r\navailable. And here the public and private systems are\r\nnot interchangeable alternatives in any event.\r\n   The Court\u2019s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes\r\nVirginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte\r\nYoung applies to this arrangement\u2014that for the first time\r\nin history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in\r\nfederal court\u2014can the Court suggest that Virginia know\r\ningly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.\r\n   In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir\r\nginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent\r\nlitigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same\r\n\u201cas any other litigant.\u201d Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not\r\nlike any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys\r\nsome independence from the State\u2019s executive branch, that\r\ndoes not mean petitioner is independent from the State.\r\nAs noted, petitioner certainly views itself as \u201cThe Com\r\nmonwealth of Virginia,\u201d App. 10, and would presumably\r\ninvoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of\r\nsovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how\r\na State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among\r\ndifferent state agencies or officials.\r\n   The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because\r\npetitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it\r\nmay sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13\r\n(\u201cthe Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\u201d since it\r\n\u201cwas Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the\r\npower to sue state officials\u201d). There is more to this case\r\nthan merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the\r\nAttorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions\r\ncited by the Court say nothing about actions against the\r\nState in federal court.\r\n   If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthen scores of state entities now \u201csuddenly possess the\r\nauthority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other\r\nstate officials\u201d in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.\r\nThere would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to\r\nsuch suits. Given the number of state agencies across the\r\ncountry that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,\r\ne.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11\u2013\r\n13, the Court\u2019s decision today could potentially lead to all\r\nsorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal\r\nstate government disputes.\r\n   And there is also no reason to think that the Court\u2019s\r\nholding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to\r\nthe Court\u2019s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some\r\nlevel of independence could as a matter of federal law\r\nbring suit against other state officials in federal court.\r\nDisputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet\r\nrooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  No one questions the continued vitality or importance of\r\nthe doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte\r\nYoung was about affording relief to a private party against\r\nunconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving\r\na dispute between two different state actors. That is a\r\nmatter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.\r\n  Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419\r\n(1793)\u2014permitting States to be sued by private parties in\r\nfederal court\u2014\u201ccreated such a shock of surprise\u201d through\r\nout the country \u201cthat the Eleventh Amendment was at\r\nonce proposed and adopted.\u201d Principality of Monaco v.\r\nMississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934). It is fair to say that\r\ntoday\u2019s decision will probably not trigger a similar re\r\nsponse. But however much their practical functions and\r\nprominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the\r\nStates remain a vital element of our political structure.\r\nSovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature\r\n12   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncommensurate with their role under the Constitution.\r\nAllowing one part of the State to sue another in federal\r\ncourt, so that a federal judge decides an important dispute\r\nbetween state officials, undermines state sovereignty in\r\nan unprecedented and direct way. The fiction of Ex parte\r\nYoung should not be extended to permit so real an\r\nintrusion.\r\n   Because I believe the Court\u2019s novel expansion of Ex\r\nparte Young is inconsistent with the federal system estab\r\nlished by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.\r\n</pre>",
