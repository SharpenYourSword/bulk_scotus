STEWART, COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA \r\n\r\n      DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH\r\n\r\n      AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n    No. 09–529.      Argued December 1, 2010—Decided April 19, 2011\r\nTogether, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights\r\n  Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\r\n  with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to\r\n  improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis\r\n  abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es\r\n  tablish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system “to protect and advo\r\n  cate [those individuals’] rights.”      42 U. S. C. §15043(a)(1).     A\r\n  participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private\r\n  nonprofit entity as its P&A system, but if a state agency it must have\r\n  authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen\r\n  cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,\r\n  petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au\r\n  thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals’ rights, free of\r\n  executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia’s at\r\n  torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.\r\n    While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental\r\n  hospitals, VOPA asked respondents—state officials in charge of those\r\n  hospitals—to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,\r\n  asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo\r\n  sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec\r\n  laration that respondents’ refusal to produce the records violated the\r\n  DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro\r\n  duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with\r\n  VOPA’s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground\r\n2       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                             Syllabus\r\n\r\n    that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but\r\n    the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\n    Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\n    prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.\r\n    The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap\r\n    ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.\r\nHeld: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro\r\n spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the\r\n same State. Pp. 4–13.\r\n    (a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a\r\n valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri\r\n vate person’s suit against a State. Pp. 4–5.\r\n    (b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important\r\n limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces\r\n sary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” Penn\r\n hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests\r\n on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to\r\n do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the\r\n State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply “when ‘the\r\n state is the . . . party in interest.’ ” Id., at 101. Pp. 5–6.\r\n    (c) Entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with precedent and\r\n does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im\r\n munity. Pp. 6–13.\r\n       (1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S.\r\n 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine’s applica\r\n bility, “a court need only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into\r\n whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\r\n and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645.\r\n VOPA’s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac\r\n tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a\r\n state agency. The “general criterion for determining when a suit is in\r\n fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,” Penn\r\n hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap\r\n plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.\r\n 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young\r\n to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would “extinguish\r\n [Idaho’s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte\r\n gral part of its territory.” Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no\r\n argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of\r\n Virginia’s sovereignty. Pp. 7–9.\r\n       (2) Respondents claim that a State’s dignity is diminished when\r\n a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a\r\n State’s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own\r\n agency sues to enforce its officers’ compliance with federal law than\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA’s power to sue state\r\n  officials is a consequence of Virginia’s own decision to establish a\r\n  public P&A system. Not every offense to a State’s dignity constitutes\r\n  a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which\r\n  sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled\r\n  into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit\r\n  happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9–11.\r\n       (3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence\r\n  of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\n  exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses\r\n  against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce\r\n  that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi\r\n  tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the\r\n  Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.\r\n  Pp. 12–13.\r\n568 F. 3d 110, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\r\nTHOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

S. 123\r\n(1908), allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospec\r\ntive relief against state officials brought by another agency\r\nof the same State.\r\n                             I\r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of\r\nRights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 114 Stat. 1677, 42 U. S. C.\r\n§15001 et seq., offers States federal money to improve\r\ncommunity services, such as medical care and job train\r\ning, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See\r\n§§15023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State\r\nmust establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system\r\n“to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\r\ndevelopmental disabilities.” §15043(a)(1). The P&A sys\r\ntem receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.\r\n§15042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act\r\n(PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U. S. C. §10801 et seq.,\r\nincreases that separate funding and extends the mission\r\nof P&A systems to include the mentally ill. §§10802(2),\r\n10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under\r\nthese statutes.\r\n   Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&A system must\r\nhave certain powers. The system “shall . . . have the\r\nauthority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .\r\nif the incidents are reported to the system or if there is\r\nprobable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”\r\n§15043(a)(2)(B); §10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu\r\ntory requirements, it must be given access to “all records”\r\nof individuals who may have been abused, see\r\n§15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); §10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as\r\n“other records that are relevant to conducting an investi\r\ngation,” §15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a\r\nP&A system have authority to “pursue legal, administra\r\ntive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to\r\nensure the protection of” its charges. §15043(a)(2)(A)(i);\r\nsee §10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own\r\nrights, a P&A system may “pursue administrative, legal,\r\nand other remedies on behalf of” those it protects.\r\n§10805(a)(1)(C); see §15044(b).\r\n   A participating State is free to appoint either a state\r\nagency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system.\r\n§15044(a); §10805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig\r\nnated entity must have certain structural features that\r\nensure its independence from the State’s government. The\r\nDD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than\r\none-third of the members of the system’s governing board,\r\n§15044(a)(2), and restricts the State’s ability to impose\r\nhiring freezes or other measures that would impair the\r\nsystem’s ability to carry out its mission, §15043(a)(2)(K).\r\nOnce a State designates an entity as its P&A system, it\r\nmay not change its selection without “good cause.”\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n§15043(a)(4)(A).\r\n   Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated\r\na government entity as their P&A system. The Virginia\r\nOffice for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an “inde\r\npendent state agency.” Va. Code Ann. §51.5–39.2(A)\r\n(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven “nonlegislative\r\ncitizen members,” of whom only three are appointed by\r\nthe Governor. §51.5–39.2(B). The remaining eight are\r\nappointed by components of the legislature: five by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen\r\nate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates\r\ncandidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the\r\nappointing officials that they “shall seriously consider the\r\npersons nominated and appoint such persons whenever\r\nfeasible.” Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and\r\nare removable only by a court and only for specified rea\r\nsons. See §51.5–39.2(C) and (F); §24.2–233 and 234 (Lexis\r\n2006).\r\n   VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive\r\nbranch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor\r\nney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who\r\nare statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA’s behalf. §51.5–\r\n39.2(A); §2.2–510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe\r\ncifically empowers VOPA to “initiate any proceedings to\r\nsecure the rights” of disabled individuals. §51.5–39.2(A).\r\n                             B\r\n   In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths\r\nof two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental\r\nhospitals. It asked respondents—state officials in charge\r\nof those institutions—to produce any records related to\r\nrisk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the\r\nhospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents\r\nrefused, asserting that the records were protected by a\r\nstate-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi\r\nals from disclosure.\r\n4       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  VOPA then brought this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging\r\nthat the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review\r\nrecords, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that\r\nmight apply. It sought a declaration that respondents’\r\nrefusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI\r\nActs, along with an injunction requiring respondents to\r\nprovide access to the records and refrain in the future\r\nfrom interfering with VOPA’s right of access to them.\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds\r\nthat they are immune from suit under the Eleventh\r\nAmendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its\r\nview, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\nYoung, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\nprospective relief against state officials for violations of\r\nfederal law.

Virginia v. Reinhard,\r\n568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA’s lawsuit to be\r\nan “intramural contest” that “encroaches more severely on\r\nthe dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte\r\nYoung action brought by a private plaintiff,” the Court of\r\nAppeals concluded it was not authorized by that case.

Georgia, 2 Dall.\r\n419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a\r\nnoncitizen of the State. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134\r\nU. S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh\r\nAmendment to confirm the structural understanding that\r\nStates entered the Union with their sovereign immunity\r\nintact, unlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.\r\nBlatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779\r\n(1991); see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal\r\nderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). Our cases hold that the\r\nStates have retained their traditional immunity from suit,\r\n“except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain\r\nconstitutional amendments.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.\r\n706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu\r\nnity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre\r\npaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675–\r\n676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may\r\nabrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver\r\nor valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a\r\nprivate person’s suit against a State.\r\n                             B\r\n  In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an\r\nimportant limit on the sovereign-immunity principle.\r\nThat case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reduc\r\ning the freight rates that railroads could charge. A rail\r\nroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were un\r\nconstitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal\r\ninjunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of\r\nMinnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to en\r\nforce the state law.

STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the\r\nCircuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to\r\nfederal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this\r\nCourt, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that\r\nMinnesota’s sovereign immunity deprived the federal\r\ncourt of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his\r\nofficial duties.\r\n   We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti\r\ntutional legislative enactment is “void,” a state official who\r\nenforces that law “comes into conflict with the superior\r\nauthority of [the] Constitution,” and therefore is “stripped\r\nof his official or representative character and is subjected\r\nin his person to the consequences of his individual con\r\nduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immu\r\nnity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the\r\nUnited States.” 209 U. S., at 159–160.\r\n   This doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign\r\nimmunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted\r\nas necessary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate\r\nfederal rights.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105. It rests on\r\nthe premise—less delicately called a “fiction,” id., at 114,\r\nn. 25—that when a federal court commands a state official\r\nto do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,\r\nhe is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The\r\ndoctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not\r\napply “when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in\r\ninterest,’ ” id., at 101 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Depart\r\nment of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945)), as\r\nwhen the “ ‘judgment sought would expend itself on the\r\npublic treasury or domain, or interfere with public ad\r\nministration,’ ” 465 U.

Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)\r\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\r\nment)). There is no doubt VOPA’s suit satisfies that\r\nstraightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents’\r\nrefusal to produce the requested medical records violates\r\nfederal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro\r\nduction of the records, which would prospectively abate\r\nthe alleged violation. Respondents concede that were\r\nVOPA a private organization rather than a state agency,\r\nthe doctrine would permit this action to proceed.3\r\n——————\r\n  3 The dissent is mistaken when it claims that applying the Verizon\r\nMaryland test would mean two of our cases were “wrongly decided.”\r\nPost, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). We discuss the first of those\r\ncases, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, below. Infra, at 8. As for the second,\r\nSeminole Tribe, supra, it is inapposite. The reason we refused to\r\npermit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula\r\ntory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under\r\nmined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had\r\nforeclosed recourse to the doctrine. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73–\r\n76.\r\n    Respondents now argue—for the first time in this litigation—that\r\nthe DD and PAIMI Acts have the same effect here. We reject that\r\nsuggestion. The fact that the Federal Government can exercise over\r\nsight of a federal spending program and even withhold or withdraw\r\n8    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   We see no reason for a different result here. Although\r\nrespondents argue that VOPA’s status as a state agency\r\nchanges the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for\r\nmaking the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on\r\nthe identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been\r\nwilling to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to\r\nevade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise “would be\r\nto adhere to an empty formalism.” Coeur d’Alene Tribe,\r\nsupra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized\r\nreflect the principle that the “general criterion for deter\r\nmining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the\r\neffect of the relief sought,” Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not\r\nwho is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, Ex parte Young cannot\r\nbe used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of\r\nfunds from the State’s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,\r\n415 U. S. 651, 666 (1974); or an order for specific perform\r\nance of a State’s contract, see id., at 666–667; In re Ayers,\r\n123 U. S. 443 (1887).\r\n   Coeur d’Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely,\r\nis an application of this principle. There we refused to\r\nallow an Indian Tribe to use Ex parte Young to obtain\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive\r\nright to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands\r\nin Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regu\r\nlations governing that land. 521 U. S., at 265. We deter\r\nmined that the suit was “the functional equivalent of a\r\nquiet title suit against Idaho,” would “extinguish . . . the\r\nState’s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long\r\ndeemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,”\r\nand thus was barred by sovereign immunity. Id., at 282.\r\n——————\r\nfunds—which are the chief statutory features respondents point to—\r\ndoes not demonstrate that Congress has “displayed an intent not to\r\nprovide the ‘more complete and more immediate relief’ that would\r\notherwise be available under Ex parte Young.” Verizon Maryland, 535\r\nU.

Indeed, they concede that the very\r\ninjunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a\r\nfederal court at the instance of a private P&A system.\r\n                               2\r\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining\r\nVOPA’s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless\r\ninfringe Virginia’s sovereign interests because it dimin\r\nishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate\r\na dispute between its components. See Brief for Respon\r\ndents 23–26; post, at 4–8 (arguing that “ ‘special sover\r\neignty interests’ ” bar VOPA’s lawsuit (quoting Coeur\r\nd’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281)). We disagree. As an initial\r\nmatter, we do not understand how a State’s stature could\r\nbe diminished to any greater degree when its own agency\r\npolices its officers’ compliance with their federal obliga\r\ntions, than when a private person hales those officers into\r\nfederal court for that same purpose—something everyone\r\nagrees is proper.4 And in this case, of course, VOPA’s\r\npower to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia’s\r\nown decision to establish a public, rather than a private,\r\nP&A system. We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amend\r\nment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by\r\noperation of its own laws, VOPA is admitted to federal\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  4 The dissent compares VOPA’s lawsuit to such indignities as “canni\r\n\r\nbalism” and “patricide,” since it is a greater “affront to someone’s\r\ndignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger.” Post, at\r\n9. We think the dissent’s principle of familial affront less than univer\r\nsally applicable, even with respect to real families, never mind govern\r\nmental siblings. Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testa\r\nmentary disposition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.\r\nAnd confining one’s child to his room is called grounding, while confin\r\ning a stranger’s child is called kidnaping. Jurisdiction over this case\r\ndoes not depend on which is the most apt comparison.\r\n10    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v.

The\r\nspecific indignity against which sovereign immunity pro\r\ntects is the insult to a State of being haled into court\r\nwithout its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases\r\nreasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the\r\nsuit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state\r\ntreasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just\r\nbecause the suit happens to be brought by another state\r\nagency. Respondents’ asserted dignitary harm is simply\r\nunconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.\r\n  The dissent complains that applying Ex parte Young to\r\nthis lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the op\r\nposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.\r\nPost, at 7. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of\r\nletting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have\r\nnothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity—\r\nwhether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather\r\nthan against its officers. But it is not a consequence of the\r\nfederal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if\r\nthe federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dis\r\nsent would require. There also, “[w]hatever the decision\r\n——————\r\n  5 The dissent accuses us of circular reasoning, because we “wrongly\r\n\r\nassum[e] [that] Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case.” Post, at 10. That would be true if we were\r\nrelying on the Commonwealth’s waiver of sovereign immunity. We are\r\nnot. We rely upon Ex parte Young. We say that Virginia has only itself\r\nto blame for the position in which it finds itself, not because it con\r\nsented to suit, but because it created a state entity to sue, instead of\r\nleaving the task to a private entity. It did not have to know that this\r\nwould allow suit in federal court. Know or not know, Ex parte Young\r\nproduces that result.\r\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Nor would sending\r\nthe matter to state court even avoid the prospect that “a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail,” ibid., since the state-court loser could\r\nalways ask this Court to review the matter by certiorari.\r\n(Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of\r\nsovereign immunity? But see Cohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1821).)6 And of course precisely the same\r\nthing would happen if respondents specifically waived\r\ntheir sovereign-immunity objections in this very case. Yet\r\nno one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign\r\nimmunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of\r\nEx parte Young, there has been no violation of sovereign\r\nimmunity, the prospect of a federal judge’s resolving\r\nVOPA’s dispute with respondents does not make it so.\r\n   We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the\r\nFederal Government’s power to affect the internal opera\r\ntions of a State. See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521\r\nU. S. 898 (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state\r\nofficers); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 579 (1911) (Con\r\ngress may not dictate a State’s capital). But those limits\r\nmust be found in some textual provision or structural\r\npremise of the Constitution. Additional limits cannot be\r\nsmuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a\r\nsuit in federal court that does not violate the State’s sov\r\nereign immunity. 7\r\n——————\r\n  6 The dissent agrees that because of the “ ‘constitutional plan,’ ” post,\r\n\r\nat 8, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages\r\nand Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990),\r\nthis Court can adjudicate disputes between state agencies without\r\noffending sovereign immunity. But explaining away exceptions to its\r\ntheory does not advance the ball. It has not demonstrated that sover\r\neign immunity has anything at all to say about federal courts’ adjudi\r\ncating interagency disputes.\r\n  7 We have no occasion to pass on other questions of federalism lurk\r\n\r\ning in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper\r\n12    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              3\r\n  A weightier objection, perhaps, is the relative novelty of\r\nthis lawsuit. Respondents rightly observe that federal\r\ncourts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by\r\nstate agencies against other state officials. That does give\r\nus pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a\r\nconstitutional infirmity, see, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ____,\r\n____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity\r\ndecisions have traditionally warned against “ ‘anomalous\r\nand unheard-of proceedings or suits,’ ” Alden, 527 U. S., at\r\n727 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 18).\r\n  Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past con\r\nstitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is\r\nthe case here. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\nexception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two\r\nthings: first, a federal right that it possesses against its\r\nparent State; and second, authority to sue other state\r\nofficials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto\r\nwielded by the state government. These conditions will\r\nrarely coincide—and at least the latter of them cannot\r\nexist without the consent of the State that created the\r\nagency and defined its powers.            See post, at 3–4\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). We are unaware that the\r\nnecessary conditions have ever presented themselves\r\nexcept in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the\r\nparties have referred us to no examples.8 Thus, the ap\r\n——————\r\nexercise of Congress’s enumerated powers. As JUSTICE KENNEDY ob\r\nserves, whether the Acts run afoul of some other constitutional pro\r\nvision (i.e., besides the Eleventh Amendment) “cannot be permitted\r\nto distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction.” Post, at 5 (concur\r\nring opinion).\r\n   8 We think greatly exaggerated the dissent’s concern that, “[g]iven the\r\n\r\nnumber of state agencies across the country that enjoy independent\r\nlitigating authority,” today’s decision “could potentially lead to all sorts\r\nof litigation in federal courts addressing internal state government\r\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

In any event, we are satisfied, for the\r\nreasons we have explained, that—novelty notwithstand\r\ning—the principles undergirding the Ex parte Young doc\r\ntrine support its application to actions of this kind.\r\n                      *      *    *\r\n  Like the Court of Appeals, we are mindful of the central\r\nrole autonomous States play in our federal system, and\r\nwary of approving new encroachments on their sover\r\neignty. But we conclude no such encroachment is occa\r\nsioned by straightforwardly applying Ex parte Young to\r\nallow this suit. It was Virginia law that created VOPA\r\nand gave it the power to sue state officials. In that cir\r\ncumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\r\nto VOPA’s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the\r\nsame terms as any other litigant.\r\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\r\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                                           It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\r\ndecision of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\ndisputes.” Post, at 11.

S. 89, 103 (1984) (“Under the theory\r\nof Young, such a suit [for restitution] would not be one\r\nagainst the State since the federal-law allegation would\r\nstrip the state officer of his official authority. Neverthe\r\nless, retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh\r\nAmendment”). And Pennhurst declined to extend Young\r\nto suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need\r\nto ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justi\r\nfication for restricting state sovereignty. 465 U. S., at\r\n105–106.\r\n   The “straightforward inquiry” of Verizon Md. derives\r\nfrom Edelman and Pennhurst, both of which defined im\r\nportant limits on Young in order to respect state sover\r\neignty while still adhering to principles necessary to im\r\nplement the Supremacy Clause. As a result, Verizon Md.\r\nincorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to\r\nreject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved\r\nthe same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense\r\nthat was at issue in Young. But when Young’s application\r\nis explored in novel contexts, as in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene\r\nTribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997), and also in this case,\r\nthe inquiry “proves more complex,” Verizon Md., supra, at\r\n648 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\r\n   In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protec\r\ntion and Advocacy may rely on Young, despite the some\r\nwhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue\r\nofficials of the same State in federal court. In the posture\r\nof the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as\r\nsumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it\r\nseeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the\r\nSupremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important\r\ninterest is the need to preserve “the dignity and respect\r\nafforded a State, which the immunity is designed to pro\r\ntect.” Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 268. Permitting a state\r\nagency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\r\n\r\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\nimplicate the State’s important sovereign interest in using\r\nits own courts to control the distribution of power among\r\nits own agents. But the affront to the State’s dignity is\r\ndiminished to some extent when it is noted that if the\r\nState had elected the alternate course of designating a\r\nprivate protection and advocacy system it then would have\r\navoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat\r\ning in the federal program. The availability of that alter\r\nnate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of\r\nthe validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only\r\nquestion here is the reach of the Young exception.\r\n   Virginia’s concern that the holding here upsets the\r\nfederal balance is further mitigated by the various protec\r\ntions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure\r\nthat state officials do not too often call upon the federal\r\ncourts to resolve their intramural disputes.\r\n   First, and most important, state law must authorize an\r\nagency or official to sue another arm of the State. If\r\nStates do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in\r\nfederal court, they need not empower their officers or\r\nagencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if\r\nstate officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they\r\nmay invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal\r\ncapacities.\r\n   Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state\r\nlaw as to an officer’s or agency’s power to sue, or any other\r\nstate-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts\r\nshould abstain under Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman\r\nCo., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor\r\ntance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial\r\nintervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is\r\nnecessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve\r\na dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution\r\nof the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.\r\nLikewise, certification of questions of state law to the state\r\ncourts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con\r\n4    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\ntroversy. Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391\r\n(1974) (Certification “helps build a cooperative judicial\r\nfederalism”).\r\n   Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state\r\nofficials or agencies to assert against other arms of the\r\nState. True, officials may assert that their personal fed\r\neral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam\r\nple where the State engages in discriminatory employ\r\nment practices. But the statutory framework in the case\r\nnow before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state\r\nagency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat\r\nutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers\r\nor agencies, and the Constitution’s rights-creating Clauses\r\nprotect persons rather than officers. Because the Young\r\nexception is available only to those who assert federal\r\nviolations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern\r\nment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar\r\nrow one.\r\n   All this is simply to underscore that the program at\r\nissue may present constitutional questions but that the\r\nparties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does\r\nnot argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend\r\ning power under Article I, §8 by forcing a state that wishes\r\nto designate a public agency as its advocacy system to\r\nallow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring\r\nthat the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42\r\nU. S. C. §15043(a)(2)(G) (system must “be independent of\r\nany agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita\r\ntion to individuals with developmental disabilities”);\r\n§15044(a)(2) (“[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the\r\ngoverning board may be appointed by the chief executive\r\nofficer of the State”). Young—a court-made doctrine based\r\non convenience, fiction, or both—neither implicates nor\r\nsubsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the\r\nexcessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be\r\nmost cautious before deciding cases that might later lead\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming, as the Court\r\nmust, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow\r\nquestion is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the\r\nsovereign immunity bar.\r\n  One might doubt whether the constitutional question\r\nmay be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court\r\nwields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to\r\nvindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court\r\nshould not extend the fiction in the name of claims that\r\nmay rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is\r\nmisplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs\r\ncourts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre\r\nserves its validity, but the specter of a statute’s unconsti\r\ntutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent\r\nquestion of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a\r\nstatute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate\r\nthe case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal\r\nright for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect\r\nto invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court\r\nshould not permit the commission of acts that violate a\r\nfederal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted\r\nbeyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed\r\nto vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious\r\naffront to state sovereignty in light of the options available\r\nto the State under the program, it may proceed.\r\n  With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion.\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

This\r\nhas never happened before. In order to reach this unset\r\ntling result, the Court extends the fiction of Ex parte\r\nYoung—what we have called an “empty formalism”—well\r\nbeyond the circumstances of that case. Because I cannot\r\nsubscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of\r\nwhat we have also called “a narrow exception” to a State’s\r\nsovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.\r\n                            I\r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  “The federal system established by our Constitution\r\npreserves the sovereign status of the States.” Alden v.\r\nMaine, 527 U. S. 706, 714 (1999). As confirmed by the\r\nEleventh Amendment, “[a]n integral component of that\r\nresiduary and inviolable sovereignty” is the States’ “im\r\nmunity from private suits.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.\r\nSouth Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 751–753\r\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); Hans v. Louisi\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nana, 134 U. S. 1, 13 (1890) (“ ‘It is inherent in the nature of\r\nsovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual\r\nwithout its consent’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 81 (A.\r\nHamilton))). “The preeminent purpose of state sovereign\r\nimmunity is to accord States the dignity that is consistent\r\nwith their status as sovereign entities.” Federal Maritime\r\nComm’n, supra, at 760. Accordingly, any time a State is\r\nhaled into federal court against its will, “the dignity and\r\nrespect afforded [that] State, which [sovereign] immunity\r\nis designed to protect, are placed in jeopardy.” Idaho v.\r\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268 (1997).\r\nThe immunity does not turn on whether relief will be\r\nawarded; “[t]he Eleventh Amendment is concerned not\r\nonly with the States’ ability to withstand suit, but with\r\ntheir privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico Aqueduct and\r\nSewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139,\r\n147, n. 5 (1993). See Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at\r\n769 (“the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to\r\nprotect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dig\r\nnity and respect due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)).\r\n  Because of the key role state sovereign immunity plays\r\nin our federal system, the Court has recognized only a few\r\nexceptions to that immunity. The sole one relevant here is\r\nthe “narrow exception,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\r\n517 U. S. 44, 76 (1996), established by our decision in Ex\r\nparte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). In Ex parte Young, the\r\nCourt held that private litigants could seek an injunction\r\nin federal court against a state official, prohibiting him\r\nfrom enforcing a state law claimed to violate the Federal\r\nConstitution. See id., at 159–168. As we have often ob\r\nserved, Ex parte Young rests on the “obvious fiction,”\r\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 270, that such a suit is not\r\nreally against the State, but rather against an individual\r\nwho has been “stripped of his official or representative\r\ncharacter” because of his unlawful conduct, Ex parte\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nYoung, supra, at 159–160.1\r\n  While we have consistently acknowledged the important\r\nrole Ex parte Young plays in “promot[ing] the vindication\r\nof federal rights,” we have been cautious not to give that\r\ndecision “an expansive interpretation.” Pennhurst State\r\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105, 102\r\n(1984). Indeed, the history of our Ex parte Young juris\r\nprudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this\r\nnarrow exception is “narrowly construed,” 465 U. S., at\r\n114, n. 25. We have, for example, held that the fiction of\r\nEx parte Young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff\r\nseeks retroactive relief, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,\r\n678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on\r\nstate law, Pennhurst, supra, at 106; where the federal law\r\nviolation is no longer “ongoing,” Green v. Mansour, 474\r\nU. S. 64, 71 (1985); “where Congress has prescribed a\r\ndetailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a\r\nState” of the claimed federal right, Seminole Tribe, supra,\r\nat 74; and where “special sovereignty interests” are impli\r\ncated, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281.\r\n  We recently stated that when “determining whether the\r\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend\r\nment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightfor\r\nward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\r\ncharacterized as prospective.” Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\r\nServ. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 645 (2002) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). But not every plaintiff who\r\ncomplies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit\r\nunder Ex parte Young. Indeed, in Verizon itself the Court\r\nwent beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in con\r\n——————\r\n   1 Ex parte Young also rests on the “well-recognized irony that an offi\r\n\r\ncial’s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst\r\nState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105 (1984)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n4     VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nsidering whether Ex parte Young applied. After deciding\r\nthe plaintiffs “clearly satisfie[d]” the “straightforward\r\ninquiry,” the Court went on to examine whether Congress\r\nhad created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in\r\nSeminole Tribe. 535 U. S., at 645, 647–648 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Only after determining that\r\nCongress had not done so did the Court conclude that the\r\nsuit could go forward under Ex parte Young.\r\n  If Verizon’s formulation set forth the only requirements\r\nfor bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our\r\nrecent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole\r\nTribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often “found\r\nfederal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when\r\nthat suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order\r\nto end a continuing violation of federal law.” 517 U. S., at\r\n73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,\r\nhowever, that the “situation presented” there was “suffi\r\nciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action so as to preclude the availability of\r\nthat doctrine.” Ibid.2\r\n  In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an\r\n“allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the\r\nrequested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to\r\ninvoke the Young fiction.” 521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis\r\nadded). The Court held, however, that the action could\r\nnot proceed under Ex parte Young because it implicated\r\n“special sovereignty interests”—in that case, the State’s\r\n——————\r\n  2 While I agree that in Seminole Tribe “we refused to permit suit to\r\n\r\nproceed” under Ex parte Young because Congress “had foreclosed\r\nrecourse to the doctrine,” ante, at 7, n. 3, that simply confirms my point\r\nthat the availability of Young depends on more than just whether\r\nVerizon’s prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, Seminole Tribe\r\nmakes clear that a plaintiff who files a “complaint alleg[ing] an ongoing\r\nviolation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as\r\nprospective,” Verizon, 535 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under\r\nYoung.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Allain, 478 U. S. 265\r\n(1986), there are “certain types of cases that formally meet\r\nthe Young requirements of a state official acting inconsis\r\ntently with federal law but that stretch that case too far\r\nand would upset the balance of federal and state interests\r\nthat it embodies.” Id., at 277. This is one of those cases.\r\n  In refusing to extend Ex parte Young to claims that\r\ninvolve “special sovereignty interests,” the Court in Coeur\r\nd’Alene Tribe warned against a rote application of the Ex\r\nparte Young fiction:\r\n        “To interpret Young to permit a federal-court action\r\n    to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory\r\n    and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,\r\n    named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere\r\n    to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle\r\n    . . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a\r\n    real limitation on a federal court’s federal-question ju\r\n    risdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh\r\n    Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me\r\n    chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the\r\n    Young exception must reflect a proper understanding\r\n    of its role in our federal system and respect for state\r\n    courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic\r\n    tion.” 521 U. S., at 270.\r\n                              B\r\n   It is undisputed that petitioner’s complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law by a state official and\r\nseeks only prospective relief. If this were a “traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action,” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti\r\ntioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under\r\nthat case. This, however, is anything but a traditional\r\ncase—and petitioner is anything but a typical Ex parte\r\nYoung plaintiff.\r\n6    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Unlike the plaintiffs in Ex parte Young—and, for that\r\nmatter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to\r\ninvoke Ex parte Young before this Court—petitioner is a\r\nstate agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in\r\nfederal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante\r\nat 12–13, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (“Perhaps the most telling indi\r\ncation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of\r\nhistorical precedent” (internal quotation marks omitted));\r\ncf. Alden, 527 U. S., at 743–745; Printz v. United States,\r\n521 U. S. 898, 905–910, 918, 925 (1997). This is especially\r\ntrue in light of the “presumption” we articulated more\r\nthan 120 years ago in Hans v. Louisiana, that States are\r\nimmune from suits that would have been “anomalous and\r\nunheard of when the Constitution was adopted.” Hans,\r\n134 U. S., at 18; see also Alden, supra, at 727 (invoking\r\npresumption).\r\n   Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of\r\nsovereign immunity, we have “attribute[d] great signifi\r\ncance” to the absence of analogous suits “at the time of the\r\nfounding or for many years thereafter.” Federal Maritime\r\nComm’n, 535 U. S., at 755. This sort of suit was not only\r\nanomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it\r\nwas anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The Hans\r\npresumption applies here with full force.\r\n   The Court speculates that these suits have not previ\r\nously arisen because the necessary conditions—state\r\nagencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state\r\nveto—are themselves novel. See ante, at 12; see also ante,\r\nat 3–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim\r\nply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for\r\nmere rote application of Ex parte Young.\r\n   In addition to its novel character, petitioner’s complaint\r\n“conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that\r\nunderlie the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nat 106. In Alden, we held that state sovereign immu-\r\nnity prohibited Congress from authorizing “private suits\r\nagainst nonconsenting States in their own courts.” 527\r\nU. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit\r\none branch of state government, the “State’s own courts,”\r\n“to coerce the other branches of the State” and “to turn the\r\nState against itself.” Ibid.\r\n  Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state\r\nagency on one side, and state executive officials on the\r\nother. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov\r\nernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.\r\nHere extending Young forces the State to defend itself\r\nagainst itself in federal court.\r\n  Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title\r\nof “The Commonwealth of Virginia” in its complaint, App.\r\n10; respondents are state officials acting in an official\r\ncapacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one\r\nthing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the\r\nCommonwealth will lose. Because of today’s holding, a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail.\r\n  Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal\r\ncourt; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that\r\nthis intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.\r\nThis is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to\r\nguard against. See ante, at 10 (“The specific indignity\r\nagainst which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to\r\na State of being haled into court without its consent”).\r\nThat indignity is compounded when the State is haled into\r\nfederal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal\r\nstate dispute.\r\n  The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no\r\nsovereign interest in determining where such disputes will\r\nbe resolved. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 6. It is one thing\r\nfor a State to decide that its components may sue one\r\n8     VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nanother in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite\r\nanother thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal\r\ncourt against the State’s wishes. For this reason, the\r\nCourt’s examples of other suits pitting state entities\r\nagainst one another are inapposite. In each of those hy\r\npotheticals, the State consented to having a particular\r\nforum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.3\r\n   In sum, the “special sovereignty interests” implicated\r\nhere make this case “sufficiently different from that giving\r\nrise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to pre\r\nclude the availability of that doctrine.” Seminole Tribe,\r\n517 U. S., at 73. I would cling to reality and not extend\r\nthe fiction of Ex parte Young to cover petitioner’s suit.\r\n                             II\r\n   The Court offers several justifications for its expansion\r\nof Ex parte Young. None is persuasive.\r\n   The Court first contends that whether the Ex parte\r\nYoung fiction should be applied turns only on the “relief\r\nsought” in a case. Ante, at 8–9 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior\r\ncases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.\r\nSee, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664–671. That may well\r\nbe because “the difference between the type of relief\r\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted\r\n——————\r\n  3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this\r\n\r\nCourt from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it\r\nhad been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that “it is\r\ninherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes\r\ncognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court\r\nof the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to\r\nthe original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.” McKes\r\nson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of\r\nBusiness Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted). By contrast, there is nothing “inherent in the\r\nconstitutional plan” that warrants lower federal courts handling\r\nintrastate disputes absent a State’s consent.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

But the Court is\r\nwrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and\r\ncategorically conclude that there can be no other basis for\r\ndetermining whether to extend Ex parte Young’s fiction.\r\n   The thrust of the Court’s argument appears to be that,\r\nbecause the relief sought here is no different from that\r\nwhich could be sought in a suit by a private protection and\r\nadvocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should\r\nalso apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7–\r\n9. But private entities are different from public ones:\r\nThey are private. When private litigants are involved, the\r\nState is not turned against itself.\r\n   Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there\r\nis indeed a real difference between a suit against the State\r\nbrought by a private party and one brought by a state\r\nagency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal\r\nism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate\r\nresults may be the same—a full stomach and a dead\r\nbody—it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.\r\nI would think it more an affront to someone’s dignity to be\r\nsued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While\r\nneither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would\r\nbe equally received.\r\n   The Court also contends that petitioner’s ability to sue\r\nstate officials in federal court “is a consequence of Vir\r\nginia’s own decision to establish a public [protection and\r\nadvocacy] system.” Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia\r\nhas consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That\r\nargument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek\r\ncertiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565\r\nF. 3d 110, 116–118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.\r\n   Instead the Court claims that “Virginia has only itself to\r\nblame”—if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it\r\ncould have chosen to establish a private entity instead.\r\nAnte, at 9–10, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\n10   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nconcurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect\r\nthat an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from\r\nchallenge simply because a constitutional alternative is\r\navailable. And here the public and private systems are\r\nnot interchangeable alternatives in any event.\r\n   The Court’s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes\r\nVirginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte\r\nYoung applies to this arrangement—that for the first time\r\nin history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in\r\nfederal court—can the Court suggest that Virginia know\r\ningly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.\r\n   In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir\r\nginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent\r\nlitigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same\r\n“as any other litigant.” Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not\r\nlike any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys\r\nsome independence from the State’s executive branch, that\r\ndoes not mean petitioner is independent from the State.\r\nAs noted, petitioner certainly views itself as “The Com\r\nmonwealth of Virginia,” App. 10, and would presumably\r\ninvoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of\r\nsovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how\r\na State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among\r\ndifferent state agencies or officials.\r\n   The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because\r\npetitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it\r\nmay sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13\r\n(“the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle” since it\r\n“was Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the\r\npower to sue state officials”). There is more to this case\r\nthan merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the\r\nAttorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions\r\ncited by the Court say nothing about actions against the\r\nState in federal court.\r\n   If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthen scores of state entities now “suddenly possess the\r\nauthority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other\r\nstate officials” in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.\r\nThere would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to\r\nsuch suits. Given the number of state agencies across the\r\ncountry that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,\r\ne.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11–\r\n13, the Court’s decision today could potentially lead to all\r\nsorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal\r\nstate government disputes.\r\n   And there is also no reason to think that the Court’s\r\nholding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to\r\nthe Court’s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some\r\nlevel of independence could as a matter of federal law\r\nbring suit against other state officials in federal court.\r\nDisputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet\r\nrooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  No one questions the continued vitality or importance of\r\nthe doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte\r\nYoung was about affording relief to a private party against\r\nunconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving\r\na dispute between two different state actors. That is a\r\nmatter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.\r\n  Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419\r\n(1793)—permitting States to be sued by private parties in\r\nfederal court—“created such a shock of surprise” through\r\nout the country “that the Eleventh Amendment was at\r\nonce proposed and adopted.” Principality of Monaco v.\r\nMississippi, 292 U.

Argued December 1, 2010—Decided April 19, 2011\r\nTogether, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights\r\n  Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals\r\n  with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to\r\n  improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis\r\n  abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es\r\n  tablish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system “to protect and advo\r\n  cate [those individuals’] rights.”      42 U. S. C. §15043(a)(1).     A\r\n  participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private\r\n  nonprofit entity as its P&A system, but if a state agency it must have\r\n  authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen\r\n  cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,\r\n  petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au\r\n  thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals’ rights, free of\r\n  executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia’s at\r\n  torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.\r\n    While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental\r\n  hospitals, VOPA asked respondents—state officials in charge of those\r\n  hospitals—to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,\r\n  asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo\r\n  sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec\r\n  laration that respondents’ refusal to produce the records violated the\r\n  DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro\r\n  duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with\r\n  VOPA’s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground\r\n2       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                             Syllabus\r\n\r\n    that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but\r\n    the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\n    Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\n    prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.\r\n    The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap\r\n    ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.\r\nHeld: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro\r\n spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the\r\n same State. Pp. 4–13.\r\n    (a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a\r\n valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri\r\n vate person’s suit against a State. Pp. 4–5.\r\n    (b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important\r\n limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces\r\n sary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” Penn\r\n hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests\r\n on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to\r\n do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the\r\n State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply “when ‘the\r\n state is the . . . party in interest.’ ” Id., at 101. Pp. 5–6.\r\n    (c) Entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with precedent and\r\n does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im\r\n munity. Pp. 6–13.\r\n       (1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S.\r\n 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine’s applica\r\n bility, “a court need only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into\r\n whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\r\n and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645.\r\n VOPA’s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac\r\n tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a\r\n state agency. The “general criterion for determining when a suit is in\r\n fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,” Penn\r\n hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap\r\n plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.\r\n 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young\r\n to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would “extinguish\r\n [Idaho’s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte\r\n gral part of its territory.” Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no\r\n argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of\r\n Virginia’s sovereignty. Pp. 7–9.\r\n       (2) Respondents claim that a State’s dignity is diminished when\r\n a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a\r\n State’s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own\r\n agency sues to enforce its officers’ compliance with federal law than\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA’s power to sue state\r\n  officials is a consequence of Virginia’s own decision to establish a\r\n  public P&A system. Not every offense to a State’s dignity constitutes\r\n  a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which\r\n  sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled\r\n  into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit\r\n  happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9–11.\r\n       (3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence\r\n  of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\n  exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses\r\n  against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce\r\n  that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi\r\n  tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the\r\n  Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.\r\n  Pp. 12–13.\r\n568 F. 3d 110, reversed and remanded.\r\n\r\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\r\nTHOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

S. 123\r\n(1908), allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospec\r\ntive relief against state officials brought by another agency\r\nof the same State.\r\n                             I\r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of\r\nRights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 114 Stat. 1677, 42 U. S. C.\r\n§15001 et seq., offers States federal money to improve\r\ncommunity services, such as medical care and job train\r\ning, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See\r\n§§15023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State\r\nmust establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system\r\n“to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\r\ndevelopmental disabilities.” §15043(a)(1). The P&A sys\r\ntem receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.\r\n§15042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act\r\n(PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U. S. C. §10801 et seq.,\r\nincreases that separate funding and extends the mission\r\nof P&A systems to include the mentally ill. §§10802(2),\r\n10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under\r\nthese statutes.\r\n   Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&A system must\r\nhave certain powers. The system “shall . . . have the\r\nauthority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .\r\nif the incidents are reported to the system or if there is\r\nprobable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”\r\n§15043(a)(2)(B); §10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu\r\ntory requirements, it must be given access to “all records”\r\nof individuals who may have been abused, see\r\n§15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); §10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as\r\n“other records that are relevant to conducting an investi\r\ngation,” §15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a\r\nP&A system have authority to “pursue legal, administra\r\ntive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to\r\nensure the protection of” its charges. §15043(a)(2)(A)(i);\r\nsee §10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own\r\nrights, a P&A system may “pursue administrative, legal,\r\nand other remedies on behalf of” those it protects.\r\n§10805(a)(1)(C); see §15044(b).\r\n   A participating State is free to appoint either a state\r\nagency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&A system.\r\n§15044(a); §10805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig\r\nnated entity must have certain structural features that\r\nensure its independence from the State’s government. The\r\nDD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than\r\none-third of the members of the system’s governing board,\r\n§15044(a)(2), and restricts the State’s ability to impose\r\nhiring freezes or other measures that would impair the\r\nsystem’s ability to carry out its mission, §15043(a)(2)(K).\r\nOnce a State designates an entity as its P&A system, it\r\nmay not change its selection without “good cause.”\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n§15043(a)(4)(A).\r\n   Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated\r\na government entity as their P&A system. The Virginia\r\nOffice for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an “inde\r\npendent state agency.” Va. Code Ann. §51.5–39.2(A)\r\n(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven “nonlegislative\r\ncitizen members,” of whom only three are appointed by\r\nthe Governor. §51.5–39.2(B). The remaining eight are\r\nappointed by components of the legislature: five by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen\r\nate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates\r\ncandidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the\r\nappointing officials that they “shall seriously consider the\r\npersons nominated and appoint such persons whenever\r\nfeasible.” Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and\r\nare removable only by a court and only for specified rea\r\nsons. See §51.5–39.2(C) and (F); §24.2–233 and 234 (Lexis\r\n2006).\r\n   VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive\r\nbranch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor\r\nney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who\r\nare statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA’s behalf. §51.5–\r\n39.2(A); §2.2–510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe\r\ncifically empowers VOPA to “initiate any proceedings to\r\nsecure the rights” of disabled individuals. §51.5–39.2(A).\r\n                             B\r\n   In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths\r\nof two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental\r\nhospitals. It asked respondents—state officials in charge\r\nof those institutions—to produce any records related to\r\nrisk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the\r\nhospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents\r\nrefused, asserting that the records were protected by a\r\nstate-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi\r\nals from disclosure.\r\n4       VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                          v. STEWART\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  VOPA then brought this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging\r\nthat the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review\r\nrecords, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that\r\nmight apply. It sought a declaration that respondents’\r\nrefusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI\r\nActs, along with an injunction requiring respondents to\r\nprovide access to the records and refrain in the future\r\nfrom interfering with VOPA’s right of access to them.\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds\r\nthat they are immune from suit under the Eleventh\r\nAmendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its\r\nview, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte\r\nYoung, which normally allows federal courts to award\r\nprospective relief against state officials for violations of\r\nfederal law. Virginia v. Reinhard, 2008 WL 2795940, *6\r\n(ED Va., July 18, 2008).\r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed. Virginia v. Reinhard,\r\n568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA’s lawsuit to be\r\nan “intramural contest” that “encroaches more severely on\r\nthe dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte\r\nYoung action brought by a private plaintiff,” the Court of\r\nAppeals concluded it was not authorized by that case.

Georgia, 2 Dall.\r\n419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a\r\nnoncitizen of the State. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134\r\nU. S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh\r\nAmendment to confirm the structural understanding that\r\nStates entered the Union with their sovereign immunity\r\nintact, unlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.\r\nBlatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779\r\n(1991); see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal\r\nderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). Our cases hold that the\r\nStates have retained their traditional immunity from suit,\r\n“except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain\r\nconstitutional amendments.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.\r\n706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu\r\nnity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre\r\npaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675–\r\n676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may\r\nabrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver\r\nor valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a\r\nprivate person’s suit against a State.\r\n                             B\r\n  In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an\r\nimportant limit on the sovereign-immunity principle.\r\nThat case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reduc\r\ning the freight rates that railroads could charge. A rail\r\nroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were un\r\nconstitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal\r\ninjunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of\r\nMinnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to en\r\nforce the state law.

STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the\r\nCircuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to\r\nfederal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this\r\nCourt, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that\r\nMinnesota’s sovereign immunity deprived the federal\r\ncourt of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his\r\nofficial duties.\r\n   We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti\r\ntutional legislative enactment is “void,” a state official who\r\nenforces that law “comes into conflict with the superior\r\nauthority of [the] Constitution,” and therefore is “stripped\r\nof his official or representative character and is subjected\r\nin his person to the consequences of his individual con\r\nduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immu\r\nnity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the\r\nUnited States.” 209 U. S., at 159–160.\r\n   This doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign\r\nimmunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted\r\nas necessary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate\r\nfederal rights.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105. It rests on\r\nthe premise—less delicately called a “fiction,” id., at 114,\r\nn. 25—that when a federal court commands a state official\r\nto do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,\r\nhe is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The\r\ndoctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not\r\napply “when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in\r\ninterest,’ ” id., at 101 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Depart\r\nment of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945)), as\r\nwhen the “ ‘judgment sought would expend itself on the\r\npublic treasury or domain, or interfere with public ad\r\nministration,’ ” 465 U.

Although we\r\nhave never encountered such a suit before, we are satis\r\nfied that entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with our\r\nprecedents and does not offend the distinctive interests\r\nprotected by sovereign immunity.\r\n                             1\r\n   In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535\r\nU. S. 635 (2002), we held that “[i]n determining whether\r\nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend\r\nment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a ‘straightfor\r\nward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\r\ncharacterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645 (quoting Idaho\r\nv. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)\r\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\r\nment)). There is no doubt VOPA’s suit satisfies that\r\nstraightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents’\r\nrefusal to produce the requested medical records violates\r\nfederal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro\r\nduction of the records, which would prospectively abate\r\nthe alleged violation. Respondents concede that were\r\nVOPA a private organization rather than a state agency,\r\nthe doctrine would permit this action to proceed.3\r\n——————\r\n  3 The dissent is mistaken when it claims that applying the Verizon\r\nMaryland test would mean two of our cases were “wrongly decided.”\r\nPost, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). We discuss the first of those\r\ncases, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, below. Infra, at 8. As for the second,\r\nSeminole Tribe, supra, it is inapposite. The reason we refused to\r\npermit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula\r\ntory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under\r\nmined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had\r\nforeclosed recourse to the doctrine. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73–\r\n76.\r\n    Respondents now argue—for the first time in this litigation—that\r\nthe DD and PAIMI Acts have the same effect here. We reject that\r\nsuggestion. The fact that the Federal Government can exercise over\r\nsight of a federal spending program and even withhold or withdraw\r\n8    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   We see no reason for a different result here. Although\r\nrespondents argue that VOPA’s status as a state agency\r\nchanges the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for\r\nmaking the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on\r\nthe identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been\r\nwilling to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to\r\nevade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise “would be\r\nto adhere to an empty formalism.” Coeur d’Alene Tribe,\r\nsupra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized\r\nreflect the principle that the “general criterion for deter\r\nmining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the\r\neffect of the relief sought,” Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not\r\nwho is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, Ex parte Young cannot\r\nbe used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of\r\nfunds from the State’s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,\r\n415 U. S. 651, 666 (1974); or an order for specific perform\r\nance of a State’s contract, see id., at 666–667; In re Ayers,\r\n123 U. S. 443 (1887).\r\n   Coeur d’Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely,\r\nis an application of this principle. There we refused to\r\nallow an Indian Tribe to use Ex parte Young to obtain\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive\r\nright to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands\r\nin Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regu\r\nlations governing that land. 521 U. S., at 265. We deter\r\nmined that the suit was “the functional equivalent of a\r\nquiet title suit against Idaho,” would “extinguish . . . the\r\nState’s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long\r\ndeemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,”\r\nand thus was barred by sovereign immunity. Id., at 282.\r\n——————\r\nfunds—which are the chief statutory features respondents point to—\r\ndoes not demonstrate that Congress has “displayed an intent not to\r\nprovide the ‘more complete and more immediate relief’ that would\r\notherwise be available under Ex parte Young.” Verizon Maryland, 535\r\nU.

Indeed, they concede that the very\r\ninjunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a\r\nfederal court at the instance of a private P&A system.\r\n                               2\r\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining\r\nVOPA’s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless\r\ninfringe Virginia’s sovereign interests because it dimin\r\nishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate\r\na dispute between its components. See Brief for Respon\r\ndents 23–26; post, at 4–8 (arguing that “ ‘special sover\r\neignty interests’ ” bar VOPA’s lawsuit (quoting Coeur\r\nd’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281)). We disagree. As an initial\r\nmatter, we do not understand how a State’s stature could\r\nbe diminished to any greater degree when its own agency\r\npolices its officers’ compliance with their federal obliga\r\ntions, than when a private person hales those officers into\r\nfederal court for that same purpose—something everyone\r\nagrees is proper.4 And in this case, of course, VOPA’s\r\npower to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia’s\r\nown decision to establish a public, rather than a private,\r\nP&A system. We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amend\r\nment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by\r\noperation of its own laws, VOPA is admitted to federal\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  4 The dissent compares VOPA’s lawsuit to such indignities as “canni\r\n\r\nbalism” and “patricide,” since it is a greater “affront to someone’s\r\ndignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger.” Post, at\r\n9. We think the dissent’s principle of familial affront less than univer\r\nsally applicable, even with respect to real families, never mind govern\r\nmental siblings. Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testa\r\nmentary disposition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.\r\nAnd confining one’s child to his room is called grounding, while confin\r\ning a stranger’s child is called kidnaping. Jurisdiction over this case\r\ndoes not depend on which is the most apt comparison.\r\n10    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v.

The\r\nspecific indignity against which sovereign immunity pro\r\ntects is the insult to a State of being haled into court\r\nwithout its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases\r\nreasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the\r\nsuit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state\r\ntreasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just\r\nbecause the suit happens to be brought by another state\r\nagency. Respondents’ asserted dignitary harm is simply\r\nunconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.\r\n  The dissent complains that applying Ex parte Young to\r\nthis lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the op\r\nposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.\r\nPost, at 7. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of\r\nletting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have\r\nnothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity—\r\nwhether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather\r\nthan against its officers. But it is not a consequence of the\r\nfederal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if\r\nthe federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dis\r\nsent would require. There also, “[w]hatever the decision\r\n——————\r\n  5 The dissent accuses us of circular reasoning, because we “wrongly\r\n\r\nassum[e] [that] Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case.” Post, at 10. That would be true if we were\r\nrelying on the Commonwealth’s waiver of sovereign immunity. We are\r\nnot. We rely upon Ex parte Young. We say that Virginia has only itself\r\nto blame for the position in which it finds itself, not because it con\r\nsented to suit, but because it created a state entity to sue, instead of\r\nleaving the task to a private entity. It did not have to know that this\r\nwould allow suit in federal court. Know or not know, Ex parte Young\r\nproduces that result.\r\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nin the litigation, . . . [t]he Commonwealth will win[, a]nd\r\nthe Commonwealth will lose.” Ibid. Nor would sending\r\nthe matter to state court even avoid the prospect that “a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail,” ibid., since the state-court loser could\r\nalways ask this Court to review the matter by certiorari.\r\n(Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of\r\nsovereign immunity? But see Cohens v. Virginia, 6\r\nWheat. 264 (1821).)6 And of course precisely the same\r\nthing would happen if respondents specifically waived\r\ntheir sovereign-immunity objections in this very case. Yet\r\nno one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign\r\nimmunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of\r\nEx parte Young, there has been no violation of sovereign\r\nimmunity, the prospect of a federal judge’s resolving\r\nVOPA’s dispute with respondents does not make it so.\r\n   We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the\r\nFederal Government’s power to affect the internal opera\r\ntions of a State. See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521\r\nU. S. 898 (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state\r\nofficers); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 579 (1911) (Con\r\ngress may not dictate a State’s capital). But those limits\r\nmust be found in some textual provision or structural\r\npremise of the Constitution. Additional limits cannot be\r\nsmuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a\r\nsuit in federal court that does not violate the State’s sov\r\nereign immunity. 7\r\n——————\r\n  6 The dissent agrees that because of the “ ‘constitutional plan,’ ” post,\r\n\r\nat 8, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages\r\nand Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990),\r\nthis Court can adjudicate disputes between state agencies without\r\noffending sovereign immunity. But explaining away exceptions to its\r\ntheory does not advance the ball. It has not demonstrated that sover\r\neign immunity has anything at all to say about federal courts’ adjudi\r\ncating interagency disputes.\r\n  7 We have no occasion to pass on other questions of federalism lurk\r\n\r\ning in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper\r\n12    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v.

Respondents rightly observe that federal\r\ncourts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by\r\nstate agencies against other state officials. That does give\r\nus pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a\r\nconstitutional infirmity, see, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ____,\r\n____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity\r\ndecisions have traditionally warned against “ ‘anomalous\r\nand unheard-of proceedings or suits,’ ” Alden, 527 U. S., at\r\n727 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 18).\r\n  Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past con\r\nstitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is\r\nthe case here. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young\r\nexception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two\r\nthings: first, a federal right that it possesses against its\r\nparent State; and second, authority to sue other state\r\nofficials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto\r\nwielded by the state government. These conditions will\r\nrarely coincide—and at least the latter of them cannot\r\nexist without the consent of the State that created the\r\nagency and defined its powers.            See post, at 3–4\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). We are unaware that the\r\nnecessary conditions have ever presented themselves\r\nexcept in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the\r\nparties have referred us to no examples.8 Thus, the ap\r\n——————\r\nexercise of Congress’s enumerated powers. As JUSTICE KENNEDY ob\r\nserves, whether the Acts run afoul of some other constitutional pro\r\nvision (i.e., besides the Eleventh Amendment) “cannot be permitted\r\nto distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction.” Post, at 5 (concur\r\nring opinion).\r\n   8 We think greatly exaggerated the dissent’s concern that, “[g]iven the\r\n\r\nnumber of state agencies across the country that enjoy independent\r\nlitigating authority,” today’s decision “could potentially lead to all sorts\r\nof litigation in federal courts addressing internal state government\r\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

In any event, we are satisfied, for the\r\nreasons we have explained, that—novelty notwithstand\r\ning—the principles undergirding the Ex parte Young doc\r\ntrine support its application to actions of this kind.\r\n                      *      *    *\r\n  Like the Court of Appeals, we are mindful of the central\r\nrole autonomous States play in our federal system, and\r\nwary of approving new encroachments on their sover\r\neignty. But we conclude no such encroachment is occa\r\nsioned by straightforwardly applying Ex parte Young to\r\nallow this suit. It was Virginia law that created VOPA\r\nand gave it the power to sue state officials. In that cir\r\ncumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\r\nto VOPA’s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the\r\nsame terms as any other litigant.\r\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\r\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                                           It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\r\ndecision of this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\ndisputes.” Post, at 11.

S. 89, 103 (1984) (“Under the theory\r\nof Young, such a suit [for restitution] would not be one\r\nagainst the State since the federal-law allegation would\r\nstrip the state officer of his official authority. Neverthe\r\nless, retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh\r\nAmendment”). And Pennhurst declined to extend Young\r\nto suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need\r\nto ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justi\r\nfication for restricting state sovereignty. 465 U. S., at\r\n105–106.\r\n   The “straightforward inquiry” of Verizon Md. derives\r\nfrom Edelman and Pennhurst, both of which defined im\r\nportant limits on Young in order to respect state sover\r\neignty while still adhering to principles necessary to im\r\nplement the Supremacy Clause. As a result, Verizon Md.\r\nincorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to\r\nreject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved\r\nthe same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense\r\nthat was at issue in Young. But when Young’s application\r\nis explored in novel contexts, as in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene\r\nTribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997), and also in this case,\r\nthe inquiry “proves more complex,” Verizon Md., supra, at\r\n648 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\r\n   In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protec\r\ntion and Advocacy may rely on Young, despite the some\r\nwhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue\r\nofficials of the same State in federal court. In the posture\r\nof the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as\r\nsumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it\r\nseeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the\r\nSupremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important\r\ninterest is the need to preserve “the dignity and respect\r\nafforded a State, which the immunity is designed to pro\r\ntect.” Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 268. Permitting a state\r\nagency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\r\n\r\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\nimplicate the State’s important sovereign interest in using\r\nits own courts to control the distribution of power among\r\nits own agents. But the affront to the State’s dignity is\r\ndiminished to some extent when it is noted that if the\r\nState had elected the alternate course of designating a\r\nprivate protection and advocacy system it then would have\r\navoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat\r\ning in the federal program. The availability of that alter\r\nnate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of\r\nthe validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only\r\nquestion here is the reach of the Young exception.\r\n   Virginia’s concern that the holding here upsets the\r\nfederal balance is further mitigated by the various protec\r\ntions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure\r\nthat state officials do not too often call upon the federal\r\ncourts to resolve their intramural disputes.\r\n   First, and most important, state law must authorize an\r\nagency or official to sue another arm of the State. If\r\nStates do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in\r\nfederal court, they need not empower their officers or\r\nagencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if\r\nstate officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they\r\nmay invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal\r\ncapacities.\r\n   Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state\r\nlaw as to an officer’s or agency’s power to sue, or any other\r\nstate-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts\r\nshould abstain under Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman\r\nCo., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor\r\ntance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial\r\nintervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is\r\nnecessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve\r\na dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution\r\nof the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.\r\nLikewise, certification of questions of state law to the state\r\ncourts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con\r\n4    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\r\n\r\ntroversy. Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391\r\n(1974) (Certification “helps build a cooperative judicial\r\nfederalism”).\r\n   Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state\r\nofficials or agencies to assert against other arms of the\r\nState. True, officials may assert that their personal fed\r\neral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam\r\nple where the State engages in discriminatory employ\r\nment practices. But the statutory framework in the case\r\nnow before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state\r\nagency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat\r\nutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers\r\nor agencies, and the Constitution’s rights-creating Clauses\r\nprotect persons rather than officers. Because the Young\r\nexception is available only to those who assert federal\r\nviolations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern\r\nment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar\r\nrow one.\r\n   All this is simply to underscore that the program at\r\nissue may present constitutional questions but that the\r\nparties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does\r\nnot argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend\r\ning power under Article I, §8 by forcing a state that wishes\r\nto designate a public agency as its advocacy system to\r\nallow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring\r\nthat the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42\r\nU. S. C. §15043(a)(2)(G) (system must “be independent of\r\nany agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita\r\ntion to individuals with developmental disabilities”);\r\n§15044(a)(2) (“[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the\r\ngoverning board may be appointed by the chief executive\r\nofficer of the State”). Young—a court-made doctrine based\r\non convenience, fiction, or both—neither implicates nor\r\nsubsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the\r\nexcessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be\r\nmost cautious before deciding cases that might later lead\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming, as the Court\r\nmust, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow\r\nquestion is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the\r\nsovereign immunity bar.\r\n  One might doubt whether the constitutional question\r\nmay be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court\r\nwields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to\r\nvindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court\r\nshould not extend the fiction in the name of claims that\r\nmay rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is\r\nmisplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs\r\ncourts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre\r\nserves its validity, but the specter of a statute’s unconsti\r\ntutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent\r\nquestion of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a\r\nstatute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate\r\nthe case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal\r\nright for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect\r\nto invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court\r\nshould not permit the commission of acts that violate a\r\nfederal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted\r\nbeyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed\r\nto vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious\r\naffront to state sovereignty in light of the options available\r\nto the State under the program, it may proceed.\r\n  With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion.\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

This\r\nhas never happened before. In order to reach this unset\r\ntling result, the Court extends the fiction of Ex parte\r\nYoung—what we have called an “empty formalism”—well\r\nbeyond the circumstances of that case. Because I cannot\r\nsubscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of\r\nwhat we have also called “a narrow exception” to a State’s\r\nsovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.\r\n                            I\r\n\r\n                            A\r\n\r\n  “The federal system established by our Constitution\r\npreserves the sovereign status of the States.” Alden v.\r\nMaine, 527 U. S. 706, 714 (1999). As confirmed by the\r\nEleventh Amendment, “[a]n integral component of that\r\nresiduary and inviolable sovereignty” is the States’ “im\r\nmunity from private suits.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.\r\nSouth Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 751–753\r\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); Hans v. Louisi\r\n2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nana, 134 U. S. 1, 13 (1890) (“ ‘It is inherent in the nature of\r\nsovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual\r\nwithout its consent’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 81 (A.\r\nHamilton))). “The preeminent purpose of state sovereign\r\nimmunity is to accord States the dignity that is consistent\r\nwith their status as sovereign entities.” Federal Maritime\r\nComm’n, supra, at 760. Accordingly, any time a State is\r\nhaled into federal court against its will, “the dignity and\r\nrespect afforded [that] State, which [sovereign] immunity\r\nis designed to protect, are placed in jeopardy.” Idaho v.\r\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268 (1997).\r\nThe immunity does not turn on whether relief will be\r\nawarded; “[t]he Eleventh Amendment is concerned not\r\nonly with the States’ ability to withstand suit, but with\r\ntheir privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico Aqueduct and\r\nSewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139,\r\n147, n. 5 (1993). See Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at\r\n769 (“the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to\r\nprotect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dig\r\nnity and respect due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)).\r\n  Because of the key role state sovereign immunity plays\r\nin our federal system, the Court has recognized only a few\r\nexceptions to that immunity. The sole one relevant here is\r\nthe “narrow exception,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\r\n517 U. S. 44, 76 (1996), established by our decision in Ex\r\nparte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). In Ex parte Young, the\r\nCourt held that private litigants could seek an injunction\r\nin federal court against a state official, prohibiting him\r\nfrom enforcing a state law claimed to violate the Federal\r\nConstitution. See id., at 159–168. As we have often ob\r\nserved, Ex parte Young rests on the “obvious fiction,”\r\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 270, that such a suit is not\r\nreally against the State, but rather against an individual\r\nwho has been “stripped of his official or representative\r\ncharacter” because of his unlawful conduct, Ex parte\r\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nYoung, supra, at 159–160.1\r\n  While we have consistently acknowledged the important\r\nrole Ex parte Young plays in “promot[ing] the vindication\r\nof federal rights,” we have been cautious not to give that\r\ndecision “an expansive interpretation.” Pennhurst State\r\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105, 102\r\n(1984). Indeed, the history of our Ex parte Young juris\r\nprudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this\r\nnarrow exception is “narrowly construed,” 465 U. S., at\r\n114, n. 25. We have, for example, held that the fiction of\r\nEx parte Young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff\r\nseeks retroactive relief, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,\r\n678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on\r\nstate law, Pennhurst, supra, at 106; where the federal law\r\nviolation is no longer “ongoing,” Green v. Mansour, 474\r\nU. S. 64, 71 (1985); “where Congress has prescribed a\r\ndetailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a\r\nState” of the claimed federal right, Seminole Tribe, supra,\r\nat 74; and where “special sovereignty interests” are impli\r\ncated, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281.\r\n  We recently stated that when “determining whether the\r\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend\r\nment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightfor\r\nward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly\r\ncharacterized as prospective.” Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\r\nServ. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 645 (2002) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). But not every plaintiff who\r\ncomplies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit\r\nunder Ex parte Young. Indeed, in Verizon itself the Court\r\nwent beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in con\r\n——————\r\n   1 Ex parte Young also rests on the “well-recognized irony that an offi\r\n\r\ncial’s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst\r\nState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105 (1984)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n4     VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nsidering whether Ex parte Young applied. After deciding\r\nthe plaintiffs “clearly satisfie[d]” the “straightforward\r\ninquiry,” the Court went on to examine whether Congress\r\nhad created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in\r\nSeminole Tribe. 535 U. S., at 645, 647–648 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Only after determining that\r\nCongress had not done so did the Court conclude that the\r\nsuit could go forward under Ex parte Young.\r\n  If Verizon’s formulation set forth the only requirements\r\nfor bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our\r\nrecent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole\r\nTribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often “found\r\nfederal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when\r\nthat suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order\r\nto end a continuing violation of federal law.” 517 U. S., at\r\n73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,\r\nhowever, that the “situation presented” there was “suffi\r\nciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action so as to preclude the availability of\r\nthat doctrine.” Ibid.2\r\n  In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an\r\n“allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the\r\nrequested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to\r\ninvoke the Young fiction.” 521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis\r\nadded). The Court held, however, that the action could\r\nnot proceed under Ex parte Young because it implicated\r\n“special sovereignty interests”—in that case, the State’s\r\n——————\r\n  2 While I agree that in Seminole Tribe “we refused to permit suit to\r\n\r\nproceed” under Ex parte Young because Congress “had foreclosed\r\nrecourse to the doctrine,” ante, at 7, n. 3, that simply confirms my point\r\nthat the availability of Young depends on more than just whether\r\nVerizon’s prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, Seminole Tribe\r\nmakes clear that a plaintiff who files a “complaint alleg[ing] an ongoing\r\nviolation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as\r\nprospective,” Verizon, 535 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under\r\nYoung.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Allain, 478 U. S. 265\r\n(1986), there are “certain types of cases that formally meet\r\nthe Young requirements of a state official acting inconsis\r\ntently with federal law but that stretch that case too far\r\nand would upset the balance of federal and state interests\r\nthat it embodies.” Id., at 277. This is one of those cases.\r\n  In refusing to extend Ex parte Young to claims that\r\ninvolve “special sovereignty interests,” the Court in Coeur\r\nd’Alene Tribe warned against a rote application of the Ex\r\nparte Young fiction:\r\n        “To interpret Young to permit a federal-court action\r\n    to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory\r\n    and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,\r\n    named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere\r\n    to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle\r\n    . . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a\r\n    real limitation on a federal court’s federal-question ju\r\n    risdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh\r\n    Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me\r\n    chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the\r\n    Young exception must reflect a proper understanding\r\n    of its role in our federal system and respect for state\r\n    courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic\r\n    tion.” 521 U. S., at 270.\r\n                              B\r\n   It is undisputed that petitioner’s complaint alleges an\r\nongoing violation of federal law by a state official and\r\nseeks only prospective relief. If this were a “traditional Ex\r\nparte Young action,” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti\r\ntioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under\r\nthat case. This, however, is anything but a traditional\r\ncase—and petitioner is anything but a typical Ex parte\r\nYoung plaintiff.\r\n6    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Unlike the plaintiffs in Ex parte Young—and, for that\r\nmatter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to\r\ninvoke Ex parte Young before this Court—petitioner is a\r\nstate agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in\r\nfederal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante\r\nat 12–13, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (“Perhaps the most telling indi\r\ncation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of\r\nhistorical precedent” (internal quotation marks omitted));\r\ncf. Alden, 527 U. S., at 743–745; Printz v. United States,\r\n521 U. S. 898, 905–910, 918, 925 (1997). This is especially\r\ntrue in light of the “presumption” we articulated more\r\nthan 120 years ago in Hans v. Louisiana, that States are\r\nimmune from suits that would have been “anomalous and\r\nunheard of when the Constitution was adopted.” Hans,\r\n134 U. S., at 18; see also Alden, supra, at 727 (invoking\r\npresumption).\r\n   Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of\r\nsovereign immunity, we have “attribute[d] great signifi\r\ncance” to the absence of analogous suits “at the time of the\r\nfounding or for many years thereafter.” Federal Maritime\r\nComm’n, 535 U. S., at 755. This sort of suit was not only\r\nanomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it\r\nwas anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The Hans\r\npresumption applies here with full force.\r\n   The Court speculates that these suits have not previ\r\nously arisen because the necessary conditions—state\r\nagencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state\r\nveto—are themselves novel. See ante, at 12; see also ante,\r\nat 3–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim\r\nply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for\r\nmere rote application of Ex parte Young.\r\n   In addition to its novel character, petitioner’s complaint\r\n“conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that\r\nunderlie the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nat 106. In Alden, we held that state sovereign immu-\r\nnity prohibited Congress from authorizing “private suits\r\nagainst nonconsenting States in their own courts.” 527\r\nU. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit\r\none branch of state government, the “State’s own courts,”\r\n“to coerce the other branches of the State” and “to turn the\r\nState against itself.” Ibid.\r\n  Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state\r\nagency on one side, and state executive officials on the\r\nother. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov\r\nernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.\r\nHere extending Young forces the State to defend itself\r\nagainst itself in federal court.\r\n  Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title\r\nof “The Commonwealth of Virginia” in its complaint, App.\r\n10; respondents are state officials acting in an official\r\ncapacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one\r\nthing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the\r\nCommonwealth will lose. Because of today’s holding, a\r\nfederal judge will resolve which part of the Common\r\nwealth will prevail.\r\n  Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal\r\ncourt; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that\r\nthis intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.\r\nThis is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to\r\nguard against. See ante, at 10 (“The specific indignity\r\nagainst which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to\r\na State of being haled into court without its consent”).\r\nThat indignity is compounded when the State is haled into\r\nfederal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal\r\nstate dispute.\r\n  The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no\r\nsovereign interest in determining where such disputes will\r\nbe resolved. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 6. It is one thing\r\nfor a State to decide that its components may sue one\r\n8     VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                        v. STEWART\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\nanother in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite\r\nanother thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal\r\ncourt against the State’s wishes. For this reason, the\r\nCourt’s examples of other suits pitting state entities\r\nagainst one another are inapposite. In each of those hy\r\npotheticals, the State consented to having a particular\r\nforum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.3\r\n   In sum, the “special sovereignty interests” implicated\r\nhere make this case “sufficiently different from that giving\r\nrise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to pre\r\nclude the availability of that doctrine.” Seminole Tribe,\r\n517 U. S., at 73. I would cling to reality and not extend\r\nthe fiction of Ex parte Young to cover petitioner’s suit.\r\n                             II\r\n   The Court offers several justifications for its expansion\r\nof Ex parte Young. None is persuasive.\r\n   The Court first contends that whether the Ex parte\r\nYoung fiction should be applied turns only on the “relief\r\nsought” in a case. Ante, at 8–9 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior\r\ncases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.\r\nSee, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664–671. That may well\r\nbe because “the difference between the type of relief\r\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted\r\n——————\r\n  3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this\r\n\r\nCourt from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it\r\nhad been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that “it is\r\ninherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes\r\ncognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court\r\nof the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to\r\nthe original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.” McKes\r\nson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of\r\nBusiness Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted). By contrast, there is nothing “inherent in the\r\nconstitutional plan” that warrants lower federal courts handling\r\nintrastate disputes absent a State’s consent.\r\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

But the Court is\r\nwrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and\r\ncategorically conclude that there can be no other basis for\r\ndetermining whether to extend Ex parte Young’s fiction.\r\n   The thrust of the Court’s argument appears to be that,\r\nbecause the relief sought here is no different from that\r\nwhich could be sought in a suit by a private protection and\r\nadvocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should\r\nalso apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7–\r\n9. But private entities are different from public ones:\r\nThey are private. When private litigants are involved, the\r\nState is not turned against itself.\r\n   Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there\r\nis indeed a real difference between a suit against the State\r\nbrought by a private party and one brought by a state\r\nagency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal\r\nism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate\r\nresults may be the same—a full stomach and a dead\r\nbody—it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.\r\nI would think it more an affront to someone’s dignity to be\r\nsued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While\r\nneither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would\r\nbe equally received.\r\n   The Court also contends that petitioner’s ability to sue\r\nstate officials in federal court “is a consequence of Vir\r\nginia’s own decision to establish a public [protection and\r\nadvocacy] system.” Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia\r\nhas consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That\r\nargument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek\r\ncertiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565\r\nF. 3d 110, 116–118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.\r\n   Instead the Court claims that “Virginia has only itself to\r\nblame”—if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it\r\ncould have chosen to establish a private entity instead.\r\nAnte, at 9–10, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,\r\n10   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY\r\n                       v. STEWART \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nconcurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect\r\nthat an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from\r\nchallenge simply because a constitutional alternative is\r\navailable. And here the public and private systems are\r\nnot interchangeable alternatives in any event.\r\n   The Court’s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes\r\nVirginia knew in advance the answer to the question\r\npresented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte\r\nYoung applies to this arrangement—that for the first time\r\nin history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in\r\nfederal court—can the Court suggest that Virginia know\r\ningly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.\r\n   In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir\r\nginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent\r\nlitigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same\r\n“as any other litigant.” Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not\r\nlike any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys\r\nsome independence from the State’s executive branch, that\r\ndoes not mean petitioner is independent from the State.\r\nAs noted, petitioner certainly views itself as “The Com\r\nmonwealth of Virginia,” App. 10, and would presumably\r\ninvoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of\r\nsovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how\r\na State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among\r\ndifferent state agencies or officials.\r\n   The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because\r\npetitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it\r\nmay sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13\r\n(“the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle” since it\r\n“was Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the\r\npower to sue state officials”). There is more to this case\r\nthan merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the\r\nAttorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions\r\ncited by the Court say nothing about actions against the\r\nState in federal court.\r\n   If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,\r\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthen scores of state entities now “suddenly possess the\r\nauthority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other\r\nstate officials” in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.\r\nThere would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to\r\nsuch suits. Given the number of state agencies across the\r\ncountry that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,\r\ne.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11–\r\n13, the Court’s decision today could potentially lead to all\r\nsorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal\r\nstate government disputes.\r\n   And there is also no reason to think that the Court’s\r\nholding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to\r\nthe Court’s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some\r\nlevel of independence could as a matter of federal law\r\nbring suit against other state officials in federal court.\r\nDisputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet\r\nrooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  No one questions the continued vitality or importance of\r\nthe doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte\r\nYoung was about affording relief to a private party against\r\nunconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving\r\na dispute between two different state actors. That is a\r\nmatter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.\r\n  Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419\r\n(1793)—permitting States to be sued by private parties in\r\nfederal court—“created such a shock of surprise” through\r\nout the country “that the Eleventh Amendment was at\r\nonce proposed and adopted.” Principality of Monaco v.\r\nMississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934). It is fair to say that\r\ntoday’s decision will probably not trigger a similar re\r\nsponse.
